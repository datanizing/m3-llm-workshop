In 1945, representatives of 51 States, one of them my country, agreed to create the United Nations.@@@By speaking for the first time before the General Assembly as President of the Republic of Paraguay.@@@I wish to begin my speech by expressing our recognition of the work of the United Nations, which since its inception has provided a global framework of cooperation among nations to promote peace, human rights and the wellbeing of peoples.@@@Seventy-eight years later, multilateralism faces very visible challenges in terms of effectiveness and legitimacy.@@@In a world of so much wealth, levels of poverty and inequality remain stubbornly high while mass migration associated with armed conflicts and lack of opportunities, international terrorism, transnational crime and geopolitical tensions represent challenges before which the mechanisms of cooperation and governance that have prevailed over the past almost eight decades are clearly outdated.@@@The lack of tangible results, the perceived ineffectiveness of multilateral institutions and the difficulties in addressing global problems effectively have generated frustration and led to a rise in the feeling that national interests should take precedence over multilateral cooperation.@@@The imposition of certain cultural or ideological trends or approaches is perceived, not without reason, as interference in national sovereignty and values, which erodes trust and weakens the will to cooperate at the multilateral level.@@@Consequently, increasing levels of mistrust can be observed among Member States, which hinders cooperation and the willingness to compromise for the common good.@@@The 2008 crisis, the recent pandemic and, today, the conflict in Ukraine have revealed the weaknesses and limitations of multilateral institutions in their ability to face challenges with global impact and systemic risk.@@@In the latter case, the United Nations and its Security Council have adopted measures whose results are sadly far from being encouraging.@@@Despite having suffered the misfortunes of two unjust wars, one of which put us on the brink of extinction as a nation, the spirit and history of Paraguay compel us to bet on dialogue, and not on force, as a mechanism to resolve any controversy, as demonstrated by the 1924 Treaty to Avoid or Prevent Conflicts between the American States, known as the Gondra Convention, proposed by a Paraguayan and approved by all Latin American countries unanimously and without a single amendment, whose purpose was precisely to avoid and prevent wars between American States.@@@With humility but with great conviction, we urge all parties involved in the conflict in Ukraine to immediately stop military actions to avoid further victims and damage.@@@We support the peace initiatives promoted by Brazil, a brother country and strategic ally, as well as by Pope Francis, whose moving presence is a source of inspiration to all humankind.@@@There is no doubt that we need to work on the review and reform of the mechanisms, measures and institutional capacities of multilateral organizations to prevent new wars like that ravaging Ukraine, but with or without reforms we need to put an end to the merciless loss of so many human lives.@@@We need to work to strengthen the United Nations with a view to building new capabilities that will allow it to respond effectively and efficiently to permanent and changing global challenges.@@@Within the framework of the reform and expansion of the Security Council.@@@Paraguay considers that the organic and functional structure of the United Nations must reflect the dynamics of the international scenario on a participatory, democratic and equitable basis that observes the guiding principles of the Charter of the United Nations for promote peace, security and prosperity of our countries on equal terms.@@@In that regard, the Government of Paraguay expresses its support for the Republic of China on Taiwan to be an integral part of the United Nations system.@@@Climate change represents a great planetary challenge, and we must take both rigorous and fair measures to avoid further damage to the planet and its inhabitants.@@@Trade restrictions based on criteria such as agricultural practices or environmental standards generate discontent and uncertainty and are unfair and discriminatory barriers, since they try to extrapolate realities from highly developed regions to developing territories, without taking into account their differences or adequately valuing the particular environmental mitigation practices of those territories.@@@That has required less developed countries to assume responsibility for the environmental damage caused by industrialization in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, when there were no mitigation measures, and they have been obliged to do so at the expense of giving up opportunities for commercial expansion, job creation and wealth creation.@@@There is a need to address those concerns and promote a more equitable and collaborative approach that takes into account the specific realities and needs of each country in the context of its multilateral decisions related to environmental standards.@@@Paraguay has shown the world that we are leaders in the production of hydroelectric energy, a clean and sustainable source that supplies both our internal needs and those of our neighbours.@@@We have put Paraguay on the map as an example to follow in the transition towards a more sustainable world.@@@While other countries are still arguing about reducing emissions, we have already taken concrete and effective measures.@@@We are a concrete example of how a nation can exploit natural resources in a responsible and sustainable manner to promote economic development and, at the same time, mitigate climate change.@@@For more than 30 years, we have been adopting sustainable agricultural practices that not only ensure a prosperous future for our farmers, but also guarantee the integrity of our land and our water resources.@@@We have acted with courage and responsibility, basing our public policies on science and evidence.@@@For years, we were the subject of criticism and unfair accusations, but today, thanks to the work of multiple administrations.@@@I can firmly report that the facts speak for themselves.@@@Some 44 per cent of Paraguayan territory has preserved its forest cover, while 95 per cent of the area planted with cereals and oilseeds in Paraguay in 2022 implements sustainable technologies, such as direct sowing and crop rotation, and has been free of deforestation since 2004 a result of our zero-deforestation policy.@@@Those data are irrefutable proof that it is possible to achieve a balance between agricultural production and the conservation of our natural resources, and that the Paraguayan countryside is prepared to enter the most demanding markets internationally, respecting the principles of clean and sustainable production.@@@.@@@But we do not stop there.@@@Paraguay has also committed to the recomposition of our natural ecosystems.@@@We are promoting reforestation and species conservation, and we have undertaken the participatory construction of the national forest restoration plan.@@@Additionally, we have dramatically reduced extreme poverty over the past two decades, demonstrating that it is possible to protect our environment while prospering economically.@@@Paraguay reaffirms its commitment to the central values and objectives of the United Nations.@@@We understand our shared but differentiated responsibilities and we are willing to lead by example on the path to a more sustainable and equitable world.@@@Today we face four global challenges that are generating geopolitical tensions: access to water, food security, energy sufficiency and resilience in logistics chains.@@@Since Paraguay is a Power on these great issues, we are called to be protagonists in the concert of nations.@@@Our subsoil is home to the world’s largest reserve of fresh water, including the Guarani aquifer that we share with our neighbours.@@@Paraguay is a global food supplier and one of the few countries in the world capable of producing food for its population and for more than 100 million people around the world.@@@In hydroelectric energy, we are pioneers in regional energy integration and today we are determined to move towards greater energy efficiency and sustainability.@@@In that context.@@@Paraguay aspires to become the logistics centre of the South American Bioceanic Corridor, which is turning our geographical centrality into an opportunity and strengthening integration with neighbouring countries and Pacific markets.@@@That trade corridor will be a source of renewal and empowerment for the South American Common Market and the Pacific Alliance, promoting greater rapprochement between both blocs.@@@Furthermore, due to its intersection with the Paraguay-Parana waterway, that multimodal network will become the most competitive way to transport products from different countries to Pacific ports, facilitating consensus for the management of river navigation.@@@Without a doubt, it will give new impetus to the South American integration process and transform the vision with which we will resolve conflicts that may arise.@@@Paraguay is determined to abandon its old image as an island surrounded by land, as our Cervantes Prize winner Don Augusto Roa Bastos described 
it, and, following its historical, geographical and cultural vocation, become the centre of South American integration.@@@Therefore, one of our main strategic objectives will be to contribute to improving regional integration.@@@In that sense, managing the waterway, the aquifers, the Bioceanic Corridor, the hydroelectric plants and the navigation of our rivers is a delicate process of balance between the integration and sovereignty of our peoples.@@@We are aware of the progress made on the path of integration, but we cannot be satisfied and must move forward with courage and determination.@@@Latin America is the region of the world with the greatest development potential, but we can develop that potential only by respecting each other, working together and in harmony.@@@Since the last decade of the twentieth century, as a country we have been going through a process of building and strengthening our democratic institutions.@@@This year, we have renewed the political leadership of the country through a transparent electoral process, with broad citizen participation and in which the Paraguayan people expressed their will with a firm democratic vocation and full confidence in the rule of law.@@@Today Paraguay is experiencing its greatest historical period of democratic coexistence, with more than 35 uninterrupted years of validating the noblest values of a free, participatory and pluralist democracy, and convinced that there is no acceptable system other than that of non-negotiable exercise of human rights and freedom.@@@Paraguay is the country of the prose of Augusto Roa Bastos, the universal music of Jose Asuncion Flores and the nanduti-voiced guitar of Berta Rojas.@@@The country has a rhythm that was born to capture the spirit of its Guarani language.@@@The name of that music is Guarania, and today it hopes to be recognized as a universal heritage because it is an ambassador who travels the world with our emotions.@@@My country values peace, sustainable development and integration among peoples because we are a country that has been reborn from its ashes following a war of extermination that truncated the early development process of a nation that, already at the dawn of industrial revolution, had developed one of the first interurban railways in South America, had shipyards and iron foundries, and, above all, was betting very heavily on the formation of its human capital through education.@@@The reconstruction after the catastrophe of 1870, which annihilated 90 per cent of the Paraguayan male population, was led by patriotic fellow nationals, without international financial or technological support and with a small flow of European migrants who arrived and settled in the country despite a narrative that discredited us.@@@But, as President Bernardino Caballero said in immortal words in his presidential message of 1884.@@@Paraguay has the incontestable merit of having risen from its ruins without having requested foreign assistance to do so.@@@It has persevered with that rare self-denial that is the virtue of the strong, and it has triumphed.@@@It is the architect of its own destinies.@@@It is impossible not to mention here the fundamental role of Paraguayan women in the heroic task of rebuilding the country.@@@It is not for nothing that the Paraguayan woman is recognized as the most glorious in America and the cornerstone on which our nation is built.@@@With firm and determined steps.@@@Paraguay continues to strengthen its institutions and its economy.@@@After occupying the position of poorest country in South America for decades, today we are an upper middle-income country, with high credibility in international financial markets that is bringing us closer to the desired investment grade, with high production standards certified in accordance with international standards, with transparency and, above all, with macroeconomic stability that stands out worldwide and is supported by fiscal and monetary discipline and a permanent effort to improve public management.@@@Paraguay today is standing and ready to fulfil its mission in history.@@@That is why we speak of the resurgence of a giant, but we do so not with expansionist or grandiose zeal but with the firm conviction of a people proud of its roots, its heroic and brave history and with the deepest confidence in its future greatness.@@@For decades, this lofty stage served an important purpose — to hold discussions on how to make life on the planet safer and better.@@@Regrettably, over the past decade, that discussion has not been translated into concrete positive action.@@@As a result, global politics have deteriorated.@@@That trend has had a negative impact on all other spheres of international relations.@@@What is the role of the United Nations in these processes?@@@To serve merely as a stage for discussion?@@@That is the role that many ascribe to it.@@@It is therefore no surprise that the Organization is often reproached for its inaction and inability to stop the growing global chaos and to stop the triple crisis — of security, food and energy — that has engulfed the entire world.@@@Of course, such reproaches are not entirely fair.@@@The United Nations is all of us.@@@The Organization can do only as much as its Member States allow it to do.@@@On the one hand, that is perfectly logical.@@@On the other, it is fraught with determinism.@@@It implies that the United Nations is hostage to external forces and will be able to effectively fulfil its mandate only when there are positive changes in its environment.@@@Does that not sound familiar?@@@That was the same prevailing attitude towards the League of Nations before the Second World War.@@@Just a century ago, on the shores of Lake Geneva, many, like us, discussed the threats of their time.@@@However, those discussions had little effect, and the world inexorably slipped into the abyss.@@@The League of Nations was consigned to oblivion because of its uselessness.@@@The United Nations could suffer the same fate if it remains a passive observer.@@@We are convinced that the overwhelming majority of Member States do not wish to see such an outcome.@@@If that is so, then the United Nations must not wait, but act.@@@The Organization must work to produce positive changes in external circumstances and ensure peace, stability and sustainable development on our planet.@@@That is an immense task given the current toxic global politics.@@@However, if we, as Member States and the reasonable global majority, help our Organization, then it can rise to that task.@@@In the context of assessing Soviet Russia’s relations with the West a century ago, the famous American diplomat George Kennan said that:
“some degree of conflict and antagonism is present in every international relationship; [therefore] some measure of compromise is necessary everywhere, if political societies are to live together on the same planet”.@@@Let us be guided by that wise advice, and despite the high degree of antagonism in today’s international system, let us seek compromise and harmony everywhere.@@@And let us act within the framework of the United Nations.@@@We see a number of key steps that should be taken in that regard.@@@First, the policy of ostracism at the United Nations must be stopped.@@@It is a practice that runs counter to the very essence of our Organization.@@@After all, according to the Charter of the United Nations, all members are equal.@@@Let us treat each other with respect and equality.@@@No one should stoop to insults and disrespectful rhetoric, such as the use of the word “regime” to describe the legitimate Governments of Member States.@@@Similarly, certain countries should refrain from trying to restrict the participation of any other States Members in the work of our Organization.@@@Such actions are a direct violation of the Charter.@@@Moreover, the entire history of multilateral diplomacy has taught us that we can achieve positive results only through inclusiveness and cooperation.@@@Secondly, certain Member States must cease their attempts to turn the United Nations and its system into instruments to serve their foreign policies.@@@Politicizing our Organization only discredits it in the eyes of ordinary people around the world.@@@After all, the United Nations was created for cooperation in the interests of people, not to settle scores between one State and another.@@@We believe that bilateral issues should not be brought into international organizations to serve as an apple of discord.@@@Thirdly, we can — and should — work productively in the United Nations on our common challenges.@@@We should therefore work to resolve them using an approach that starts with the simplest and moves on the most complex.@@@The most difficult problems — let us call them first-tier issues — are undoubtedly those related to security.@@@They are the most dangerous, even explosive, apple of discord in global politics.@@@Then there are other, second-tier issues, such as combating climate change, transnational crime, pandemics and diseases, which can be solved.@@@Every country in the world suffers equally from their effects, and they all are equally interested in responding effectively to such challenges.@@@Let us therefore intensify our work 
in those areas.@@@Ordinary people around the world are expecting results.@@@Let me give a very clear example of how we can work together successfully even in the midst of sharp political disagreements.@@@At the thirty-second session of the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, held in Vienna in May.@@@Belarus submitted a draft resolution on combating trafficking in persons in supply chains.@@@Initially, our initiative was perceived negatively by Western countries, for political reasons.@@@However, once engaged in the negotiation process, they realized the importance of the initiative and began to work for a positive result.@@@The resolution was adopted by consensus and all the parties involved have begun to implement it.@@@Let us apply that same approach to all other second-tier issues of concern.@@@In particular, we are hoping to see the same constructive efforts during this session of the Assembly on Belarus’s biennial draft resolution entitled “Improving the coordination of efforts against trafficking in persons”.@@@However, where common sense is most needed for us is in finding a solution to the global food crisis.@@@Let us assume that there is enough food in the world for everyone.@@@At the same time, however, millions around the world are going hungry.@@@That contradiction is a result of the unilateral illegal sanctions that Western nations have imposed in violation of the Charter against countries they do not like or in order to gain a competitive economic advantage.@@@In turn, sanctions limit the ability to export food and fertilizers to the developing nations that need them the most.@@@Consequently, the global food crisis is human-made, not systemic.@@@As such, it is easy to resolve.@@@All that is needed is to remove those illegal barriers.@@@The countries that have set up the barriers should remove them.@@@And that applies not only to global food security but to all other areas of international life.@@@The unilateral coercive measures imposed by the West, directly or indirectly, against virtually every other State in the world must be immediately removed.@@@Both common sense and the common interests of all people on the planet demand that.@@@We believe that achieving progress in resolving global second-tier issues within the framework of the United Nations can help us to build a foundation of mutual trust for collective and effective work on security issues.@@@In that area, we are witnessing a power shift from the West towards the rest of the world.@@@Such shifts in history have often been accompanied by wars.@@@However, it is in our power to channel that process onto a peaceful track.@@@The best way to do that is to expand the permanent membership of the Security Council.@@@The Council does not reflect today’s geopolitical realities.@@@Three of its five permanent members are from the West.@@@They have no interest in changing the global status quo.@@@As a result, the Council is not fulfilling its function of maintaining international peace and security.@@@Only a more representative and democratic body can carry out that task.@@@Expanding the category of permanent membership in the Council to include major developing countries from Asia.@@@Africa and Latin America is therefore an imperative of our times.@@@We are pleased that China and Russia support such a reform of the Council, as they have repeatedly said.@@@We call on the other three permanent members of the Security Council to acknowledge the new realities and to agree to enshrine them in a reformed body.@@@As long ago as 2017.@@@President Alexander Lukashenko of the Republic of Belarus proposed an initiative to launch a global security dialogue, in an attempt to prevent a negative spiral in global politics.@@@Unfortunately, some key players did not want to listen to that reasonable call.@@@As a result, the security architecture in Europe has suffered a serious setback.@@@But it is never too late to do the right thing.@@@If we all want to make life on the planet safer and better, as we constantly hear about from this rostrum, we have no choice but to engage in dialogue and negotiations.@@@The Head of State of Belarus has consistently stressed the importance of organizing such a dialogue in the spirit of the San Francisco Conference.@@@That Conference truly gave life to our Organization and brought hope for a better future for the entire world.@@@We need that same hope today, and we believe that the United Nations is the platform where that initiative can become a reality.@@@We believe that the international conference on the topic “Eurasian security: reality and prospects” that Belarus will hold in Minsk on 26 and 27 October is one such contribution to the global dialogue process.@@@I should not fail to mention the subject of the conflict in our neighbouring country of Ukraine.@@@It has been very painful for us to watch how people close to us have been suffering for a year and a half.@@@Unfortunately.@@@Ukraine and its people have become a bargaining chip in the West’s great game aimed at preserving its global hegemony.@@@It is clear that by increasing its supply of arms to Ukraine, the West is determined to continue fighting the war to the last Ukrainian.@@@But does Ukraine want that?@@@Do Ukrainians need a war of 
attrition?@@@We do not believe that.@@@For its part.@@@Belarus has always supported peace in our neighbour Ukraine and has taken every possible step in that regard.@@@As the President of our country.@@@Alexander Lukashenko, has said, we are still ready to do everything in our power to achieve that end.@@@I would like to express my heartfelt condolences to the people of the Kingdom of Morocco and the Republic of Libya who lost their loved ones in the recent natural calamities.@@@South Sudan stands in solidarity with them during this difficult moment in their respective countries.@@@On behalf of the people and the Government of the Republic of South Sudan.@@@I stand here today to reaffirm our commitment to world peace and security.@@@We are committed to global efforts aimed at addressing the challenges that we face as a human family.@@@We are also committed to multilateralism and international cooperation as the best means of achieving our shared aspirations.@@@Within that context, we are hopeful that, together, we can rebuild trust among Member States and reignite global solidarity on the basis of the sovereign equality of all States, as enshrined in the founding Charter of the United Nations.@@@We recognize the urgency of the challenges before us.@@@We are also aware of the concerted action required to address those challenges in order to ensure a better future for the coming generation.@@@To that effect.@@@South Sudan has developed a Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) rescue plan, with a focus on seven SDG targets.@@@The plan provides a road map for a better future for our people.@@@Given that education is the key that will allow us to achieve other SDGs rapidly.@@@I am pleased to report that South Sudan has made some progress in its education sector since gaining our independence in 2011.@@@Our Constitution, for example, guarantees all children free access to education.@@@We have also designated education as a human right of every child.@@@In February.@@@I directed the Ministry of Education to implement a free primary and secondary education policy across the country.@@@The policy has directly led to the enrolment of 2.3 million children in our schools.@@@To ensure that girls stay in schools, we have banned child marriages through an act of Parliament.@@@More important, we have increased the education budget with the goal of paying teachers a living wage.@@@In the health sector, we plan to dedicate resources towards providing affordable and standard heath care.@@@That will be done through a primary health care approach that is inclusive and cost effective.@@@On climate change.@@@South Sudan is dedicated to addressing its adverse impact.@@@We plan to prioritize sustainable land use, promote renewable energy and collaborate with international partners to reduce carbon emissions and protect our environment for generations to come.@@@While working on that, it is only fair for us to call upon developed countries to cut their emissions by 45 per cent and honour their pledges to make funds available for mitigation, adaptation and loss and damage to the developing countries.@@@With the recently concluded Africa Climate Summit, held in Nairobi, it is high time that the declaration adopted at the Summit form the new basis for rebuilding trust and regaining global solidarity for attaining the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@We acknowledge the political, humanitarian and security challenges we have faced as a country since 2013.@@@However, we turned the corner with the signing of the Revitalized Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan in 2018.@@@Now we are determined to build on the commitments of our Revised National Development Strategy (2021- 2024) to consolidate peace and stabilize the economy.@@@The ongoing public financial management reforms and the recently concluded National Economic Conference form a solid basis for sound management of public resources for the benefit of our citizens.@@@What remains now is to fast-track the implementation of the remaining provisions of the agreement in order to conclude the transitional period peacefully through fair, transparent and credible elections in 2024.@@@We have also engaged in dialogue and consultation with various stakeholders, including civil society, women, youth, traditional leaders and opposition groups to ensure that our peace process is owned and driven by our people.@@@As we move in that direction, we call upon the United Nations to lift the arm embargo imposed on us to aid peace implementation and secure the elections.@@@The arms embargo has impeded the implementation of security arrangements because the effective deployment of the unified forces we have graduated cannot happen without arms.@@@As a country sharing a border with the Republic of Sudan.@@@South Sudan has received thousands of Sudanese refugees and returnees since the conflict broke out in the Sudan in April.@@@The influx has overwhelmed our border communities and created a humanitarian crisis.@@@I am appealing to the international community to make resources available to help refugees and displaced persons who have crossed into South Sudan.@@@While the world is dealing with multiple crises, we call for the provision of sustained support to those displaced persons as we work on how to restore peace and stability in the Sudan.@@@In conclusion.@@@South Sudan stands before the Assembly as a resolute partner in the collective pursuits of a better future for all.@@@I extent our hand of friendship to fellow Member States, international organizations and civil society.@@@As we enter the second decade of the twenty-first century, humankind faces inherited challenges and new obstacles that require action.@@@We must regard those calamities as opportunities that compel us to work together to overcome them.@@@The Dominican Republic is firmly committed to building a model of humane, inclusive, fair and sustainable development.@@@However, the question of whether we are really on track to achieve it is a valid one.@@@The various crises caused by climate change have had devastating impacts on our planet and our societies, such as droughts, rising sea levels, the loss of biodiversity and extreme weather events, among other impacts.@@@Those impacts have yielded an environmental liability that seriously imperils all the progress we have achieved in recent decades.@@@As a developing economy with a negative carbon footprint, we are making our contribution to climate change mitigation by encouraging the use of renewable energy.@@@But we know that is only one step on the long road to sustainability, because we are still very dependent on fossil fuels.@@@Oil remains important to us.@@@I take this opportunity to draw attention to the exporting countries’ practice of controlling supply to keep crude oil prices high, to the detriment of importing countries.@@@In the General Assembly, which is representative of all countries, we should discuss and approve a financial mechanism that guarantees the stability of crude oil prices for low-income and middle-income importing countries such as ours.@@@Important steps have been taken to address the climate emergency, such as the recent adoption of the Agreement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas beyond National Jurisdiction, which I will sign this afternoon.@@@Nevertheless, there are still many more important steps that must be taken, including the adoption of a multidimensional vulnerability index to be applied to all developing countries and the establishment of a loss and damage fund to provide financial assistance to the countries that are most vulnerable to the effects of climate change.@@@I would also like to highlight the International Conference on Small Island Developing States, to be held in Antigua and Barbuda in May 2024, in which our country will participate as a member of the preparatory committee.@@@It is also urgent to create a concessional financing mechanism to enable middle-income countries to meet the challenges of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@The lack of access to adequate resources was precisely one of the reasons that most countries failed to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.@@@As the Secretary-General has stated, the international financial system is broken.@@@The Dominican Republic firmly believes in a profound reform of the international financial architecture that benefits all countries in an equitable manner.@@@Another of the harmful effects of climate change affects our Caribbean region in particular is the massive bloom of sargassum.@@@That algae, which devours Caribbean coasts, including those of the United States 
and Mexico, has very serious economic, social and environmental impacts, especially for tourism, which accounts for up to 75 per cent of the economies of some Caribbean countries.@@@The Dominican Republic has created a multi-sectoral round table to deal with that problem, and we hope that developed countries will contribute to the solution.@@@One of the pillars of our commitment to achieve a fairer social contract and a more effective State has been, and will always be, the fight against corruption.@@@The Dominican citizenry has assumed it as a response to one of its main demands.@@@The various international indicators on the perception of corruption confirm the progress that my Government has made in that regard.@@@On another matter.@@@I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate to the Assembly the candidacy of the Dominican Republic to the Human Rights Council elections to be held next month for the period 2024- 2026.@@@Our candidacy represents our firm commitment to defending human rights.@@@When observing the island of Hispaniola from space — which can be done from a cell phone using Google Earth — a palpable and heartbreaking difference can be seen: a green and flourishing half that is the Dominican Republic, which has prioritized the conservation and sustainable management of its natural resources.@@@The other half, devoid of that rich forest cover, reflects Haiti’s dramatically deforested landscape.@@@That natural boundary is not only a geography lesson but also a powerful reminder of what awaits the world if we continue to ignore nature’s alarms.@@@Haiti today is suffering from not only an environmental tragedy but also political and social instability that could become a threat to the entire region.@@@I am not happy to recall the call I made two years ago to the General Assembly, when I said:
“Since we took office, we have warned repeatedly that the situation in Haiti could potentially spill over its borders and lead to insecurity in the region.@@@That is why this community of nations must urgently, once and for all, attend to the Haitian crisis as one of its highest priorities, requiring ongoing followup”.@@@(A/76/PV.9, p.3)
Today, two years later, the harsh reality of that warning can be confirmed.@@@A small group of Haitian private individuals has resumed construction of an illegal diversion channel in Haitian territory to extract water from the Dajabon River, in violation of border treaties between the Dominican Republic and Haiti.@@@The international community should know that the Dajabon River originates in Loma de Cabrera and that most of its 55 kilometres run through our territory until it flows into Manzanillo Bay in Montecristi.@@@Only two kilometres enter Haitian territory, and that small stretch on the Haitian side is where they are building the canal.@@@The information available to us indicates that it is a gambit by a small economic and political elite to control water in order to profit from its sale to smallholder farmers in the area.@@@The idea for that project was never officially communicated to the Dominican Government, and no documentation was provided on its scope, environmental impact or the identity of its final beneficiaries.@@@Despite the limited information available, the analyses we have carried out show that the project jeopardizes access to water for hundreds of Dominican and Haitian farming families downstream from where the canal is being built.@@@In addition, the project creates a flooding hazard for the CODEVI industrial park.@@@300 metres downstream of the canal, and its 19.000 Haitian workers, along with some of the inhabitants of the border towns of Dajabon and Juana Mendez.@@@And as if that were not enough, it could have harmful ecological effects on the Saladillo Lagoon, one of the main wetlands of the Dominican Republic.@@@Since April 2021, our Government has repeatedly requested the Haitian authorities to halt the unilateral and illegal construction of that project.@@@The Haitian Government has itself acknowledged that it is not a Government project but has failed to stop it, owing to the institutional weakness and the crisis of public order and security in that country.@@@The situation has already led to heightened animosity on both sides of the border.@@@Faced with that illegal international act committed by private individuals in a part of the river that is in Haitian territory, the Dominican Government has been forced to take strong measures, including closing the border with Haiti, in order to guarantee security and the national interest, as well as to protect our rivers, environment and agricultural production.@@@We are not having and do not desire or seek a confrontation with the Haitian people, but we do confront the uncontrollable actors who maintain insecurity in Haiti in the service of their private interests, who are now also conspiring against the stability of their Government and the security of water resources. 
Undoubtedly.@@@Haiti’s problem is no longer in Haiti; it is in the hands of the international community.@@@For that reason, we strongly support the responsible position expressed by the President Joe Biden of the United States yesterday from this very rostrum, a position we now repeat: the Security Council must urgently authorize the United Nations-backed security support mission.@@@The Security Council has already adopted three important resolutions — establishing a sanctions regime, an initiative to stop the illicit flow of arms and a call for the establishment of a multinational force to assist the Haitian National Police, as requested by that country’s Government and the Secretary-General of the Organization.@@@We applaud Kenya’s important gesture of solidarity in leading the multinational force, and that of Jamaica and the Bahamas in contributing troops.@@@I take this opportunity to thank in particular President William Ruto of Kenya for his solidarity and humanitarian willingness to lead, through this mission, the quest for peace and stability for the Haitian people.@@@In addition, we hope that all countries that are considering playing a role in that commendable effort will act with determination.@@@What is happening in Haiti is a breakdown of law and order by criminal elements, devoid of any political or ideological claims.@@@Accepting the request for assistance from the Haitian authorities by deploying a multinational force is therefore consistent with the letter and spirit of the Charter of the United Nations and the mandate of the Organization, in accordance with international law, to ensure peace.@@@We are all aware that the peacemaking process in Haiti must be undertaken in conjunction with a social and political covenant.@@@In that regard, we commend the noble efforts of the Caribbean Community Eminent Persons Group to broker a political agreement that will confer the greatest possible legitimacy to the acceptance of a multinational force and the holding of fair, free and transparent elections.@@@In that regard.@@@I would like to acknowledge Prime Minister Andrew Holness of Jamaica for all his efforts.@@@I would also like to thank the Secretary-General for his work in addressing that crisis and to call upon him to redouble his efforts to bring about the immediate deployment of a multinational force in Haiti.@@@We also call on the Security Council to adopt such a draft resolution now, because time has run out.@@@During centuries of often difficult coexistence with the Haitian people, the Dominican Republic has given clear demonstrations of tireless solidarity.@@@Haiti is in need of a great deal.@@@I want to reiterate our solidarity with the Haitian people, but I do so without forgetting that our main responsibility is to defend the interests of the Dominican people.@@@That is what we have always done, it is what we are doing, and rest assured it is what we will continue to do, because there is not and never will be a Dominican solution to the Haitian problem.@@@Let us not wait until the next warning turns out to be the chronicle of a tragedy foretold.@@@May this moment, at the seventy-eighth regular session of the General Assembly, mark a renaissance in our collective determination to forge a safer, more inclusive and more sustainable future for Haiti and for all.@@@I am making a final call.@@@This global forum challenges us to act not only as individual nations but as a united collective, with a shared vision and a common purpose.@@@History will judge us not only by the words we utter in these hallowed halls but — more crucially — by our actions in the real world.@@@Let us not fail the future.@@@It is my honour and privilege to address this Hall for the first time as Deputy Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea and on behalf of my Prime Minister, the Honourable James Marape, and the Government and the people of Papua New Guinea.@@@I congratulate the President of the General Assembly and the Government and the people of Trinidad and Tobago on his successful election to preside over the General Assembly’s work at its seventy-eighth session.@@@With his extensive diplomatic experience and the unique perspective of a fellow small island developing State, his chosen theme of peace, prosperity, progress and sustainability, with multilateralism at its core, resonates well with us.@@@I wish him well in carrying out his mandate and assure him of our full support.@@@I would also like to thank his predecessor.@@@His Excellency Mr. Csaba Korosi, for ably leading our collective work over the previous year in a challenging environment.@@@We wish him well in his future endeavours.@@@Let me also extend our appreciation to the Secretary-General for his strategic foresight and dynamic and action-oriented leadership to shape a better, peaceful, prosperous and shared future for humankind and the planet through the primacy of multilateral cooperation at the United Nations.@@@Today we meet against the global backdrop of development indices at the national and international levels that all point in the wrong direction, and the road ahead is not easy for all of us.@@@That therefore requires our individual and collective partnerships for our people, prosperity and planet.@@@For Papua New Guinea, we continue to face a daunting situation vis-a-vis building back better in the aftermath of the coronavirus disease pandemic.@@@That is compounded by the worsening climate crisis, the adverse socioeconomic and supply-chain-related impacts of the unacceptable war waged against Ukraine, the financial and economic burdens arising from the existing unfair and archaic international financial system and our own domestic challenges, which include economic growth, debt sustainability, meeting our people’s basic needs and providing social protection.@@@However, we are encouraged by the world coming together here to discuss and explore opportunities and solutions to surmount our shared development challenges.@@@Mere rhetorical talkfests and hollow sounding promises are what we must avoid.@@@Rather, let us use this opportunity to ensure that we put in place concrete, results-oriented and workable ways and means that will enable us to meet our citizens’ basic needs in an effective, timely and sustained manner and achieve our countries’ development aspirations while protecting our environment.@@@My Government has decided to take bold, decisive and pragmatic leadership and ownership in order to address our own development challenges head-on in critical areas such as economic growth, health services, education, the law and justice sector and infrastructure, including information and communications technology for e-Government.@@@We have also taken such an approach to dealing with external shocks to our country and our people.@@@Those issues are now being addressed through Papua New Guinea’s new five-year Medium- Term Development Plan Four for 2023-2027, which we launched in July, with a theme of national prosperity through growing the economy and 12 strategic priority areas of focus for our national development.@@@The plan also clearly identifies the measures, including funding, that will be needed to attain our development priorities and aspirations.@@@We are embarking on growing our economy from its current level of $31 billion per year to $57 billion by 2030, and we aim to create an additional 1 million jobs countrywide.@@@That will be catalysed by the diversification of our economy from the non-renewable energy sector, which is driven by mining, oil and gas, to complementary support from the renewables sector, including agriculture, fisheries, the service sector and concrete support for our small and medium-sized enterprises in the informal and formal sectors.@@@It will also entail providing the necessary infrastructure, together with investment in education and health and special economic zones, with incentives for productive investment, to propel our country forward.@@@The national development plan, together with our overall long-term Vision 2050 strategic development road map, serve as the cornerstone for the future we want.@@@They will deliver for us on improving our people’s quality of life, enhancing the country’s prosperity, peace and security and promoting better environmental protection and climate change mitigation and adaptation, in addition to enabling Papua New Guinea to become an upper-middle-income country by 2030 and to improve by 2050 our global ranking on the Human Development Index.@@@Our Medium-Term Development Plan Four also integrates and reaffirms my country’s strong commitment to accelerating and delivering on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which currently remains a serious concern for us because of the domestic impact of multiple global crises and our own national challenges.@@@We are determined to ensure that our new development road map is a springboard for the progressive implementation of the 2030 Agenda in a more comprehensive, focused, resourceful and accountable manner.@@@Papua New Guinea has prioritized health as a core national development agenda, as spelled out in our new fourth Medium-Term Development Plan and the National Health Plan for 2021 to 2030, supported by relevant policies.@@@It underlines our commitment to universal health coverage and quality and affordable health care, by focusing on people and their environment, engaging with social partners and sectors and increasing access to quality and affordable health services.@@@That reaffirmed commitment followed our 2020 national review of the health-care system, which highlighted the need for the review and reform of policies and laws on health issues in the country and for a stronger health system in order to meet our people’s basic health needs and achieve universal health coverage by 2030.@@@The review also underscored the importance of a multi-stakeholder approach for strengthening existing partnerships and building new ones in order to mobilize resources, appropriate technologies and financial support, including capacity-building and training opportunities, with a view to delivering the health outcomes we need for our people and our country, as well as the necessity of ensuring effective governance and accountability in the health sector, including transparency and proper oversight in procurement procedures and processes and delivery mechanisms, which are vital for eliminating overhead costs and malpractice in the health sector.@@@We continue to face major health-care-related challenges in the prevention and control of communicable and noncommunicable diseases, and in the area of reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health.@@@Tuberculosis also remains a serious concern in our country, and we have continued to witness increasing lifestyle- and cancer-related deaths in recent years.@@@However, the health review and reforms and strategic privatization have made positive impacts, including by transforming our national health system and focusing on training more medical staff, including doctors and nurses.@@@However, much more work remains to be done.@@@We therefore welcome development partnership in the health sector, which is crucial for us given our limitations in terms of health-related experts and institutional and systemic capacity and resources.@@@Those limitations continue to hinder the effective delivery of health care and services to our people, especially the rural majority.@@@We look forward to harnessing the outcomes of the three health-related high-level meetings that just concluded in order to support our recovery from the pandemic and to deliver on Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3 in the country.@@@The importance of partnerships for national development, including on the SDGs — especially in a challenging global situation such as the one we face today — cannot be overstated.@@@We therefore welcome genuine and durable partnerships from all stakeholders at all levels in supporting our development priorities and aspirations, including for the SDGs.@@@In our view, however, development partnerships should be on a basis of equality, instead of being approached through a donor-recipient lens that undervalues the contributions of recipient countries.@@@That will help build trust and confidence and enhance effective development partnership.@@@For Papua New Guinea, strategic development partnership is recognized in pillar 12 of our new Medium-Term Development Plan Four.@@@We call on all our development partners to ensure that their official development assistance to Papua New Guinea is 
aligned, under that framework, with the priorities set out in our own national development agenda, thereby averting unnecessary parallel efforts, and we call for cost-effective partnerships so that mutually beneficial outcomes may be achieved.@@@Let me also use this occasion to acknowledge and thank all our valued development partners for their constructive partnerships and support for my country’s development efforts.@@@We look forward to further strengthening our cooperative relations going forward.@@@Financing for development remains a serious challenge for us, as it is for many other developing countries, including in the aftermath of the pandemic.@@@The growing divide between countries that can access affordable financing for development and those that cannot is a serious concern that must be addressed swiftly, if we are genuine about leaving no one behind.@@@We also note the outcomes of the high-level meeting on financing for development and the SDG Summit, held at the level of Heads of State and Government earlier this week, and we strongly support the Secretary- General’s call for a $500 billion annual SDG stimulus to support developing countries.@@@That call is most timely and relevant, given the challenging development circumstances that the world currently faces.@@@If realized, gaining access to such funding support for developing States should be at speed, at scale and less onerous.@@@My country will need approximately $26 billion over the next five years in order to grow our national economy to reach our development aspiration of an annual economy of $57 billion, taking us progressively into the future and enabling us to deliver on our SDG commitment.@@@According to the International Monetary Fund and other pundits.@@@Papua New Guinea is rated as a high debt risk given our debt-to - gross-domestic-product (GDP) ratio.@@@We recognize that concern, but we need to fund our development framework and its effective implementation in order to cater to the demands of our growing population.@@@We are taking on the leadership and ownership of our domestic-resource mobilization, including financing our development priorities, through measures such as tax reform and enhanced internal revenue collection; strengthening governance laws and policies to halt illicit financial flows; addressing systemic issues regarding foreign exchange; reviewing and revising our domestic laws and policies to ensure that our natural-resources development in the extractive industry is on fair, just and equitable terms; incentivizing public-private partnerships and supporting small and medium-sized enterprises in the informal and formal sectors.@@@That has enabled us to provide our core funding for development, complemented by a small fraction of external financial support from our development partners.@@@We are also working with the International Monetary Fund and other bilateral development partners to move from a deficit budget to a more balanced one in order to cushion the impact of debt servicing on the delivery of our development needs.@@@We must ensure that the financial resources needed to advance our national development agenda, including for the SDGs, are accessible, affordable and delivered on a sustained, predictable basis for countries to access.@@@We also welcome development financing partnerships through debt-for-nature swaps as an important tool for addressing our debt issues while conserving our natural ecosystems.@@@We cannot afford to sacrifice our peoples’ development needs by merely conserving our natural resources without appropriate incentives to cater to their needs.@@@Let me also underscore that it is not enough to demand that countries fix their domestic systems to support their development financing.@@@It is also crucial that we effectively and urgently address the existing shortcomings of the international financial system that continue to be a bane of the financing-for-development needs of developing countries like my own.@@@We therefore join other countries and the Secretary-General in calling for urgent and comprehensive reform of the international financial architecture in order to address the economic and financial challenges facing developing nations, especially small island developing States like Papua New Guinea.@@@We further call on the international financial institutions and development partners to use the final report and recommendations of the High-Level Panel on the Multidimensional Vulnerability Index as a tool to take adequate account in their decision-making of the key factors of vulnerability, such as the adverse effects of climate change and natural disasters, rather than relying on GDP or gross national income per capita as the sole measure of a country’s development.@@@We also strongly support the Bridgetown Initiative 2.0 as part of reforming the global financial system in order to improve the response to the climate crisis and specific development challenges, including access to affordable financing and debt relief.@@@One of my country’s ongoing concerns in the context of financing for development is about the unintended consequences arising from anti-money-laundering laws.@@@For a small economy that is primarily rural and cash-based, such laws impede development growth in my country.@@@We need to ensure that the application of one-size-fits-all money-laundering laws does not continue to be a hindrance to the economic growth and sustainable development of small developing countries such as my own.@@@However, that does not imply a derogation of our duties in upholding the rule of law but rather the importance of ensuring that the financing we need for our national development does not become a victim of such laws.@@@The ongoing extreme and increasingly tragic weather and slow-onset events that have multiplied across the world — which the Secretary-General has aptly described as the era of global boiling — have emphasized the critical need for all of us to confront and address the climate crisis swiftly.@@@From our highland regions to the coastal lowlands and offshore areas in our island communities, the ravages of the climate crisis — as seen in natural disasters, droughts, sea level rise and food insecurity and their impact on our economy — have continued unabated, despite our negligible greenhouse-gas emissions.@@@That provided a backdrop to my country’s own second national climate summit, held last week in our capital with our development partners, on what we must do going forward, nationally and with other stakeholders.@@@We applaud the Secretary-General’s strong and dedicated leadership on climate change, including at the Climate Ambition Summit held earlier this week.@@@We also commend the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, the incoming and outgoing Chairs of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, on the ministerial meeting held on loss and damage, and we look forward to further engaging on that at COP 28.
Let me reiterate that Papua New Guinea’s position, like that of many of our fellow Pacific island countries, is that climate change is a key priority for us, as it remains the single greatest existential threat to the lives, livelihoods, security and well-being of our people.@@@The critical importance and urgency of limiting global warming to 1.5°C through rapid, deep and sustained reductions in greenhouse-gas emissions cannot be overstated.@@@It is critical to the survival of our smaller island nations in the Pacific.@@@That is why Papua New Guinea strongly supported the Assembly’s adoption in March of its landmark resolution 77/276, submitted by our Melanesian neighbour.@@@Vanuatu, on an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice on climate change, and we look forward to its outcome.@@@As home to 7 per cent of the world’s biodiversity.@@@Papua New Guinea has an important role in conserving it, and our evolving national plans, policies, legislation and partnerships on climate change underscore that strong commitment.@@@Again, that is reflected in our new fourth Medium-Term Development Plan and our strategic priority area 10 on climate change and the protection of the natural environment.@@@Papua New Guinea is indeed pleased to note that we have made much progress nationally on the climate-change front, which we take pride in, given our efforts to implement our targets under our nationally determined contributions so far.@@@At the Climate Ambition Summit.@@@Papua New Guinea announced its national commitments towards the 1.5°C global temperature goal and for climate justice.@@@In brief, those included our milestone achievement in June 2022 of our 2050 net-zero target; the completion and launching earlier this year of our 2022-2030 national adaptation plan on climate-resilient agriculture, infrastructure and transport and health-sector responsiveness to climate-sensitive diseases; and our political commitments to using our marine and terrestrial natural resources to address climate change, including for a just transition to renewable energy.@@@We therefore call once again call, first, on high- carbon-emitting States and developed economies to do much better.@@@Secondly, developed countries must urgently deliver on their climate-finance commitment of $100 billion per year and ensure that the distribution of those funds is equitable, accessible and timely.@@@Thirdly, we urge international financial institutions and development partners, including the Green Climate Fund, to ensure that countries like mine have timely access to climate finance for mitigation, adaptation and loss and damage in order to accomplish a just transition and ensure resilience to the effects of climate change.@@@Fourthly, we welcome international support for investments in the downstream processing of our natural resources, with a view to making the transformation we need in order to further support our enhanced climate ambition to achieve the global temperature goal and climate justice.@@@At the Pacific regional level.@@@Papua New Guinea urges the international community to contribute to the Pacific Resilience Facility — a regional financing facility set up to address disasters and climate-change threats on our Blue Pacific continent — and thanks our development partners who have contributed to it.@@@As a maritime nation.@@@Papua New Guinea’s commitment to protecting and sustainably using the oceans and seas and their resources remains steadfast.@@@Our fourth Medium-Term Development Plan, under strategic priority area 10, on climate change and protection of the natural environment, underscores that point.@@@Not only does the ocean serve as a vital carbon sink, but it is also our main source of economic benefits, revenue generation and daily sustenance, providing food and income for our people and communities.@@@As an example, our waters supply 18 per cent of the global tuna catch and 15 per cent of the global tuna trade.@@@We therefore strongly supported and welcomed the milestone adoption in June this year of the new global Agreement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction (BBNJ).@@@We are pleased to have contributed to ensuring that areas important to us — such as high-seas pockets, extended continental shelves, rights to fisheries, capacity-building and the transfer of marine technology — were covered in the treaty.@@@The BBNJ treaty also complements our own national protected areas and ocean policies, as well as our regional 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent.@@@We thank Singapore for its strategic and able leadership in presiding over the process, and we also commend the international community for rallying to support the BBNJ treaty after nearly two decades of intensive negotiations.@@@We look forward to its early implementation and are therefore encouraged and impressed by the high number of countries that signed the treaty four days ago at the United Nations treaty event.@@@We commend and congratulate them.@@@Papua New Guinea will sign the new BBNJ treaty once our domestic procedural and legal processes are completed.@@@Papua New Guinea supports the convening of the next United Nations Ocean Conference, on SDG 14, to be led by France and Costa Rica.@@@We are also supportive of the global efforts for a new binding global instrument on plastic pollution to further protect our marine ecosystem and will do our part to ensure its successful conclusion and eventual implementation.@@@And as an integral part of our stewardship of the ocean and seas.@@@16 days ago my Government hosted the eighth biennial Pacific Tuna Forum, with the support of our fellow Pacific countries, regional and subregional organizations, the private sector and academia.@@@We discussed the current status of the tuna industry and its sustainability in our region.@@@Like many other small island developing States.@@@Papua New Guinea is increasingly concerned about the rise in sea levels related to climate change.@@@Sea level rise is threatening not only the lives and livelihoods of our coastal communities and the country’s land territories, with consequent economic and other losses, but more fundamentally, the human rights of those of our people who are affected by it.@@@The existing international law does not address that serious concern.@@@We welcome the ongoing important work of the International Law Commission on the issue, to which we are committed to contributing further.@@@In view of that.@@@Papua New Guinea, together with our fellow members of the Pacific Islands Forum, is advancing efforts for another landmark Forum leaders’ declaration on statehood and the protection of people in the face of climate -change -related sea level rise.@@@We look forward to our Forum leaders’ adoption of it later this year.@@@We call on our development partners to work closely with us in equal partnership to further strengthen the protection and sustainable use of the ocean and seas.@@@At a time of challenging global and national circumstances, and given the evolving multiple crises everywhere, the protection and promotion of human rights, particularly for women and girls and those in vulnerable situations, must remain central for the international community.@@@Papua New Guinea has a strong commitment to that important issue, which we demonstrated most recently in strategic priority area 11 of our fourth Medium-Term Development Plan, on population, youth and women’s empowerment.@@@It demands that we increase the gender parity index for women in education, employment and business, combat incidents of gender-based violence and quadruple the number of women in leadership.@@@Those priority activities will require an investment of approximately $50 million to deliver the much-needed results by 2027.@@@We are also continuing to work through our bipartisan parliamentary committee on gender-based violence, led by seven members of Parliament with the welcome and valuable support and partnership of the European Union and the United Nations system, particularly UN-Women, the United Nations Population Fund and the United Nations Development Programme under the Spotlight Initiative, which was launched in March 2020.@@@Through an evidence-based approach, it addresses the unequal power relations between men and women with a focus on gender equality and women’s empowerment.@@@We have made good progress in areas such as reforming laws and policies and the justice system; health- and community-sector services; policing, medical and socio-psychological services; accessible legal support services; and shelters for the survivors of gender-based violence.@@@However, much more remains to be done, and we are committed to doing our part going forward.@@@We are also working with the United Nations human rights treaty bodies on our outstanding report on the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.@@@We thank our development partners in those efforts and urge others to join us in strengthening human rights in general and the rights of our women and girls more specifically.@@@The urgency of the need for a New Agenda for Peace, as called for by the Secretary-General in Our Common Agenda (A/75/982), is timely, and its importance for world peace and security cannot be overstated.@@@Papua New Guinea strongly supports the Secretary-General’s call, given the sobering and increasingly worrisome disrespect that some States have shown for international law, including the Charter of the United Nations; the geopolitical tensions and divides; simmering and unresolved conflicts and associated human rights violations; escalating nuclear-weapon threats; and mistrust between and within countries.@@@Without peace and security, our development aspirations under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and our respective development frameworks will be that much more difficult to achieve.@@@That is a recipe for a catastrophic outcome that none of us want.@@@Never again must we repeat the horrors of the two world wars.@@@We are seriously concerned about moves by certain countries towards the use of nuclear weapons.@@@Such threats are unacceptable and to be condemned in the strongest possible terms.@@@It is incumbent on us all to rally together in peaceful dialogue and in our common humanity, under the banner of the United Nations, to responsibly address all of those issues.@@@For my country, peace and security issues are a priority that is addressed through the law-and-justice sector of our Medium-Term Development Plan in strategic priority areas 5 and 6.@@@Our strong commitment to peace and security has enabled us to increase funding and investment for capacity-building and training in this sector.@@@For us, our founding foreign policy of being a friend to all and an enemy of none continues to guide us in the conduct of our foreign relations.@@@Economic, trade and friendly relations with all countries are in our national interest.@@@We are not interested in taking sides.@@@Papua New Guinea has also learned the importance of peace by peaceful means from its own internal situations.@@@It is in that spirit that we continue to engage in our Bougainville peace process, which remains a high priority for our country.@@@It continues to be addressed within the parameters of our Constitution and the mutually agreed road map for the peace process, which is capable of delivering peaceful and lasting political solutions for us.@@@We are grateful for the United Nations system’s continuing valuable and constructive support, including through the Secretary-General’s Peace-building Fund and other development partners, to the Bougainville peace process and the new initiatives in two other parts of our country.@@@With regard to reform of the United Nations, we are supportive of efforts towards meaningful reform, such as the revitalization of the General Assembly and the intergovernmental negotiations process for reforming the Security Council, in order to address today’s realities and be more accountable for the greater good of all.@@@However, we cannot afford lengthy and inconclusive processes such as we have seen in the Security Council intergovernmental negotiations.@@@We must do much better.@@@Before I conclude, as a SIDS, we recognize the important efforts towards a SIDS-specific programme of action for the next decade and the convening of the fourth International Conference on SIDS in Antigua and Barbuda in May 2024.@@@We join other SIDS in calling on development partners and the international community for assistance, including with funding, to support SIDS in charting their path forward to resilient prosperity and the future we want.@@@Lastly.@@@I reaffirm Papua New Guinea’s commitment to doing its part in upholding the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations as a sovereign State equal to other nations.@@@May God bless all of us and the United Nations.@@@It is with immense pride that Belize offers its heartiest congratulations to Mr. Dennis Francis as a Caribbean Community (CARICOM) national unanimously elected to preside over the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session.@@@The theme for our general debate.@@@“Rebuilding trust and reigniting global solidarity: accelerating action on the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals towards peace, prosperity, progress and sustainability for all”, is timely.@@@When we act in good faith, when we respect the rule of law, when we embrace our responsibility to act in the common interest of humankind, when we foster unity for a larger purpose — we manifest those principles.@@@Trust and solidarity are foundational to multilateralism.@@@Regrettably, trust and solidarity are in diminishing supply at a time when the capacity of Planet Earth to sustain human life is in grave peril.@@@The 0.7 per cent official development assistance/ gross national income target first agreed in 1970 has never been met.@@@By one estimate, that failure has resulted in $6.5 trillion in undelivered aid to developing countries.@@@At the fifteenth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, developed countries committed to mobilizing $100 billion per year by 2020 for climate action.@@@That commitment has yet to be met.@@@Consequently.@@@$381.6 billion in public climate finance has been forgone.@@@The commitment made in 2015 in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda to phase out fossil-fuel subsidies has been completely ignored.@@@According to the International Monetary Fund, fossil-fuel subsidies surged to a record $7 trillion last year.@@@Despite its strident calls for respecting human rights, the Global North remains outside the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Their Families; deaths and the inhumane treatment of migrants at the southern borders of the Western world continue with impunity.@@@The hoarding of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccines by developed countries and their continuing refusal to waive intellectual property rights for such vaccines caused prolonged suffering in the developing world, with some countries still below global vaccine targets.@@@Mistrust is widespread.@@@Solemn promises are routinely broken.@@@Narrow nationalism and insularity have displaced global solidarity.@@@Indeed, the situation is critical.@@@Only 12 per cent of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are on track for achievement.@@@For the first time, the Human Development Index declined globally for two years in a row, placing greater burdens on the most vulnerable.@@@Poverty and food insecurity are rising.@@@Hunger is at levels not seen since 2005, a major regression.@@@High inflation has returned.@@@The global average temperatures for the last three months were the highest on record.@@@Yet the Group of 20 countries, which are responsible for 80 per cent of greenhouse-gas emissions, are failing in their duty to drastically curb their emissions.@@@Keeping the goal of 1.5°C alive is slipping from our grasp.@@@The development financing gap is widening, putting development out of reach for low-income and vulnerable countries.@@@Our Governments face a callous choice between Scylla and Charybdis, expensive debt payments or acquiring even more expensive debt to invest in development and resilience.@@@More than half of the world’s top 50 most climate-vulnerable countries are home to 40 per cent of people living in extreme poverty.@@@But as they represent only 2.5 per cent of the global economy, their debt distress falls through the global financial cracks.@@@Paradoxically, accompanying the progressive erosion of trust and solidarity is the inclination to further dig in, to deny the science, to dismiss the perspectives of others, to retreat into like-minded spaces and to stoke more division.@@@The spaces for dialogue and cooperation are closing.@@@Polarization and fragmentation are trending.@@@Too much is at stake: our existence and our prosperity, our way of life and our future.@@@In answer.@@@Belize proposes three broad actions that are urgent and necessary to restore trust and to foster solidarity.@@@We are living now with the tragic consequences of twentieth-century multilateral institutions and their governing mechanisms, which are ill-suited to the crises of the twenty-first century.@@@Urgent reform of the international financial architecture is imperative.@@@The objectives and policies of international financial institutions must be better aligned with our climate and development goals.@@@The eligibility criteria, which currently exclude some vulnerable countries from access to development finance, must be reformed to take account of vulnerabilities.@@@The governance of international financial institutions must be broadened to include the voices of developing countries.@@@Decisions for us cannot be made without us.@@@The upcoming annual meetings in Marrakech, the realization of the multilateral development banks vision emanating from the Paris Summit, the Bridgetown Initiative and the prototype multidimensional vulnerability index are all real reforms that would reinvigorate genuine trust in the international financial system.@@@We must all seize the day.@@@The events of the last decade have shown how ineffective the Security Council is and the dangerous vacuum that arises therefrom.@@@Threats to international peace and security demand an effective Council, one that is inclusive with equitable representation that reflects today’s global dynamics.@@@The inability of the Council to act in the face of the illegal Russian invasion and illegal Russian war against Ukraine exemplifies the Council’s impotence.@@@Reform of the current Council is urgent, and Belize calls for the commencement of text-based negotiations at this session.@@@Unmet commitments, insufficient to meet growing needs, have contributed to the huge financing gap we face today, to the stalling of the climate and development agendas and to the deepening of current crises.@@@By course-correcting immediately, we can begin to restore trust and solidarity and get us on track to achieving the Paris goals and the SDGs.@@@In truth, regrettably, we are all on the road to climate perdition — all of us; no one is exempt.@@@The global stocktake to be concluded at the twenty-eighth session 
of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP) is an unmissable opportunity to agree solutions to address the perilous gaps in implementation, accelerate climate action and ramp up ambition.@@@The just-concluded high-level political forum on sustainable development convened under the auspices of the General Assembly revealed the dire reality that we face.@@@The refusal of developed countries to, so far, raise the ambition on the means of implementation is disappointing.@@@That must change.@@@The fourth International Conference on Financing for Development is an important opportunity to forge a new financing pact for sustainable development.@@@While the implementation of the SDGs occurs at the local level, and Governments bear primary responsibility for national development, we should be clear: achieving the SDGs is the shared responsibility of all countries.@@@The SDGs are a bulwark against conflict and insecurity, the pull of migration and social instability.@@@Trust and solidarity can thrive only where there is justice.@@@The terrible injustice and the poisoned legacy of native genocide, slavery and the transatlantic slave trade cannot continue to be ignored or to be the subject only of academic discussions.@@@Descendants of slaves continue to struggle with persistent racial discrimination, marginalization and generational trauma.@@@The consequences of slavery for our countries manifest today through underdevelopment, poverty and structural inequities.@@@CARICOM has put forward a 10-point plan that addresses the core of reparatory justice as we see it.@@@Reparatory justice is essential to any redemption from a historical wrong that is so indelible that it can never be fully remedied but must be reckoned with.@@@To the Governments of the European countries that enabled that evil, we say that the time for redemption, respect and reparation is here, and we demand it.@@@The decades-long call for climate justice must be answered.@@@Small island developing States like Belize are the most vulnerable to climate change.@@@Our countries are reaching the limits of adaptive capacity and already incurring loss and damage, and will continue to do so.@@@Yet those whose economic prosperity and wealth have been based on climate-destroying activities are attempting to evade their historical responsibilities by lowering ambition on climate action, backsliding on the implementation of their obligations and refusing to deliver on climate finance.@@@That blatant injustice is compounded by the reality that to invest in resilience, to respond to and recover from climate-induced disasters, we must borrow from the very same wealthy countries.@@@Developed countries must urgently double adaptation financing and better align that financing with our growing needs.@@@They must close the emissions and implementation gaps to keep the 1.5°C goal within reach.@@@The loss and damage fund must be operationalized and capitalized at COP28.@@@We need adequate resources for just transitions to sustain our low-carbon economies and to further decouple our energy, transport and electrical systems from high-polluting activities.@@@Too many of our Member States continue to be oppressed by systematic but entirely repairable injustices.@@@The ambivalence of the international community and the United Nations itself in response to the desperate call from Haiti for assistance is unconscionable.@@@The Haitian people are suffering from unimaginable violence, human rights violations and a humanitarian disaster.@@@The CARICOM Eminent Persons Group is working to facilitate political consensus-building, which will be essential to Haiti’s recovery.@@@A broad-based political compact is urgently needed to transition to constitutional governance.@@@Belize commends the offer of Kenya to lead a multinational force to provide security assistance to Haiti.@@@Belize will join with other CARICOM countries in contributing to the multinational force once the appropriate framework is in place.@@@We call for the full funding of the Haiti humanitarian response plan and a strong Security Council resolution to support the mobilization of the multinational force.@@@Time flies.@@@Haiti can wait no longer.@@@Belize repeats its call for the immediate lifting of the illegal, immoral and unjust commercial, financial and economic blockade imposed on Cuba.@@@The designation of Cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism by the United States of America is evil and pernicious.@@@We deplore it, we condemn it, and we call for its immediate removal.@@@In the post-cold 
war dispensation, the American policy has no other objective but to cruelly punish ordinary Cubans and stifle their sustainable development aspirations.@@@Indeed, the increasing imposition of unilateral coercive measures against Venezuela and other developing countries is both illegal and a significant obstacle to development.@@@For more than half a century, the international community and the United Nations have failed to deliver a peaceful and secure State for the Palestinian people.@@@Consequently, the people of Palestine continue to suffer the indignities of illegal occupation and Israeli apartheid.@@@I reiterate Belize’s full support for the realization of an independent Palestinian State, within its 1967 borders, with all attendant rights, including the recognition of East Jerusalem as its capital and the right of return.@@@The continued exclusion of Taiwan from the international community is inconsistent with the realities of today’s world.@@@Taiwan is a vibrant, democratic country with the willingness and capacity to contribute to addressing global challenges.@@@Belize calls for Taiwan’s full inclusion in the international system.@@@Regrettably.@@@Russia’s war against Ukraine continues, with devastating effects, especially on civilians.@@@We condemn the attempts to redraw international borders by force.@@@That war must end.@@@The price is too high.@@@It is time for peace.@@@The international community must urgently right the wrongs unceasingly and unnecessarily perpetrated against those countries.@@@Doing so would serve immeasurably towards rebuilding trust and solidarity among our community of nations.@@@As Belize and Guatemala continue to pursue the peaceful, just and final resolution of Guatemala’s claim to Belizean territory before the International Court of Justice, illegal incursions by Guatemalans continue.@@@Recently.@@@Guatemalan military forces illegally entered Belizean waters and unlawfully removed Belizean flags placed on Belizean soil.@@@Deforestation, cattle ranching and the cultivation of illegal drugs by Guatemalans continue in remote and protected areas of Belize.@@@Those activities are contrary to international law and good- neighbourliness.@@@The conclusion of a Sarstoon Protocol to avoid unnecessary incidents in our southern and maritime space remains outstanding but necessary.@@@Solidarity originates from the Latin word solidum, meaning to hold a debt together.@@@All the States Members of the United Nations hold a debt together: a debt to one another, a debt to our planet, a debt to leave a better world for future generations.@@@By rebuilding trust and solidarity, we can advance the robust international cooperation that is indispensable for rescuing people and planet.@@@Let me close by quoting the father of our Belizean nation.@@@The Right Honourable George Price:
“Creation was not finished at the dawn of this Earth, but creation continues, and we have a lot to do to make the world a better place.”@@@I would like to congratulate the President on his election to lead the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session and to assure him of Guyana’s full support as he carries out his responsibilities.@@@I also want to take this opportunity to express our appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Csaba Korosi for his leadership as President of the Assembly at its seventy-seventh session.@@@And I join those who have spoken before me in expressing Guyana’s solidarity with the Governments and peoples of Libya and Morocco in the wake of the recent devastating flood and earthquake.@@@The theme of this year’s session recognizes the need for us to collectively reset our global relationships and imbue them with enhanced trust and solidarity.@@@Only through that can we hope to confront the most pressing challenges of our era — climate change, conflicts, the energy and food crises and the achievement of sustainable development.@@@I continue to believe that multilateralism remains the most effective approach to addressing those challenges, foremost of them climate change.@@@We are all experiencing its devastating effects.@@@The difference, however, is in our capacity to respond.@@@It is well established that those bearing the brunt of climate change have made no contribution to the current crisis.@@@Small island developing and low-lying coastal States such as Guyana are among the hardest hit and require adequate financing to address the attendant effects.@@@The commitments in that regard by developed countries, including the pledge of $100 billion per year, remain unfulfilled.@@@How much longer must developing countries wait for those commitments to be fully delivered on?@@@Although Guyana’s emission levels are already at net zero, we continue to pursue growth premised on a low-carbon development strategy.@@@Our goal is to ensure that we use our resources sustainably to foster inclusive and equitable development for our people.@@@As the country with the second-highest forest cover per capita in the world, we know the importance of forests in mitigating the effects of climate change at the global level.@@@Our advocacy in that regard has resulted in Guyana being issued 33.4 million tons of carbon credits — the first jurisdictional-scale programme in the world.@@@We have secured $750 million for the period from 2016 to 2030 so far.@@@Guyana is committed to a clean-energy transition, and we are aiming for more than 80 per cent reliance on renewable energy by 2030.@@@Technology, capacity and financing are key to developing countries’ ability to build a relevant energy mix and the necessary share of renewable energy.@@@We are using revenue from oil and gas resources to finance our transition to renewable energy, despite our already globally recognized net-zero status.@@@Let me expound on the critical question of a just, affordable and equitable transition.@@@Bloomberg estimates that achieving global net-zero emissions by 2050 requires annual investments of more than triple the 2021 level, to $6.7 trillion per year.@@@To limit the global temperature rise to less than 2°C, the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that investment in the energy sector alone will have to increase by approximately $1 trillion annually.@@@At the same time, in developing countries, the situation is more frightening, with close to 900 million people worldwide having no access to electricity.@@@All of that has to be seen against the backdrop of a widening financing gap in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, with adaptation alone estimated at between $160 billion and $340 billion by 2030, and between $315 billion and $565 billion by 2050, according to the United Nations Environment Programme.@@@More than 90 countries have committed to net-zero emissions.@@@If we are to achieve that, the IEA estimates that by 2050 more than 85 per cent of buildings must be net-zero-carbon-ready, more than 90 per cent of heavy industrial production must be low-emissions and almost 70 per cent of electricity will have to come from solar photovoltaic sources.@@@Based on those targets, the share of renewables in generating electricity will have to increase from 29 per cent in 2020 to 88 per cent by 2050.@@@Meanwhile, in order to remove carbon from the atmosphere, the world will need to simultaneously halt deforestation and double the rate of the increase in 
tree-cover gain by 2030.@@@That means that by 2050.@@@7.6 gigatons of carbon dioxide will have to be captured and stored, compared to 0.4 gigatons in 2020.@@@According to McKinsey & Company, it will cost $375 trillion in cumulative spending on physical assets to transition to net zero by 2050.@@@In the circumstances, the question is how realistic the transition path to net zero is.@@@It is clear that the global ambition of net zero by 2050 is not currently realistic, given the cost of transition and the financing commitments made so far.@@@I say all of that not to reduce ambition, but for us to honestly and frankly direct our energies to a more balanced approach to achieving net zero in a realistic environment.@@@My country.@@@Guyana, is blessed with the best of both worlds — that is, our ability to lead on climate change and to use our expansive oil and gas reserves can contribute to the advancement and development of our country and region.@@@But let me hasten to add that the twenty-eighth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP28) will not achieve the desired objectives of definitively putting our planet on a net-zero trajectory if we continue to address this matter in a doctrinarian way, ignoring the current realities.@@@Given the growth in demand for energy, a significant part of that demand will come from many in the developing world who continue to live in energy poverty.@@@It is also a fact that renewables will not meet the growth of demand in the near future.@@@If the debate at COP28 is framed by two camps — one calling for no cuts in fossil-fuel production, including its most polluting forms, such as coal, and the other saying that the only solution to net zero is an end to fossil fuel production — we will fail once again to achieve a viable outcome and give our world the energy it needs to grow and prosper.@@@I believe that net zero by 2050, as a target, can be achieved only by a combination of measures that include cuts in fossil-fuel production, incentivizing the introduction of renewables at scale, exploring advances in technology in using carbon capture and storage, curtailing deforestation and land degradation and introducing measures to curb demand for energy.@@@As custodians of a rainforest the size of England and Scotland combined, we are of the view that the lack of financing for standing forests suggests that they are worth more dead than alive.@@@That is why we support the expansion of financial mechanisms that appropriately value the environmental services provided by forests, including through the carbon market.@@@We are at the midpoint of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development — our global blueprint for sustainable and resilient development.@@@Financing is the cornerstone of all efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the challenges faced by developing countries, including the funding gaps, which I highlighted at the SDG Summit.@@@Commitments, including the commitment made 50 years ago to provide 0.7 per cent of gross national income in official development assistance, must be fulfilled.@@@The existing financial architecture is incapable of addressing current global challenges and must be reformed.@@@In that regard, the reform agenda must include the early adoption of a multidimensional vulnerability index that implements the measures contained in the Bridgetown Initiative and addresses liquidity support, private capital, development lending, trade and more inclusive governance of the international financial institutions.@@@The world is currently experiencing a global food crisis marked by soaring food prices, heightened food insecurity and increasing levels of hunger.@@@Conflict, climate change and the effects of the pandemic contribute to that dire state of affairs.@@@Approximately 119 million people in 26 least developed countries have faced severe food insecurity since the beginning of 2022.@@@Due to rising food prices and trade restrictions, the situation has worsened.@@@By 2030, it is estimated that nearly 670 million people, equivalent to 8 per cent of the global population, will suffer from undernourishment.@@@Global agrifood systems must be urgently transformed to ensure that they are more resilient and that nutritious food is affordable for all.@@@We also condemn the weaponization of food as an instrument of war.@@@Guyana welcomes the convening of the three high- level meetings on health and the important commitments contained in the respective political declarations.@@@But we must together move rapidly to implementation if we are to achieve universal health coverage for all and be adequately prepared for future pandemics.@@@Guyana has already made tremendous strides on a path to universal health coverage.@@@In doing so, we increased our per capita health spending by 64 per cent in the past three years.@@@Global peace is hinged on respect and human dignity.@@@Our work at all levels must advance the dignity and rights of every person on our planet in order to create 
a just, equitable and peaceful world.@@@We have noted that, since the war began in Ukraine more than one year ago, the developed world has provided approximately $220 billion in support to Ukraine, while the World Bank added more than $37.5 billion in emergency financing — a total of almost $260 billion mobilized in less than two years.@@@On the other hand, aid to the Palestinian people over a period of 26 years amounted to just over $40 billion, according to figures compiled by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).@@@Haiti has received just over $20 billion in aid for reconstruction and development over the past 60 years.@@@According to the OECD.@@@African countries were recipients of just over $113 billion over a three-ye ar period to fight hunger.@@@To be clear.@@@Guyana unequivocally supports the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity, as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, and remains in full solidarity with the people of Ukraine and what they justly require from the international community.@@@However.@@@I cannot overlook the disparity in the approach to other countries and regions of the world.@@@That must be corrected.@@@Clearly, that is a demonstration of an unjust ecosystem surrounding and supporting development financing, peace and security.@@@Importantly, it also proves that, if truly committed, mechanisms exist to unlock financing at scale.@@@Adherence to the rule of law, including international law, must continue to be the cornerstone of all our engagements.@@@That is being undermined by threats and naked acts of aggression against sovereign States and by the perpetuation of old conflicts and disputes among States.@@@The Russian invasion must end.@@@Greater diplomatic efforts must be made to bring an end to the war.@@@The ongoing crisis in Haiti is of grave concern.@@@Urgent and decisive action must be taken to secure a comprehensive solution.@@@I commend the offer of the Governments of Kenya and Rwanda to lead a multinational force in Haiti, as well as the offers by the Bahamas and Jamaica.@@@Guyana is committed to working closely with partners within the United Nations and Caribbean Community (CARICOM) frameworks to find a long-lasting, stable and sustainable solution to the Haitian crisis so that our Haitian brothers and sisters can live in peace and dignity.@@@The Republic of Cuba has been the object of aggression for more than six decades.@@@We repeat our call for the dismantling of the unacceptable embargo against our sister Caribbean State.@@@The economic and political aggression, along with the designation of Cuba as a State sponsor of terrorism, must come to an end.@@@I also reaffirm Guyana’s long-standing solidarity with the Palestinian people and support for their dignified existence in their homeland, in accordance with the two-State solution.@@@As States Members of the United Nations, let us do more to move past rhetoric so that the peace process can progress.@@@When I addressed the Organization of American States (OAS) last Friday.@@@I recalled to that hemispheric body how Guyana was excluded from the OAS for 25 years after its birth as a nation, on account of a spurious territorial claim to two thirds of our homeland by Venezuela.@@@But justice prevailed, and Guyana was ultimately admitted.@@@It is sad, however, that 57 years after Guyana’s independence, we remain threatened.@@@Venezuela’s efforts to undermine our freedom, sovereignty and territorial integrity are today before the International Court of Justice, as decided by the Secretary-General, under the Geneva Agreement of 1966.@@@The jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice in the matter has been twice affirmed by the Court.@@@We are confident that Guyana’s sovereignty and territorial integrity will also be affirmed when the Court issues its final judgment.@@@I regret to inform the Assembly that Venezuela’s threats continue.@@@Just last night.@@@Guyana received a very threatening message from Venezuela, in the form of a communique attacking Guyana for putting certain oil blocs in our sovereign waters up for bid.@@@Guyana considers that a threat to regional and international peace and security, as well as to Guyana’s investment partners.@@@We demand that Venezuela honour its obligation under the Charter to pursue only peaceful means to settle any disputes it may have with Guyana, including adjudication before the International Court of Justice.@@@Allowing the Court to decide would ensure a resolution that is peaceful, equitable and in accordance with international law.@@@Guyana will spare no effort in defending its sovereignty and territorial integrity.@@@I express appreciation to every member of the international community that has continued to support Guyana’s efforts to preserve its sovereignty and territorial integrity.@@@As Guyana takes its place next January as a member of the Security Council, those principles of international law and justice, so prominent in the Charter of the Organization, shall be our guide.@@@And I therefore 
express heartfelt gratitude for the overwhelming support of Member States for our candidature to the Security Council for the 2024—2025 term.@@@I wish to assure the entire United Nations membership that Guyana is committed to working with fellow Council members and the wider United Nations membership to fulfil the mandate of the Security Council.@@@As I reflect on the state of growing insecurity in the world, let me also reiterate the calls made by CARICOM for the early and urgent reform of the United Nations Security Council to make it more effective and inclusive.@@@September is the month dedicated to Indigenous people in my country.@@@We are aware that, globally, indigenous peoples are often left behind.@@@That is not the case in Guyana.@@@My Government is investing heavily in Indigenous peoples’ development, ensuring their inclusion and participation in decision-making at all levels.@@@Our land-titling programme has resulted in Indigenous peoples obtaining legal ownership of 16.4 per cent of Guyana’s land mass.@@@In addition to regular Government investment.@@@15 per cent of all proceeds from the sale of carbon credits go directly to Indigenous villages to finance their development.@@@Guyana is the first country to implement such an initiative.@@@We are proud of our record and stand ready to share our experiences.@@@Allow me to conclude by renewing Guyana’s solidarity with the peoples of the world, our commitment to multilateralism and our readiness to partner with States large and small in the quest for peace and prosperity for all.@@@I bring greetings from the people of Solomon Islands to this Hall.@@@We reaffirm our commitment to the principles of this 78-year-old Organization for a world of peace and shared prosperity, progress through partnership and a sustainable future with dignity and liberty.@@@The people of Solomon Islands extend our congratulations to a fellow islander from Trinidad and Tobago.@@@His Excellency Ambassador Dennis Francis, on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session.@@@We also acknowledge his predecessor.@@@His Excellency Ambassador Mr. Csaba Korosi, for his stewardship throughout the seventy-seventh session of the General Assembly.@@@I wish him every success in his future endeavours.@@@I too would like to join the international community in conveying, on behalf of the people of Solomon Islands, our deepest condolences to the Government and the people of the Kingdom of Morocco and Libya, respectively.@@@We pray for their speedy recovery and that the Almighty give strength and comfort to those who lost their loved ones, livelihoods and homes.@@@The choice of this year’s theme is very interesting given our current state of world affairs, and it is one that resonates well with Solomon Islands.@@@Eight years ago, in this very Hall, we made a pledge to save our planet, eradicate poverty and address the climate crisis (see A/70/PV.4).@@@Collectively, we resolved to adopt the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in our bid to ensure that no one is left behind.@@@The Paris Agreement on Climate Change is also a testament of that unified resolve.@@@However, today the health of our planet has declined, and poverty has increased.@@@We are also presented with a runaway climate crisis that threatens our very existence and questions our resolve.@@@Those multiple predicaments, coupled with the toxic mix of geopolitical power posturing, conflicts and economic downturn, have called into question our collective commitments to the very purpose of our Organization and the effectiveness of multilateralism in our fast changing world.@@@Taking stock of our achievements, it is unacceptable that 85 per cent of the global Sustainable Development Goal targets are either off track or stagnant or have regressed.@@@The gravity of that situation cannot be 
ignored, especially for least developed countries (LDCs) and small island developing States (SIDS).@@@The theme presented not only highlights the failure of multilateralism, but also raises the immediate need for us to restore our trust and reignite our solidarity by upholding our global commitment within the principles and spirit of the Charter of the United Nations.@@@The theme further presents an opportunity for us to take stock of our own shortcomings and to see where we can breathe new life into the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@If it means re-engineering our method of collaboration and raising our ambition to bolster and accelerate global action in the next seven years, then we must start today.@@@As an LDC, we are heartened by the international community’s support to extend our preparatory period to graduate from such a status to 2027.@@@We thank the international community for its solidarity and support.@@@Solomon Islands remains committed to having our smooth transition strategy in place by the end of 2024.@@@We are reviewing our 2016-2035 national development strategy, and we have prioritized infrastructure resilience, digital connectivity, technology transfer, investment, trade and energy reforms to ensure that our graduation is resilient, sustainable and irreversible.@@@That is our effort to salvage and re sene the 2030 Agenda.@@@To propel our economic recovery and build our resilience, we need bilateral and multilateral support to advance our development aspirations and address our vulnerabilities.@@@In that vein, we once again reiterate our call for an enhanced United Nations in-country presence.@@@We therefore call for the immediate implementation of the six priorities of the Doha Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries 2022-2031 and for translating those commitments into reality.@@@We also welcome the inclusion of Solomon Islands in the pilot phase of the early-warning systems through the resilience-building mechanism, and we look forward to the utilization of the sustainable graduation support facility to support our transition initiatives towards graduation.@@@The world’s commitment to multilateralism must be strengthened.@@@Solomon Islands calls for stronger political will from the “haves” to grant LDCs non-reciprocal trade arrangements and Generalized System of Preferences arrangements.@@@Good-neighbourly relations means caring and striving for all.@@@The 47 LDCs account for only 1 per cent of global trade.@@@We acknowledge and value South-@@@South cooperation because it is less restrictive and more responsive and is aligned to our national needs.@@@We applaud the People’s Republic of China for its initiative in accelerating the implementation of the 2030 Agenda through its Belt and Road Initiative, the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative.@@@During my discussions with President Xi Jinping in July.@@@Solomon Islands and China reached an understanding to establish a comprehensive strategic framework that aims to achieve our National Development Strategy 2016-2035 and the 2030 Agenda through those transformative initiatives.@@@Such initiatives carry significant importance in promoting, implementing and achieving the 2030 Agenda on the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@We call on all partners to adopt that transformative partnership model.@@@If we are to rebuild trust and reignite solidarity, then let us start by changing how we engage and by reforming our international financial architecture.@@@Our appetite for transformative change has never been higher, and we look forward to working closely with all partners that are genuine to partner with us in our path to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@I call for the establishment of a permanent seat for SIDS in the decision-making body within the international financial architecture to ensure inclusivity.@@@As a small island developing State, we support the fourth International Conference on Small Island Developing States, scheduled to be held in Antigua and Barbuda in May 2024.@@@The gathering is expected to present a road map of collective action to succeed the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action Pathway.@@@We have every confidence that that new partnership will be ambitious and will recommit global action to the unique and special needs of SIDS.@@@On the matter of the development of the multidimensional vulnerability index.@@@Solomon Islands supports the call for the adoption of the multidimensional vulnerability index and its implementation and operationalization during the seventy-eighth session of the General Assembly.@@@That is a SIDS initiative, which takes into account the cross-dimensional vulnerability of SIDS to recover and build back better.@@@Therefore, the modus operand!@@@of the international financial institutions must be reformed to address our special circumstances of vulnerability.@@@There can be no sustainable development without peace, and no peace without sustainable development.@@@The world cannot achieve the Sustainable Development Goals with all the conflict and wars that are going on.@@@The past seven years have shown us that.@@@Solomon Islands reiterates its call for the cessation of all conflict, including the Ukraine war.@@@We must restore faith in our Charter and give peace a chance.@@@We must better understand each other, listen to each other more and seek diplomatic solutions to all conflicts.@@@Wars have exacerbated our vulnerability, have broken our trust and undermine our solidarity.@@@It remains a great distraction from our development agenda.@@@Swords must now be converted into ploughs.@@@It is time that we sow seeds of peace so that we can reap the fruit of progress, prosperity and sustainability.@@@We continue to call for an expanded, democratic, equitable, transparent and accountable Security Council that represents today’s realities.@@@That includes a dedicated seat for small islands developing States.@@@Nine years ago.@@@Solomon Islands registered its interest in serving on the Security Council for the period from 2031 to 2032.@@@Today we continue to seek international support for our candidature, and we thank those that have given their support.@@@We again reiterate our strong belief in multilateralism and reaffirm our commitment to the spirit and purpose of the United Nations Charter.@@@Solomon Islands will host the 17th Pacific Games — the region’s largest and premium multi-sport event — for the first time in our history from 19 November to 2 December.@@@Our shores will be graced by the presence of more than 5.000 athletes from 24 countries and territories within the Pacific region, including Australia and New Zealand.@@@We stand united and proud to deliver on that regional commitment.@@@Solomon Islands is grateful and appreciates the ongoing support from our bilateral and multilateral partners, in particular the People’s Republic of China, which has become our leading infrastructure partner.@@@We also thank Saudi Arabia.@@@Australia.@@@New Zealand.@@@Indonesia.@@@Papua New Guinea, the Republic of Korea and Japan for their support.@@@Countless voices have echoed the same sentiment, namely, that climate change remains the single-greatest threat to our people and planet.@@@But have we seriously and truly taken heed?@@@The ambition under the Paris Agreement remains low.@@@We need to keep the 1.5°C target alive and close the mitigation gap.@@@The global stocktake under the Paris Agreement is critical to keeping everyone honest and knowing where we are, what we need to do and how to keep the 1.5°C goal alive.@@@The loss and damage mechanism needs to be resourced and operationalized.@@@Global trust needs to be restored to uphold the credibility of the Paris Agreement.@@@We must walk the talk by taking drastic climate action.@@@Solomon Islands welcomes the deliberations of the International Court of Justice on the Vanuatu initiative for climate change.@@@We must accelerate our transition to a low-carbon economy and further support the Port Vila initiative for a just transition from fossil fuels.@@@Developed countries must take the lead in financing the construction of climate-resilient safe islands in SIDS.@@@That must be a global priority.@@@Solomon Islands is pleased to inform the General Assembly that we ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.@@@The National Disability Inclusive Policy and the Mental Health Policy provide the implementation framework to ensure that the rights of persons with disabilities are promoted and protected at all levels.@@@We are cognizant of our duty to provide an enabling environment and mechanisms that enable our people to exercise their fundamental rights, as provided for under our Constitution.@@@Solomon Islands reaffirms the right to self-determination, as enshrined under the United Nations Charter.@@@On the question of New Caledonia and French Polynesia.@@@Solomon Islands notes with deep concern the credibility of the latest referendum in New Caledonia.@@@We urgently call on the relevant body and stakeholders to look into that matter.@@@Solomon Islands notes with deep concern the six- decade embargo imposed on Cuba.@@@That unilateral action undermines the spirit of multilateralism and Cuba’s progress towards achieving the 2030 Agenda.@@@We urge our friend and partner, the United States of America, to lift the unjust economic embargo placed on Cuba.@@@That is an opportunity to rebuild trust and reignite solidarity.@@@Embargoes do not augur well with the resolve of this organ to leave no one behind.@@@On behalf of the people of Solomon Islands.@@@I take this opportunity to thank Cuba for the support to our health sector through the training of our medical doctors in recent years.@@@Two days ago.@@@Solomon Islands became one of the first signatories to the agreement on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction, a subsidiary to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.@@@In collaboration with the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries 
Agency.@@@Solomon Islands will host a summit on the implementation of SDG 14.4 in Honiara next year.@@@That will be done in coordination with the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for the Ocean.@@@The summit will showcase Pacific leadership in tuna fisheries management.@@@The outcome will feed into the third United Nations Ocean Conference, to be held in June 2025.@@@We note the ongoing work of the current intergovernmental negotiating committee to develop an international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution, including in the marine environment.@@@That is critical to maintaining the health, productivity and resilience of our ocean and is in line with 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent.@@@The Pacific had been a victim of power politics long before we became a member of this Organization.@@@The Battle of Guadalcanal is recorded in history as one of the fiercest battles of the Second World War, a war that was not of our making.@@@The lack of urgency eight decades ago to remove the unexploded ordnance (UXO) comes at a great cost to Solomon Islands in finance and in lives.@@@At this juncture.@@@I would like to thank the Government of the United States of America for their continued assistance to the efforts to date.@@@However, more needs to be done to address that threat.@@@I call on responsible countries to remove the UXO and compensate the lives affected and lost.@@@Since the inception of the United Nations in 1945, the Pacific Islands has remained a stage for power projection by developed nations.@@@As a consequence, from 1946 to 1996, approximately 300 nuclear devices were tested in the Pacific, including in the Marshall Islands.@@@French Polynesia and Kiribati.@@@Did we have a say in that?@@@We did not.@@@Those countries and their people must be compensated commensurably.@@@The nuclear footprint of big Powers in the Pacific is intrinsically carved into our history and genes.@@@To this day, certain populations continue to suffer from health issues because of nuclear testing and dumping in the Pacific.@@@As a signatory to the 1985 Treaty of Raratonga and the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, our commitment to keeping our blue Pacific continent nuclear-free is non-negotiable.@@@We ratified the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty earlier this year, which is a testament to our conviction and principle for a nuclear-free Pacific.@@@We remain concerned about the development of military nuclear investment within the Pacific region, its potential to trigger a nuclear arms race and its implication for our nuclear-free status.@@@Solomon Islands stands with like-minded Pacific islanders and is appalled by Japan’s decision to discharge more than 1 million tonnes of treated nuclear wastewater into the ocean.@@@We note that the assessment report of the International Atomic Energy Agency is inconclusive and that the scientific data shared remains inadequate, incomplete and biased.@@@Those concerns were ignored.@@@If that nuclear wastewater is safe, it should be stored in Japan.@@@The fact that it is being dumped into the ocean shows that it is not safe.@@@The effect of that act is transboundary and intergenerational and is an attack on global trust and solidarity.@@@The message is therefore clear: our lives and our people do not matter.@@@The increased warming and acidification of the ocean against the discharge of treated nuclear water over a period of 30-plus years poses worrisome risks for our people’s well-being and future.@@@We call on Japan to explore other options in addressing the treated nuclear wastewater and to immediately stop discharging it into the Pacific Ocean.@@@If we are to rebuild trust and reignite global solidarity, we must be honest and frank in protecting our oceans, which are the lifeblood of our people.@@@I am morally and ethically obliged to speak for humankind, the voiceless and our children’s children.@@@We are the ocean.@@@It is our past, our present and our future.@@@It is the foundation of our very existence.@@@It is our identity.@@@Please stop the discharge of nuclear treated water, or history will judge us.@@@In conclusion, in framing the future, we want, and we need, a reformed rules-based international system that is ready for the future and responsive to today’s reality.@@@A change of attitude and approach is needed.@@@The need to understand and reach out to the vulnerable is critical.@@@We must restore our faith in the United Nations Charter and end all wars.@@@We must renew and reaffirm our focus with vigour, matched with resources to deliver on our 2030 Agenda.@@@We have only one life to live.@@@Let us therefore right the wrongs of the past by rebuilding trust and reigniting solidarity to accelerate action on the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals towards peace, prosperity, progress and sustainability for all.@@@I conclude by paraphrasing Winston Churchill: Let us therefore brace ourselves to our duty and so bear ourselves that, if humankind and the United Nations 
last for 1.000 years, men and women will still say: this was their finest hour.@@@hi mi tugeda — you and me together — for a better United Nations.@@@To God be the Glory, great things He has done.@@@May God bless all present, and may God bless the United Nations.@@@In an international context marked by growing divisions, increased tensions and a decline in trust, it is with a great sense of responsibility that, as Prime Minister and Head of Government.@@@I take the floor in this great Assembly, representing the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe.@@@I would like to respectfully pay tribute to the victims of the recent earthquake in Morocco and the floods in Libya.@@@Let me take the opportunity of this general debate of the seventy-eighth session of the General Assembly to congratulate Ambassador Dennis Francis on his election and to express to him our full support throughout his term of office.@@@We also thank the outgoing President.@@@Mr. Csaba Korosi, for his commitment in conducting the work of the previous session, particularly given the complexity brought about by new conflicts and the global food crisis.@@@The theme chosen for this year’s World Population Day.@@@“Unleashing the power of gender equality”, which we applaud, is highly relevant at a time when humankind is going through the greatest of threats, reversing progress in human development and widening inequalities in our respective States.@@@The Protocol on the Rights of Women in Africa, known as the Maputo Protocol, is celebrating its twentieth anniversary, and we must acknowledge that there is a huge deficit in terms of empowerment and equal opportunities, particularly with regard to women’s participation in political decision-making bodies.@@@However, we could also mention the Istanbul Convention, which, despite being binding for the signatory States, did little to translate the Council of Europe’s will into results.@@@That issue, like others, is a global objective that requires the commitment of the international community.@@@Governments, organizations and civil society to create a fairer and more equitable world for all.@@@Given the persistent and increasing challenges that remain, particularly in terms of poverty, hunger, inequalities and environmental issues, beyond our addresses, we, the leaders of the various nations represented here, must question ourselves and recognize our failures to protect our planet and ensure shared prosperity by 2030.@@@My country, a small island State that has enjoyed effective democracy for more than 30 years, and which is still developing, is one of the main victims of climate change, ecosystem degradation and economic dependence.@@@My country is experiencing a situation of genuine economic and financial urgency in the short term, well known to our main partners, while, at the same time, going through a complex process of transition to the middle stage of development and pursuing a policy adapted to its reality, respecting multicultural diversity and human rights.@@@We have striven, with some success, to adopt the codes, recommendations and good attitudes aimed at achieving the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, but the structural problems, asymmetries of all kinds and a lack of trust in democratic institutions on the part of our populations are increasing.@@@We should not hesitate to point the finger at those responsible for climate disruption within the Group of 20, or at the bodies of global economic governance that continue to ignore our social and environmental objectives, in particular by denying us access to financial resources in reasonable quantities and conditions.@@@Even more worrisome is the fact that we are witnessing an increasing polarization and fragmentation of the world and global governance, with its growing proportion of populism and nationalism.@@@The very digital technological society, which could have been the catalyst for the development of our countries and global citizenship, is becoming a new source of inequality, wealth concentration and domination.@@@Inequality, a lack of respect and a lack of inclusion can lead only to ever- greater fractures and setbacks.@@@Coups d’etat and attempts to subvert the constitutional order are becoming increasingly frequent, while long-standing conflicts, such as those in Palestine and Cuba, persist.@@@Those in Yemen.@@@Syria, the Sudan and Libya are following the same path.@@@Armed conflicts in violation of international law, regardless of their nature, also receive differential treatment.@@@Our condemnation of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was clear and without hesitation because we respect international law and the Charter of the United Nations.@@@Unfortunately, refugees and the dead are not equal in rights and dignity in a world that claims to be civilized.@@@It seems that today only global pandemics are capable of uniting and mobilizing us.@@@We are slow to act in order to impose peace in response to the latent conflict in the Great Lakes region, while the list of dead, displaced people and destruction of all kinds continues to grow, and international peace missions show their limits owing to the lack of clear and effective commitments to those who are the primary victims.@@@It may be too late, but indifference and hypocrisy are unacceptable.@@@Our problems as poor countries tend to also become the problems of rich countries — demographic disparity, economic disparity, climate deregulation and the loss of institutional trust, among other things.@@@However, there is still hope of finding new impetus if we resolutely commit to reforming our institutions, starting with the United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions, towards a renewed and more supportive multilateralism.@@@As leaders, it is our duty to cultivate an art capable of articulating the expected solutions that can enlighten so many human beings whose experience is nothing more than a journey of suffering and uncertainty.@@@True leadership means finding the necessary compromises.@@@It means having the ability to make peace and promote progress.@@@As the saying goes, nature abhors a vacuum, and our rhetoric, our appeals at summit after summit, ring hollow.@@@We are convinced that peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies, with educated and trained young people in good health, are in the common interest, and that we must therefore use common sense to prevent major and unpredictable disruptions.@@@We still have the technical, financial and human resources to reform the international political system.@@@The rich countries have a responsibility, but ours cannot be excluded either.@@@I reaffirm the firm commitment of the Democratic Republic of Republic of Sao Tome and Principe to actively collaborating with its regional and international partners in all initiatives aimed at eradicating all acts that are inhumane, harmful to human beings and the environment and detrimental to humanist values and freedom.@@@We firmly believe that our Organization is the converging centre of our causes and is the only entity whose role is to structure and systematize our common challenges and lead the harmonization of our world, while respecting cultural differences, models and systems of government and economic choices.@@@Before concluding.@@@I would like to say how especially grateful my country is to our Secretary- General.@@@Mr. Antonio Guterres, for his tireless efforts to strengthen the role of the United Nations in promoting peace, democracy and the protection of human life worldwide, as well as in the fight against poverty and climate change in all their forms.@@@His determination challenges and compels us.@@@Today I am wearing a traditional fabric from East Nusa Tenggara.@@@Indonesia, while members of my delegation are wearing diverse traditional fabrics representing the diversity of more than 1.000 ethnicities in Indonesia.@@@We are diverse, but we are one.@@@The world now is at a strategic crossroads.@@@Global solidarity and collective responsibility are the only answer to address the trust deficit and global inequality.@@@That is the main essence of the outcome of the Bandung Conference, or Asia-Africa Conference, in 1955.@@@Through the 10 Bandung Principles, we called for respect for human rights and the Charter of the United Nations, sovereignty and territorial integrity, the equality of all races and all nations, the peaceful settlement of disputes and the promotion of mutual interests and cooperation.@@@The Bandung Conference reminded every country of its equal rights and responsibility in maintaining peace and stability, mainstreaming win-win cooperation and championing solidarity.@@@Indonesia brought along the Bandung spirit when we presided the Group of 20 last year, served as Chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) this year and visited Africa last month through our President.@@@We will continue to bring that spirit everywhere we go, including the General Assembly.@@@The Bandung spirit enables Indonesia to listen and become part of the solution.@@@For Indonesia global leadership should not only be about power or the influence to dictate to others.@@@Instead.@@@Global leadership should be about listening to others, building bridges, respecting international laws consistently and putting all nations on an equal footing.@@@Rebuilding trust and reigniting global solidarity is the theme for this year’s General Assembly.@@@The theme is timely and on point.@@@We are again at a strategic crossroads, as we were in 1955.@@@The trust deficit has reappeared, and the lack of solidarity has resurfaced.@@@Both have hampered the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially for countries in the global South.@@@The question is — do we really have the commitment to rebuild trust and reignite global solidarity to attain the SDG targets together?@@@Will our presence today at the General Assembly really bring commitment and show readiness for global unity and collective responsibility?@@@Standing before the Assembly, we have uttered a lot of good words and promises.@@@Let us now be honest with ourselves: do we do what we said we would do?@@@If all of us were committed to doing what we say and saying what we do.@@@I am sure the current world situation would not be what we see right now — where the trust deficit is running deep, where differences are ever greater and sharper and where wars and conflicts are tearing us apart.@@@The problem is that what we do is different from what we said.@@@We talk differently about what we did.@@@We do not walk the talk.@@@Against that backdrop.@@@I would like to share some thoughts on how we can rebuild trust and reignite global solidarity, in line with what we envisioned through the Bandung spirit.@@@First, on forging collective global leadership, the fate of the world cannot be defined by the mighty few.@@@A peaceful, stable and prosperous world is the collective right and responsibility of all countries, big and small.@@@North and South, developed and developing.@@@We must all do our part and work together towards that common goal.@@@And that can be achieved only if all of us adhere to the same rules.@@@We must uphold respect for international law, particularly the fundamental principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity.@@@That will ensure that disputes will be settled at the negotiating table rather than on the battlefield.@@@A collective responsibility is also needed for the people of Palestine and Afghanistan.@@@For far too long, we have allowed our Palestinian brothers and sisters to suffer.@@@Indonesia will not back down an inch in our support for Palestinian statehood.@@@In Afghanistan.@@@Indonesia will do its utmost to help the Afghan people and ensure that the rights of women and girls are respected, including their right to education.@@@Secondly, on advocating development for all, every country has the same right to develop and grow.@@@But the global architecture of today benefits only the select few.@@@Trade discrimination against developing countries continues to happen.@@@The global supply chain is being monopolized by certain countries.@@@Many developing countries may not meet the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.@@@They also struggle with foreign debt and development financing.@@@All of that will contribute to the erosion of trust and solidarity.@@@Therefore, it is time for us to make a real change.@@@Industrial down-streaming must not be an exclusive call from developing countries.@@@Developed countries should also support that call to build a stronger future together.@@@The same ideals are applicable in our fight against climate 
change and sea level rise, as well as safeguarding biodiversity.@@@Indonesia has led by example by fulfilling its international obligation, including being among the early signatories to the Agreement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas beyond National Jurisdiction.@@@But developing countries cannot do that by themselves.@@@We also need developed countries to fulfil their responsibility, including on climate financing, green investment and the transfer of technology.@@@Technology and innovation should not be exclusively for the select few.@@@Access to safe and secure digital technology for developing countries, including artificial intelligence, is crucial for future sustainable growth.@@@Now is the time to practise what we have preached.@@@Thirdly, on reinforcing regional cooperation, regional institutions should be net contributors to, and building blocks for, global peace and prosperity.@@@As this year’s ASEAN Chair.@@@Indonesia had to navigate ASEAN through such geopolitical dynamics in the region.@@@ASEAN has already managed to do that for the last five decades.@@@We sent a clear message that we will not let our region be a pawn in rivalries.@@@Instead.@@@South-East Asia must be an epicentre of growth, where all countries can benefit meaningfully.@@@Inclusivity will forever be the pillar of our region’s architecture.@@@Suffice it to say — we managed to pull through.@@@ASEAN has maintained its unity and established a long-term vision for ASEAN 2045.@@@It has reinforced its centrality in strengthening regional resilience and preparing for the economy of the future.@@@ASEAN has initiated closer partnerships with the Pacific Islands Forum and the Indian Ocean Rim Association for a stable and peaceful Indo-Pacific.@@@We translated the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific into concrete and inclusive cooperation.@@@With regard to Myanmar, the implementation of the five-point consensus remains the main reference.@@@ASEAN continues to urge the military junta to implement it.@@@ASEAN will spare no effort to ensure that the people of Myanmar are not left alone.@@@Before I conclude.@@@I wish to underline one point concerning the reform of our multilateral system.@@@Many proposals have been produced throughout the years, but we are still far from getting anywhere.@@@The best time for action may have already passed.@@@But the second- best time is now.@@@Let us translate our commitment into action.@@@The 2024 Summit of the Future cannot fail.@@@Trust and solidarity must be part of those efforts.@@@Our people and the world await, and we must deliver.@@@Let me join in the congratulations to Mr. Dennis Francis on his election as President of the General Assembly.@@@This is the first time that a national of his country.@@@Trinidad and Tobago, has assumed that office and only the fourth occasion that a representative of a Caribbean Community (CARICOM)@@@State has been so elected.@@@Let me therefore not only wish him success as he presides over our deliberations, but also assure him of the fullest levels of respectful cooperation from Saint Lucia as we 
work together to advance the collective interests of our common civilization.@@@There are many amongst us — the small and marginalized islands of our globe, surrounded by rising seas and scorched by rising temperatures — who are beginning to question this annual parade of flowery speeches and public pretence of brotherhood otherwise known as the annual general debate of the General Assembly.@@@What is the point, we are beginning to ask, of meeting here every year when every time the international community is called upon to take the agreed collective actions on the critical issues affecting the poor and the powerless, there is always some hesitation and delay once we vacate this historic building?@@@And so, with just seven years left to the target year of 2030, we are gathered at this seventy-eighth session of the General Assembly to discuss accelerating action towards the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development because its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are in peril.@@@We have been summoned here to rebuild trust and to reignite global solidarity for the 2030 Agenda when trust and hope are the devalued currency of global dialogue.@@@Despite our greatest efforts to maintain faith and belief in the principles of global engagement, our entire post-independence experience has been one of dashed expectations and institutional frustration.@@@In the 1990’s we watched helplessly as powerful countries utilized the World Trade Organization to dismantle Saint Lucia’s marketing arrangements for bananas in Europe, forcing hundreds of our farmers into poverty while those already rich countries provided huge subsidies to their own farmers.@@@When some of our Caribbean countries successfully developed our financial services industries, we were blacklisted and grey-listed as if we were lepers and global undesirables.@@@However, the Russia-Ukraine war has now clearly revealed to us which metropolitan capitals are the real tax havens and which are the true pipelines for illicit money.@@@And now today, our citizenship by investment programmes, which we have successfully pursued for decades, are being undermined while the golden passport and golden visa programmes of some members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development remain unquestioned, untouched and unmolested.@@@We nonetheless remain committed to keeping our programmes transparent even whilst we strengthen our due-diligence regime.@@@Saint Lucia has come to this seventy-eighth session to say there must be justice in the relations between developed and developing countries and that we are no longer willing to come to this annual parade merely to lend our voice to support of this or that global conflict or to condemn whoever, from year to year, is the new global enemy.@@@No powerful nation’s global agenda is more important than our own, and we insist that our legitimate concerns be listened to and acted upon.@@@The people of the Caribbean and Saint Lucia have been designated by the African Union as part of its Sixth Region, which comprises people of African origin residing outside the continent.@@@We feel ourselves obliged to seek justice, through reparations, for the crimes against humanity that tore our ancestors from our African homeland and enslaved them in the lands of the Western hemisphere.@@@It is laudable that, for the past decade and a half, the United Nations has been observing 23 August as the International Day for the Remembrance of the Slave Trade and its Abolition.@@@The United Nations is also to be commended for proclaiming the International Decade for People of African Descent, which ends in 2024, and we look forward to the proclamation of a second decade.@@@However, the time has now come for the issue of reparations for the transatlantic slave trade and slavery in the Western hemisphere to become a more central part of the global agenda and work of the United Nations, and not an issue only to be whispered about in the corridors and at the margins.@@@It was the 400 years of the enslavement of Africans and colonialism that led to the need today for action to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.@@@The Secretary-General made that unambiguously clear in his message this year to mark the International Day of Remembrance of Slavery and the Slave Trade.@@@He said:
“We can draw a straight line from the era of colonial exploitation to the social and economic inequalities today” (A/77/PV.63, p.2).@@@Reparations for slavery therefore mean that the countries that benefited and developed from 400 years of the free labour of enslaved humans should now pay back for that free labour.@@@We urge the United Nations to embrace that principle as a central part of its work in the coming years, with set goals, timelines and programmes of action.@@@In the same way, we cannot speak of accelerated action for the Sustainable Development Goals for 
developing countries, when developed countries do not treat the climate challenges facing developing countries with the sense of urgency and importance they deserve.@@@Those challenges not only negatively impact our economic growth, but threaten our very existence.@@@Yet, developed countries behave as though they are blameless and not responsible to repair and compensate for the damage they have inflicted on our planet.@@@Have they not understood that climate change is a danger not only to the existence of small island States, but to the survival of all countries today, and not tomorrow?@@@In just about two months, we shall be travelling yet again to another conference on climate change, the twenty-eighth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP28), in Dubai.@@@We will be doing so with the current extreme and extraordinary weather events graphically demonstrating the gravity of the climate crisis.@@@On behalf of the people and the Government of Saint Lucia.@@@I extend sincere sympathies to the peoples and the Governments of the Kingdom of Morocco.@@@Libya and the other countries that have recently suffered the obvious ravages of climate change.@@@The new manifestations of the crisis are signalling to us that the goal of 1.5°C to stay alive is now very much at risk.@@@It is said that the Roman emperor Nero fiddled while Rome burned.@@@We cannot continue to be like Nero, talking away while the planet is literally burning and sometimes drowning.@@@If COP28 is to be transformational and not another disappointing.@@@Nero- like conference, then it must deliver an ambitious global climate action plan to 2030 if it is to answer to the necessity for climate justice for developing countries like Saint Lucia.@@@Having said that, we wish to reiterate, however, that what is critically needed is a complete reform of the global financial system to make development financing truly developmental and climate financing truly just.@@@As has been said so many times before and in so many different forums by so many small island developing States, the negotiations and the agreements for development assistance for those States must take into account their peculiar vulnerabilities.@@@Consequently, one area where accelerated action is certainly necessary is that of the adoption of a multidimensional vulnerability index for small island developing States, in order to replace the gross national income per capita as a primary measure for concessionary financing.@@@Another measure that should be considered is the Recovery Duration Adjuster, as proposed by the Caribbean Development Bank, which measures the internal resilience capacity of a country after a shock or natural disaster.@@@It is past time for the multilateral development banks and international financial institutions to introduce those reforms.@@@But global financial reform has to be comprehensive and radical, as put forward in two recent proposals that I commend to this organ and to international financial institutions.@@@The first is the Bridgetown Initiative, presented last year by my CARICOM colleague.@@@Prime Minister Mia Mottley of Barbados, which argues for resilient finance mechanisms that will address both the climate and development crises facing developing countries.@@@The second is the Secretary-General’s SDG Stimulus to deliver agenda 2030, submitted in February.@@@Both plans are an appeal for immediate action, and they provide a practical pathway to sustainable development and climate justice.@@@There is therefore no deficit of ideas for reform of the international financial architecture; there is simply a dearth of good will.@@@In the declaration issued in 2015 on the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, it was said that, “there can be no sustainable development without peace and no peace without sustainable development” (resolution 70/1, p.2).@@@Today, eight years later we are in a world without peace and the Sustainable Development Goals are in jeopardy.@@@How can trust and global solidarity for sustainable development be rebuilt when the unwarranted Russian war in Ukraine rages on, with its collateral economic damage to other countries the world over, including biting inflation, particularly on food prices, high oil prices and shortage of food?@@@If trust and global solidarity for sustainable development are to be rebuilt, the unjust, unilateral and inhumane economic embargo against the people of Cuba must immediately be withdrawn.@@@The unmerited and cruel sanctions against the Government and the people of Venezuela should cease.@@@The Palestinian people should have their own State alongside Israel, in accordance with relevant United Nations resolutions.@@@The people of the Republic of China on Taiwan should be allowed the continued enjoyment of their right to self-determination and the exercise of their democratic freedoms without threats to their autonomy and with a place in international forums.@@@There must be an end to the conflicts in Africa and a halt to all forms, whether old or new, of the neocolonial exploitation of the continent’s resources, so that the African people can fully benefit from the riches of their lands and from greater unity among African nations.@@@In our Caribbean region, the States members of CARICOM remain gravely concerned over the deteriorating political, social, humanitarian and security crises in Haiti, their sister member State.@@@Haiti needs the urgent and dependable support of the international community.@@@The response to date has been underwhelming.@@@United Nations efforts of a few months ago to raise $780 million for humanitarian purposes have received low pledges.@@@The need for robust security assistance to counter the murderous armed gangs is clear, yet the decision to enable it is meandering slowly through the Security Council.@@@The Caribbean Community hopes that the establishment of the multinational force will be given full endorsement by the Security Council as a demonstration of the commitment of the international community to supporting the restoration of law and order and improving the humanitarian conditions of the people of Haiti.@@@CARICOM welcomes the Government of Kenya’s willingness to lead such a multinational force.@@@States members of the Caribbean Community will contribute personnel as well.@@@The Community will also continue its good offices efforts through its Eminent Persons Group to assist the Haitians stakeholders in finding a solution to the political crisis — a critical necessity to pave the way towards an improved future for the people of Haiti.@@@I urge the various Haitian stakeholders to cooperate with CARICOM to find a political compromise for the sake of the Haitian people and in honour of their heroic and fabled ancestors, whom they revere so much for daring to break the chains of slavery 200 years ago and bring freedom to the black people of the Caribbean.@@@The immorality of the suffering, the destruction and the death that those conflicts are bringing to the world is not the only reason for our appeals to end them.@@@That immorality is matched only by the absurdity of the expenditure on the arms that sustain those wars and inhibit peace.@@@That should be of grave concern to all of us.@@@What is of equal concern to States like Saint Lucia is the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons, which ran into billions of dollars in 2022.@@@Not only do those arms and light weapons fuel lesser conflicts all over the world, but illegal small arms facilitate criminal activities in Saint Lucia and other CARICOM member States.@@@Illegal firearms were responsible for 70 per cent of the homicides in the Caribbean Community in 2022; and in Saint Lucia, the majority of homicides are firearms-related and involve young people, both as victims and perpetrators.@@@Yet, neither Saint Lucia nor its fellow CARICOM member States manufacture small arms, light weapons or ammunition.@@@Their sources are our continental neighbours to the north and south of the Caribbean.@@@Saint Lucia therefore continues to strongly support the international instruments aimed at preventing and curbing the illicit traffic in small arms and light weapons.@@@I welcome the announcement by the United States Administration earlier this year that it will provide technical assistance and support to combat illegal weapons smuggling into the Caribbean and in solving gun-related cases.@@@Let us be reminded that SDG 16.4 aims at significantly reducing illicit arms flows.@@@There is, however, hope for global solidarity.@@@In June, the Intergovernmental Conference on Marine Biodiversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction adopted the historic Treaty of the High Seas.@@@For Saint Lucia, a small island developing State, the protection of the oceans is an imperative, since the oceans and their resources do not belong to one country but are the heritage of all humankind.@@@Saint Lucia signed the Treaty this week and will move towards its ratification in the shortest possible time.@@@I offer my congratulations on the opening of the United Nations Youth Office.@@@As I said in my address last year (see A/77/PV.10), the importance accorded to youth by the United Nations is in harmony with my Government’s policy of giving priority to youth affairs through the creation of a Youth Economy, in which young people, with State assistance, can turn their talents, skills and hobbies into businesses that will provide sustainable self-employment.@@@I am therefore pleased to report that our Youth Economy was formally launched in March and has been met with enthusiasm and success.@@@To date, about 300 young persons in Saint Lucia have benefitted from funding and training from the Government to assist them in starting or supporting their businesses, and the numbers continue to grow.@@@Once again.@@@I invite the international community to engage with us on mutually beneficial relationships and projects to promote the Youth Economy.@@@Though the Youth Economy, we are responding to the SDGs, and with my Governments policy of putting people first, we are addressing the other SDGs.@@@After the destruction and ruin of the twentieth century’s world wars and the Cold War, one would have thought that the start of the twenty-first century would have ushered in a new era of global solidarity.@@@It has not.@@@In conclusion.@@@I ask these questions, for which we must all provide urgent responses as the fate of the 2030 Agenda depends on our answers.@@@Is there the political will and commitment to divert financial resources away from destructive activities like wars and other conflicts?@@@Is there the political will to place those financial resources instead into the productive action of responding to the climate crisis?@@@Is there the political will to use those trillions of dollars to end starvation and underdevelopment in the world and provide the justice of reparations?@@@Is there the political will to put people first and not weapons first?@@@Is there the political will to develop trust and build a lasting peace that will rekindle our Sustainable Development Goals and lead towards prosperity, progress and sustainability for all?@@@For the sake of us all and for future generations, we must find it.@@@To quote Saint Lucia-born Nobel laureate.@@@Derek Walcott: “Hope is not a thing to be deferred, but a thing to be pursued with all hungry passion of our existence”.@@@At the outset, it is my pleasure to sincerely congratulate Mr. Dennis Francis and, through him, the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago on his presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session.@@@I wish him every success in conducting its work.@@@I assure him of our support for his vision of peace, prosperity, growth and sustainability.@@@I would also like to express to Mr. Csaba Korosi.@@@President of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session, my deep gratitude and appreciation for his successful presidency.@@@I would like to reiterate our appreciation and support for the efforts of the Secretary-General.@@@Mr. Antonio Guterres, and for his valuable initiative to promote multilateral action.@@@Our world today is experiencing a delicate phase with numerous challenges and crises amid growing conflicts and wars, along with deepening geopolitical divisions and obstacles that prevent the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@In addition, the crisis of indebtedness faced by developing countries has continued, while the poverty and hunger gap is widening between the countries of the North and the South.@@@We must also mention the unprecedented increase in the number of refugees and migrants, the continuing impact of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and the acute climate crisis.@@@Is that really the world to which we aspire after almost eight decades since the establishment of the United Nations?@@@That image is very distant from the goals and values upon which the Organization was founded.@@@We call for the creation of new approaches and means that are more effective to meet the challenges of today.@@@We also call for strengthened international cooperation and solidarity on the basis of common but differentiated responsibilities.@@@We would also like to reiterate the need for everyone to truly respect the Charter of the United Nations, international law and human rights, without politicization.@@@That is the way to rebuild trust among States, support multilateral action and achieve security, peace and development.@@@With that in mind, we hope that this session will be a historic turning point and a new start for the multilateral system and international cooperation.@@@Hundreds of millions of people had great hopes in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and yet what has been achieved to date is regrettably short of our aspirations.@@@Bearing that in mind.@@@Tunisia supports the stimulus plan of the Secretary-General to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, and the practical proposal therein that seeks to provide the necessary funding for their implementation.@@@We also appreciate the Secretary-General’s initiative on addressing global crises related to food, energy and finance issues in order to mitigate the impact of the war in Ukraine on food and energy prices.@@@In that context, we would like to recall the appeal of Mr. Kais Sated.@@@President of Tunisia, during the Food Systems Summit, held recently in Rome, to create a strategic stockpile of cereals for the entire world that can be used when necessary.@@@We need to acknowledge that the international monetary system that was created following the Second World War has clearly failed to provide a global safety net and to guarantee concessional and sustainable financing for developing and least developing countries.@@@Quite to the contrary, that system has disappointed those countries and contributed to widening the gap between developed countries and developing countries that face difficult choices today, including having to use most of their resources to reimburse and service their debt or meet the vital needs of their peoples.@@@That is why we call today for substantive reforms of the international financial system and for a change in global economic governance.@@@That is an essential priority to overcome current imbalances and differences and establish a sound system that invests in sustainable development and future generations.@@@Furthermore, we call for responsible and serious engagement to facilitate the recovery of looted funds from abroad to help the people of affected countries and make them rely on their own resources.@@@It is also important to avoid those kinds of violations in the future.@@@The challenges facing the world today — the impact of climate change, deterioration of the ecosystem and worsening of national disasters — compel all of us to take urgent action as an absolute priority despite, the fact that our countries are not responsible for the current situation of our planet.@@@In that context.@@@Tunisia appreciates the initiative of the Secretary-General, who called for the convening of the Climate Ambition Summit.@@@We also reiterate the need to continue and step up international efforts to achieve needed solutions.@@@All responsible actors should assume their responsibility by providing climate funding to countries that are most affected.@@@Illegal migration has worsened in our geographical area due to the inadequate development of many African States.@@@That can be attributed to prolonged conflicts, the effects of climate change and the fact that criminal 
networks are exploiting the precarious conditions of thousands of people who are seeking better opportunities in life and are trafficking them, whether in countries south or north of the Mediterranean Sea or sub-Saharan Africa.@@@While reaffirming the need to adopt a global approach to tackle the issue of illegal migration, which includes addressing its root causes rather than simply its consequences, we once again stress the need for all parties to assume their responsibility.@@@That includes countries of origin, transit and destination, as well as regional and international organizations.@@@In that context, we call for the continuation of the process of the International Conference on Migration and Development, which started in Rome based on a Tunisian- Italian initiative.@@@Tunisia has always dealt with the issue of illegal migration to the extent of its ability based on its firm commitment to human rights and respect for international commitments.@@@We assure that Tunisia will not accept concealed settling of illegal migrants.@@@Furthermore, we condemn all irresponsible political or media exploitation of the suffering of victims of illegal migration for political purposes.@@@Tunisia has not been an exception to what the world has experienced and continues to experience in terms of economic, social and life challenges.@@@We intend to overcome those difficulties, notwithstanding the current difficulties, and to strengthen our resilience and sustainability in cooperation with our brothers, friends and partners, while preserving the guiding principles of our national policies and independent decisions.@@@We will continue tirelessly the process of reform, the strengthening of good governance and the fight against corruption in order to review and strengthen our democracy and the performance of State institutions.@@@We will put an end to the irresponsible political manipulations that we have seen for over a decade.@@@All of that is in response to the aspirations of the Tunisian people, who sincerely expressed them on 25 July 2021.@@@The people will remain attached to their aspirations until this reform process is completed, despite all challenges and pressures.@@@We also intend to strengthen our resilience in the face of challenges, including regional and global challenges, lack of funding, the effects of climate change and the consequences of COVID-19 pandemic.@@@Our country, as part of a presidential initiative, was the first to call for strengthened international solidarity to combat COVID-19, through the adoption by the Security Council of resolution 2532 (2020), co-sponsored by France.@@@We also will continue our efforts to empower women and young people and to strengthen their participation in public life and decision-making.@@@We are also working on transitioning successfully to a green and blue economy, strengthening digital transformation while providing social protection for all our citizens, and ensuring the fair distribution of economic growth.@@@During this important period.@@@Tunisia will rely on its own resources, and we call on our partners to work with us constructively, as part of our process of reform and modernization, and to support our economic recovery efforts on the basis of our shared interests and common destinies, as well as our intelligent political assessment.@@@Tunisia also stresses the need to continue the process of reform and revitalization in our Organization.@@@In that context.@@@Tunisia has effectively taken part in the implementation of the Secretary-General’s report on Our Common Agenda (A/75/982), and we hope that the Summit of the Future will be an opportunity to reiterate the commitment of everyone to our common principles in order to build a secure and lasting future for humankind.@@@That also reflects our vision to create a new global order that is more balanced and with no hierarchy among States, because where justice is absent, we see an increase in poverty, wars and terrorism.@@@We need a new global vision on concepts of security and peace that focuses on the root causes of instability and the trends towards violence and war.@@@The historical injustice and suffering which have been imposed on the Palestinian people for more than seven decades of occupation, as well as its attendant oppression and atrocities are unacceptable, illegal, immoral and inhumane.@@@The same goes for the silence of the international community as the occupation authorities continue to disregard resolutions of international legitimacy and the principles of international law while carrying out their policy of aggression and settlement plans.@@@That is why we once again call on the Security Council and the international community to assume their responsibilities and compel the occupation authorities to respect resolutions of international legitimacy with a view to achieving a just and peaceful solution based on international agreed parameters, putting an end to the occupation and suffering of the Palestinian people while allowing them to recover their legitimate rights to create an independent, geographically contiguous and sovereign State within the borders of 4 June 1967, with Jerusalem as its capital.@@@We all call for the State of Palestine to be a full-fledged member of the United Nations.@@@Turning to our immediate neighbourhood.@@@Tunisia reiterates its firm commitment to provide all possible assistance to our Libyan brethren with a view to helping Libya overcome its differences and achieve a political agreement based on intra-Libyan dialogue, with the help of the United Nations, to preserve the unity, sovereignty and independence of Libya.@@@We reiterate our rejection of any military solutions and any form of foreign interference, direct or indirect, in the internal affairs of Libya.@@@Along the same lines, we call for convergence of United Nations and international efforts to achieve political solutions in both Syria and Yemen to put an end to the suffering of their brotherly peoples, to bring peace and security to them and to preserve their sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity.@@@Tunisia also calls for an end to the escalation in the brotherly country of the Sudan and for the prioritization of dialogue in order to overcome the crisis.@@@We call on the international community and the United Nations to help Africa to rid itself of the constant crises, for which the continent is only marginally responsible.@@@We reiterate the importance of including a moral dimension in the economic field by taking into account the interests of African countries.@@@In conclusion.@@@I would like to stress that we are all at a crossroads today.@@@Given the scale of the unprecedented risks and challenges that affect everyone and threaten our world and future generations, the choices we make should be based on our intelligence and longterm vision and on the commitment to our humanity.@@@Those choices should also be based on the belief in our shared destiny and commitment to the United Nations Charter, the principles of solidarity, cooperation and responsibility.@@@Those choices will play a decisive role in restoring credibility in the multilateral system.@@@At the outset, we would like to express our warm congratulations to Mr. Dennis Francis and his friendly country.@@@Trinidad and Tobago, on his election to preside over the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session.@@@We also express our great appreciation to Mr. Csaba Korosi of the friendly nation of Hungary, the President of the Assembly at its previous session, for his efforts and good management.@@@And we would like to convey our greetings and respect to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for his laudable work to promote and achieve the purposes and principles outlined in the Charter of the United Nations and the values of justice and peace worldwide, as well as to fulfil the Sustainable Development Goals and enhance effective international cooperation in addressing the common challenges facing our world.@@@We reaffirm Oman’s firm commitment to cooperating with the international community in that regard.@@@Dialogue is a steadfast principle and a successful approach for the Sultanate of Oman in its foreign policy, given its effectiveness in achieving reconciliation, consensus and peace among all parties to conflicts and all nations generally.@@@In that regard, we would like to take this opportunity to reaffirm Oman’s unwavering commitment to engaging with the international community in its pursuit of a peaceful global system based on justice, fairness and respect for the Charter, international law and the sovereignty of nations, as well as non-interference in their internal affairs.@@@We urge the international community to remain committed in that regard to the United Nations system as a means for settling disputes and resolving conflicts, and to use dialogue in order to arrive at peaceful solutions and negotiate to realize a world characterized by dignified living, prosperity, stability, security and peace.@@@We are linked to the United Nations and all other countries by the unity of the purposes and principles through which we achieve our goals.@@@By the grace of God, we will continue to support the truth and just causes, and the Palestinian question stands at the forefront of enduring causes, with a people who have suffered injustice that has lasted more than 70 years.@@@The Palestinian people, however, have stood firm in confronting Israel’s brutal occupation, siege and oppression and its violations of international law and Security Council resolutions.@@@Like all other peace-loving nations and communities, we see no alternative for a settlement of the issue other than a two- State solution such as is outlined in the parameters and resolutions of international legitimacy, including the Arab Peace Initiative.@@@The United Nations has a moral and legal responsibility to find a just and equitable solution to the question that can ensure an end to the dire suffering endured by the Palestinian people and the restoration of their legitimate rights to freedom and self-determination.@@@That includes the withdrawal of Israel from the territories occupied after 1967 and the establishment of an independent Palestinian State with East Jerusalem as its capital.@@@The ramifications surrounding the Russian- Ukrainian crisis and the escalating security and military situation there, as well as the painful humanitarian consequences, pose a significant threat to international peace and the flow of energy and food supplies, as well as representing a serious challenge to international cooperation and the global system based on respect for the law and the Charter.@@@My country therefore calls for dialogue and peaceful negotiations based on harming no one, as well as respect for State sovereignty, good- neighbourliness and sincere efforts to address the root causes of the crisis.@@@The Sultanate of Oman is actively implementing various plans and programmes aimed at adapting to climate change and mitigating its effects.@@@We are also working to promote investment in renewable energy projects, in line with our 2050 carbon-neutral strategy.@@@My country is committed to participating actively in the upcoming session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, scheduled to take place in November in Dubai.@@@Oman’s Vision 2040 serves as a gateway for my country towards promoting sustainable development, overcoming challenges and keeping pace with regional and global change.@@@The ongoing modernization of the educational system at all stages and improving its outcomes are key 
to the development of human beings and enabling them to advance economic development.@@@The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic brought lessons for all States and societies, making it necessary for them to review preparations and response mechanisms to health-care emergencies, with a view to promoting their capacities in that regard.@@@Perhaps one of the most important lessons drawn relates to the need for early preparedness in addressing public health risks and threats along with investing in scientific research and technological development.@@@My country held a global conference at the ministerial level with the aim of devising solutions to antibiotic resistance and accelerating cooperation at the national, regional and international levels in order to reduce that threat to public health and to States’ economic capacities.@@@We would also invite all States to encourage partnership in the areas of research, innovation and industry in order to develop preventive and treatment alternatives to reduce the effects of epidemics and stop their spread.@@@My country is seriously determined to bolster human rights and promote the relevant international treaties and conventions with a view to bringing about an international community that is fair and has absolute respect for the dignity and rights of all human beings and for the religious and cultural values of States.@@@In that context, my country rejects and condemns all acts of incitement to violence, hatred and discrimination based on religion or race.@@@We call on the international community to adopt clear and explicit legislation that criminalizes such acts, which pose a threat to social peace and security and even to the national security of States and societies.@@@We are currently grappling with complex challenges worldwide.@@@Those challenges include the exacerbation of climate change, the spread of epidemics and the trafficking of drugs and human beings, in addition to political and sectarian conflicts.@@@We therefore call on the family of nations to firmly uphold the principles of rights and justice and to implement international law, without any double standards, so that security and safety can prevail among peoples and trust among States, and so that partnerships among peoples can develop and prosper.@@@In conclusion, we would like to wish the General Assembly every success at this session.@@@Please allow me to start by conveying to the General Assembly fraternal greetings from Ms. Samia Suluhu Hassan.@@@President of the United Republic of Tanzania, who could not attend this current important session due to pressing national commitments.@@@It is a great honour and privilege to address the Assembly on her behalf and for the people of my country.@@@I also wish to join those who spoke before me in congratulating the President of the General Assembly on his election to preside over the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session.@@@I pledge Tanzania’s full support to his presidency.@@@Similarly.@@@I wish to pay tribute to his predecessor.@@@Mr. Csaba Korosi. 
who successfully steered the Assembly during the seventy-seventh session.@@@In the same way.@@@I commend the Secretary-General and the Secretariat for their dedicated service to humankind in the face of many daunting global challenges.@@@This year, the Assembly is meeting specifically with a view to rebuilding trust and reigniting global solidarity.@@@However, for decades now, the persistent voice of the global South calling in the wilderness to make straight the way towards peace, prosperity, progress and sustainability for all has fallen on deaf ears.@@@The hitherto strong historical solidarity, fraternity and commitment to the principles of non-interference, equality among nations and mutual benefit, which was bequeathed to us by the founding fathers of the United Nations, is withering away.@@@As a result of that paralysis in multilateralism, we have now begun to witness shifting geopolitical tectonic plates and the creation of new blocs seeking to replace the now obviously dysfunctional world order.@@@Trust among States has worn away, and there is erosion of the rule of law and a reversion to unilateralism.@@@The effectiveness of the United Nations system and multilateral financial institutions is being questioned more than ever before, calling for their immediate reform.@@@All this is happening at a time when the world is reeling from the aftershocks of the coronavirus disease pandemic, the relentless wrath of climate change, horrendous armed conflicts, global food insecurity, the looming energy and debt crisis, persistent poverty and growing inequality.@@@Furthermore, the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) has been disappointing, mainly as a result of the global North’s unfulfilled promises of financing and technology and the limited fiscal space in most African countries.@@@In order to rebuild trust, it is imperative that the global North walk the talk on its promises and listen to the voices of the global South.@@@Analogously, the global South must re-engineer its domestic revenue-mobilization efforts, including by putting an end to the haemorrhage of its natural resource wealth and the illicit capital outflows.@@@Peace is undeniably a prerequisite for achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@Ironically, some nations are still firing guns and missiles at each other even in the twenty-first century.@@@However, the fact is that the massive production of weapons and the skyrocketing military spending on armed conflicts are compromising the promises we all made to the most vulnerable among us — children, young people, women and the poor — to build a better, prosperous world and create opportunities for all, leaving no one behind.@@@In that regard.@@@Tanzania highly commends the United Nations for its tireless efforts in maintaining international peace and security.@@@We applaud the Secretary-General’s New Agenda for Peace, unveiled on 20 July, which provides a great vision for multilateral efforts to establish peace and security on the basis of international law.@@@I therefore implore each one of us in the Assembly to give due consideration to the priorities stipulated therein, for they resonate very well with the spirit and essence of the theme of the Assembly’s current session.@@@Tanzania remains fully committed and ready to work with the United Nations family in maintaining global peace and security to make the world a safer place in which to live, not only for us but, more importantly, for the generations to come.@@@Tanzania firmly believes that the world needs to invest more in dialogue and diplomacy to prevent and resolve armed conflicts.@@@Wars and confrontation must be avoided at all costs, because in war everyone loses, including the non-warring parties.@@@In that regard.@@@Tanzania has and will continue to contribute to peacemaking and peacekeeping efforts in Africa and elsewhere in the world.@@@As of March.@@@Tanzania stood as the twelfth-largest contributor among the 125 countries that contribute to United Nations peacekeeping missions.@@@Tanzania urges the international community to increase its support for regional initiatives to bring peace to war-torn parts of the African continent.@@@Those who participate in fuelling conflicts in Africa, either for the purpose of profiting from arms trade or gaining access to blood mineral wealth, should be tracked and condemned openly by the United Nations.@@@With regard to combating terrorism.@@@Tanzania has strengthened its capacity to deal with cross-border terrorism by working with our neighbours and international partners, especially through the sharing of information and strategies.@@@Three days ago, we gathered in this Hall for a second review of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the implementation of the 17 SDGs.@@@It is discouraging to note that, at the half-way point, we are off-track to meet most of the Goals.@@@The progress report of the Secretary-General reveals that progress towards a mere 15 per cent of the 140 targets is on track, while progress towards a staggering 37 per cent 
of the targets has either stagnated or even regressed from the 2015 baseline.@@@That underperformance calls for supercharged implementation and partnership, especially the prioritizing of scaled-up investment in people.@@@Tanzania is fully committed to implementing the SDGs as envisaged.@@@In July, it submitted its second voluntary national report, which shows that there has been significant progress overall with respect to SDGs 2 to 7, as indicated by an increase in the food sufficiency ratio, the availability of essential medicines, the decline in the under-5 mortality rate, the increase in pre-primary and primary education gross enrolment rates, the significant milestones achieved in pioneering gender equality, the improved water supply coverage in urban and rural areas and the proportion of the population with access to electricity.@@@However, only moderate progress has been recorded under SDGs 1. 8 and 10.@@@To ensure successful implementation of the SDGs.@@@Tanzania is determined to take actions to improve further the domestic revenue effort, while capitalizing on public-private partnerships.@@@We are also prioritizing investments in the social-service sectors, agriculture, agribusiness, value addition and infrastructure, as well as in developing skills for young people.@@@In addition, harnessing science, technology and innovation is key to hastening the implementation of the SDGs.@@@Climate change has become the world’s greatest threat.@@@Recent natural calamities that have devastated areas of a number of countries around the world have amplified the horrible effects of climate change.@@@On that note.@@@Tanzania offers its deepest condolences to the Governments and the peoples of Libya and Morocco for the loss of life and property caused by floods and earthquakes in their countries.@@@Beyond that, the recently released sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change sounded the alarm about the reality that the world is not on track to succeed in remaining below the 1.5°C limit on the overall temperature increase agreed in Paris.@@@Disturbingly, the report also indicates that Africa is warming at an accelerated pace that is outstripping the global rate.@@@As a result, climate change has continued to adversely affect Africa and hamper its progress, and will continue to do so.@@@Tanzania therefore reiterates its call for urgent and concerted action on the part of all nations to cut greenhouse-gas emissions and strengthen mitigation and adaptation measures.@@@Together we must create an enabling environment and facilitate the investments needed to unlock the resources for scaling up the implementation of our climate commitments and the decarbonization of the global economy.@@@We, the global community, must act with urgency.@@@Tanzania also reiterates its call for a fair and just clean-energy transition for Africa.@@@Unilateral coercive measures have serious adverse effects on the economies and innocent lives they target, especially those of women and children, the very people whom we have committed to not leaving behind.@@@Tanzania remains steadfast in its opposition to injustice, wherever and by whomever it is committed.@@@We stand against the imposition of unjust economic sanctions and other unilateral coercive measures that undermine sovereignty and prosperity for all.@@@We also continue to stand in solidarity with our brothers and sisters who continue to be denied their rights to self-determination or are living under occupation or domination.@@@We call for the lifting of unjust sanctions and an end to occupation and subjugation.@@@Tanzania also advocates for the peaceful resolution of all territorial disputes in accordance with the principles set out in the Charter of the United Nations.@@@In conclusion.@@@I would like to reaffirm Tanzania’s unwavering commitment to supporting the United Nations and its Member States in implementing our common global agenda.@@@We call on warring parties around the world to silence their guns and missiles and prioritize peace.@@@Let us act towards one another with humility, not arrogance.@@@Let us abide by the traditional wisdom that tells us that an eye for an eye leaves everybody blind.@@@Let us act together to address the climate crisis and hasten the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@Our humble plea is for the voices, promises and solutions made and proposed at this rostrum to bring hope to the hopeless, dignity to the humiliated and justice to all.@@@At the outset, allow me to express my most heartfelt condolences to the authorities of Morocco and Libya following the devastating events that have taken place in those two countries.@@@I would like to express Monaco’s solidarity and support to the Moroccan and Libyan people, who have shown remarkable courage and resilience in these particularly trying times.@@@In 1993.1 took the floor for the first time from this rostrum as Head of the Delegation of the Principality of Monaco to address the General Assembly at its forty-eighth session (see A/48/PV.5).@@@As my country celebrated the thirtieth anniversary of its admission last spring, my determination to ensure that Monaco contributes actively to achieving the aims of the Charter of the United Nations is all the stronger as the challenges that threaten us continue to grow and compel us to act.@@@This year we are celebrating the seventy-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.@@@I would like to pay tribute here to the passionate commitment of Eleanor Roosevelt, who played a decisive role in the drafting of that historic document aimed at ensuring that every human being, anywhere, can enjoy their inalienable rights.@@@In recent decades, the United Nations has been at the heart of progress that only multilateralism can generate: from the Agenda for Peace, adopted in 1992 at the first Security Council Summit; to the Agenda for Development, adopted in 1997 by the General Assembly; to the Millennium Development Goals in 2000; and the Sustainable Development Goals in 2015.@@@We owe those significant advances to our collegiality.@@@Monaco was still an observer at the United Nations when my Father.@@@Prince Rainier III, decided to take part in the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, also known as the Rio Conference, which adopted Agenda 21 and what are commonly known as the Rio conventions.@@@Our participation in the Earth Summit was one of the triggers for the Principality’s wish to apply for full membership in the community of nations that sits in this illustrious Hall.@@@Respect for the environment and wildlife on land and at sea, as well as support for science, have been fundamental priorities for the Princes of Monaco over the centuries.@@@Today, what was an unwavering commitment has become an obligation for our survival.@@@That is why Monaco signed the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Convention on Biological Diversity and, subsequently, the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification.@@@Those international treaties, although subsequently supplemented, continue to guide our actions to preserve the planet from an environmental catastrophe that could wipe out all progress.@@@In that respect.@@@I would like to emphasize the extent to which the enhancement of international law is an underestimated success of our cooperative efforts within the United Nations and recall that, since its admission to the United Nations, the State of Monaco has become a party to some fifty international treaties, covering a wide range of subjects such as human rights, disarmament, the environment and the law of the sea.@@@Over the past year, multilateralism has once again demonstrated its strength and effectiveness in certain areas, thanks to perseverance.@@@In December, we reached an historic milestone by adopting the new Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework.@@@A few months later, we managed to conclude almost two decades of negotiations by finalizing the Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction treaty, which I had the honour of signing just a few hours ago.@@@I am convinced that this binding legal instrument will mark another decisive step for the protection and preservation of the seas and oceans.@@@Those victories, which are the fruits of our collective efforts, should give us hope because beyond the ocean and biodiversity, they embody the very potential of the United Nations: that of building common structures that allow for improved coexistence in harmony with nature.@@@Furthermore.@@@I believe it is essential to recognize that those new instruments offer us powerful tools to combat climate change.@@@Among Aboriginal or island 
peoples, the sea is a being in its own right.@@@The crucial role of seas and oceans in climate regulation is now clearly recognized and allows us to approach that challenge holistically.@@@Make no mistake: we can win the climate battle only by moving forward towards achieving all the Sustainable Development Goals, which we established together eight years ago.@@@We must not waste another moment.@@@Extreme climatic events, floods, droughts and fires, whose frequency and intensity continue to increase, are already causing millions of individuals to suffer and require that we take urgent and drastic action.@@@Physical changes to the marine environment and coastal areas, ocean acidification and sea level rise are other phenomena that pose threats to the very existence of coastal communities in many countries.@@@The desire of the Secretary-General to bring together the leaders of States, representatives of private institutions and civil society in the framework of the Climate Ambition Summit could not be timelier given that the latest report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has alerted us once again to the inadequacy of our collective efforts to combat that planetary scourge.@@@Several months ago, we began the initial process of assessing the implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.@@@That global assessment, which will culminate at the twenty-eighth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, cannot be allowed to fail.@@@On the contrary, we must seize the last opportunity offered to us to correct our course with a view to limiting global warming to 1.5°C.@@@Let us face the facts: profound and sometimes difficult changes to our lifestyles and our collective organizations are essential and must be made rapidly.@@@We must also step up our solidarity so that justice and equity are the key words of this transition phase.@@@In that context.@@@Monaco wishes to assume its share of responsibility.@@@The Government of Monaco will therefore contribute to the reconstitution of the Green Climate Fund in the amount of €3.3 million for the period 2024-2027.@@@That represents an increase of 10 per cent as compared to the previous period, even though Monaco is already the leading donor per capita to that instrument that is so crucial to the implementation of the Paris Agreement.@@@For more than a century.@@@Monaco has led the way in trying to establish better coexistence between people and the sea.@@@Ten years after the adoption of the Samoa Pathway, the question of the oceans will once again be at the centre of the work of the fourth International Conference on Small Island Developing States, which will be held in 2024, and the third United Nations Ocean Conference, which will be held in Nice in 2025 under the chairmanship of France and Costa Rica.@@@Monaco has decided to actively collaborate with the organizers of that conference and will host discussions on the blue economy, the conclusions of which will hopefully enrich that work.@@@While the still unexplained phenomenon of cooling in the Eastern Pacific Ocean challenges researchers, the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development offers us an opportunity to better understand the complex phenomenon of climate change.@@@What major countries have achieved in space should be accomplished for our oceans.@@@While we look for the presence of water on the planet Mars, we had to wait a generation before holding another conference on water last March, under the leadership of the President of the seventy-seventh session of the General Assembly.@@@The young people of our nations place before us a crucial responsibility: that of ensuring the preservation of the air they breathe, the land on which they grow and the seas and oceans that are the cradle of humankind and the key to its survival.@@@That fight will never end.@@@Conflict also seriously damages the environment and poses an additional obstacle to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@It has been nearly 600 days since Russia made the decision, in violation of international law, to launch large-scale aggression against Ukraine.@@@The Assembly has denounced that aggression, as well as its humanitarian and environmental consequences, on several occasions.@@@I would like to express once again the solidarity of my country in the face of those tragic events and the destruction endured every day by civilian population.@@@As in all conflicts, fighting and bombing generate pollution of the soil and water with toxic substances.@@@Countless protected natural areas have been destroyed, while damage to critical infrastructure increases the risk of polluted drinking water and the spread of disease.@@@Moreover, it is inconceivable that in the twenty-first century health personnel should be regularly assaulted and health infrastructure should be attacked in different conflict zones.@@@I therefore call once again for the protection of those professional and civilian populations.@@@With the world barely recovering from the coronavirus disease pandemic.@@@I would like to welcome 
the organization of three high-level meetings dedicated to major public health issues this week.@@@We must learn from the experiences of the pandemic to strengthen global governance and build strong and resilient health systems.@@@Among the questions and existential threats for our civilization, there is one that has taken on overwhelming proportions in recent years.@@@I refer to artificial intelligence, which carries with it both immense potential for accelerating the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and unprecedented risks for global peace and security.@@@The quest for innovation is part of human nature and deserves our support when directed at the improvement of the lives of our populations.@@@While there may be a certain fascination with the benefits of digital tools that simplify our daily lives, we cannot neglect their dangers.@@@Artificial intelligence often proves to be more efficient and reliable than humans in many tasks.@@@However, as Aesop observed, it may be either the best or the worst thing to happen to humankind.@@@Cyberattacks using artificial intelligence are already targeting critical infrastructure such as hospitals and United Nations humanitarian aid operations.@@@The security and arms industry exploit those techniques, the potential of which raises ethical questions.@@@Can we let a machine decide the life or death of a human being?@@@Those questions demonstrate the obligation that we all have to establish a global governance framework and ethical standards that impose limits on the use of artificial intelligence.@@@The conclusion of ongoing work in that area is therefore of the utmost urgency.@@@In that regard.@@@I welcome all the work aimed at developing a high-level consultative body within the United Nations to work on the international governance of artificial intelligence.@@@While reaffirming its role as a moderator and its peaceful tradition.@@@I remain convinced of the central role of the United Nations in rebuilding trust and awakening global solidarity.@@@That requires joint efforts anchored in a strong multilateral system that is faithful to the values and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.@@@I conclude by expressing the hope that we will succeed in improving the efficiency of our Organization so that it can fully achieve its initial mission: that of preserving peace between nations and the well-being of our common humanity.@@@At the outset.@@@I would like to congratulate the high representative of Trinidad and Tobago.@@@Mr. Dennis Francis, on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session.@@@I wish him success and fruitful work in his important position.@@@He can count on the support of Kyrgyzstan during his presidency.@@@I express my gratitude to the President of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session, the representative of friendly Hungary.@@@Mr. Csaba Korosi, for his active work and support for Kyrgyzstan’s international initiatives.@@@Today the world is at a turning point.@@@We are all witnessing and seeing with our own eyes the negative changes in the world order and increasing geostrategic competition between major Powers and their blocs.@@@Geopolitical tensions are pushing the world towards fragmentation into regional and subregional financial and economic blocs and systems.@@@It is also obvious that the Governments of various countries will be compelled to make economic, technological and geopolitical choices.@@@Among the shocks on a global scale that have not yet completely become a thing of the past.@@@I would like to note the spread of the coronavirus infection, which has cost humankind millions of lives and economic losses exceeding $12 trillion.@@@The world today is experiencing the highest inflation rates and highest food prices ever seen in the past 60 years.@@@The repercussions of geoeconomic fragmentation, according to the International Monetary Fund, could lead to a drop in global gross domestic product by 7 per cent.@@@The decline in trust among different countries and groups of countries is alarming.@@@However.@@@I am convinced that current global challenges and risks — from the climate crisis and the threat to food security to growing inequality — should, on the contrary, unite all the members of the international community.@@@It is vital to build a multilateral system that does not allow the further fragmentation of the geopolitical landscape in the world.@@@Were international conditions easier 78 years ago, when the United Nations was just beginning its work after the bloodiest and most destructive war in human history, than they are today?@@@Were the contradictions among countries, especially political and ideological, less acute then than in our time?@@@What prevents Member States from hearing one another and trying to overcome their differences and establish a dialogue?@@@In recent years, despite the Iron Curtain and military bloc thinking, the United Nations has been and remains the most legitimate and commonly recognized platform of diplomacy, uniting developed and developing countries, large and small.@@@Kyrgyzstan 
strongly supports the United Nations as the only universal intergovernmental international organization mandated by all Member States to find solutions to the challenges and threats that constantly arise before humankind.@@@I count on our Organization, under the leadership of Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and with the effective support of Member States, to find mechanisms and ways to more effectively perform all its functions and assist Member States in resolving pressing global issues and overcoming challenges.@@@That is especially crucial in supporting sustainable development through the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@I call on all Member States to provide unconditional political support to the Organization and its Secretary-General at this challenging time.@@@I thank the Secretary-General for presenting his New Agenda for Peace policy brief, with his vision for the future of multilateral security cooperation.@@@We agree with the main thesis that the driving force behind the new multilateralism must be diplomacy.@@@We are ready to work closely on the active development of the pact for the future during the Summit of the Future in 2024.@@@Speaking of Central Asia.@@@I would like to note that we, representatives of the Central Asian nations that are related and proud of their millennia-old history and culture, have a lot in common in traditions and customs.@@@There is much that brings us together in terms of similarities in mentality, psychology, attitude and our view of the world.@@@On the one hand, ongoing global processes have a direct impact on stability and security in our Central Asian region and, on the other, they strengthen its role and significance.@@@Strengthening relations with the countries of the region is a top priority for our country.@@@I note with satisfaction that, in recent years, regional cooperation in Central Asia has been developing consistently and in all directions.@@@I see our region as a single geoeconomic space in which all forms of economic cooperation and interaction are successfully developed.@@@I see our region as a geopolitical intermediary through which the interaction and cooperation of members of the international community takes place.@@@I see our region as a highly connected and dynamic community that shares and supports similar cultural, historical and traditional values and beliefs.@@@Kyrgyzstan intends to contribute to strengthening regional cooperation, find new effective forms of cooperation and actively interact with various global centres of influence in bilateral and multilateral formats alike.@@@On the path to full regional integration, it is necessary to resolve issues related to the legal delineation of State borders.@@@Exactly a year ago, speaking from this very rostrum (see A/77/PV.4), with a heavy heart I informed the Assembly of the tragic events of September 2022, related to armed clashes on the Kyrgyz-Tajik border that resulted in numerous casualties.@@@Thanks to the restraint shown by our peace-loving people and the prevailing political will of both sides, we were able to prevent the further escalation of the conflict and avert full-scale bloodshed in the region.@@@In that regard.@@@I would like to emphasize that Kyrgyzstan has advocated and will continue to advocate resolving controversial issues exclusively through peaceful diplomatic means based on the principles and norms of international law, such as territorial integrity and the non-use of force or the threat of its use.@@@We have never sought to take what belongs to others, but we will not allow anyone to take a single inch of our homeland.@@@We always strive for dialogue and the search for mutually acceptable solutions based on trust and mutual respect.@@@Last December, after almost 30 years of negotiations, we signed an agreement with Uzbekistan on the legal delineation of the State border.@@@That historic decision, reached thanks to the demonstrated political will of the leaders of the two States, has opened the broadest prospects for mutually beneficial cooperation and peaceful coexistence between the two countries and peoples.@@@We maintain the same approach in our current negotiations.@@@We want to live in peace, harmony and friendship with all our neighbours.@@@Speaking of security and stability in Central Asia, it is essential to consider them in the context of the situation in Afghanistan.@@@I believe it extremely important to remind the international community that the people of Afghanistan are experiencing significant difficulties, which are amplified by the lack of a coordinated global stance on the situation in that country.@@@It would not be an exaggeration on my part to say that Afghanistan is threatened by a humanitarian crisis with inevitable consequences for the security of not only the surrounding regions, but also the entire world community.@@@Kyrgyzstan is interested in a peaceful, stable and prosperous Afghanistan.@@@We call on the international community to continue providing humanitarian and economic assistance to the Afghan people.@@@The SDG Summit concluded just yesterday, confirming once again the importance of unwavering commitment to sustainable development, identifying challenges in their implementation and outlining specific commitments by States.@@@We are halfway to 2030, the deadline for reaching the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).@@@Kyrgyzstan, in its pursuit of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, currently ranks forty-fifth out of 166 Member States.@@@We aim to be among the top 30 countries in reaching the SDGs by 2030.@@@The international community must breathe new life into the Goals and strengthen solidarity in their attainment.@@@It is important that we do not lose ourselves in numbers, schedules, diagrams and other economic intricacies, because the essence and core of the 17 Goals are about people themselves.@@@The year 2030 is approaching quickly and we must ask ourselves: Have we addressed the pressing needs and aspirations of humankind?@@@Are we ensuring its safety, prosperity and well-being?@@@Are people happy?@@@What does their future hold?@@@Problems such as extreme poverty and climate change can be solved only by finding a global, collective response.@@@As the Secretary-General rightly notes in his Financing for Sustainable Development Report 2023.@@@“without the means to invest in sustainable development and the transformation of their energy and food systems, developing countries are falling even further behind”
in achieving the SDGs.@@@The current reality is that developing countries face a dual challenge: the need to invest in development while simultaneously adapting to climate change.@@@In that regard, we call for urgent action to implement the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on financing for development, and specifically for the swift establishment of the fund aimed at providing compensation to countries for losses and damages related to climate change, alleviating the burden of external debt and improving the international architecture for debt resolution.@@@At previous climate change summits and conferences, ambitious statements and promises were made.@@@It is also clear that the level of annual funding announced in 2015 under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change is no longer sufficient.@@@We consider it necessary to revise and significantly increase the level of funding that meets the real needs of countries vulnerable to climate change.@@@Another problem is that most climate finance is provided to low- and middle-income countries in the form of loans.@@@There is also no difference in the procedures for allocating loans for projects worth $1 million or $1 billion.@@@That undermines the very essence and purpose of climate agreements.@@@I have already reached out to our partners with a request to exchange external debt for environmental projects.@@@Unfortunately, we have received no reaction from many of the developed countries.@@@The Government of Germany was the only country that wrote off €15 million of debt.@@@We take this opportunity to express our gratitude to Germany.@@@We call on donors to reconsider their approaches in favour of climate finance to countries in need on a grant basis.@@@We support the Bridgetown Initiative, proposed at the 27th Climate Change Conference, held in Sharm el-@@@Sheikh, as well as the calls made at the Summit for a New Global Financial Pact in Paris, held in June, to mobilize the necessary financing and structural reform of the international financial architecture.@@@If we do not start doing this now, then injustice will increase throughout the world.@@@Rich countries will continue getting richer and poor countries will continue getting poorer.@@@In the light of global climate change, mountainous regions have been particularly vulnerable.@@@In Kyrgyzstan, mountains occupy about 94 per cent of the territory.@@@Mountain glaciers are an integral part of the Earth’s cryosphere, not only influencing the climate of our planet but also providing a habitat for flora and fauna and supplying water to people.@@@Climate change in Central Asia has led to the intensive melting of glaciers.@@@While it was once predicted that by 2050 the area of glaciers in Kyrgyzstan would be reduced by half and that by 2100 they could disappear altogether, there is now reason to believe that this will happen much sooner.@@@That is leading to the exacerbation of problems throughout the region, such as lack of water for drinking and agriculture, land degradation and a threat to food security.@@@In accordance with the latest assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the adverse effects of cryospheric changes are particularly acute for the residents of high mountain regions, where ecosystems have reached the limits of adaptation.@@@In order to effectively preserve mountain ecosystems and glaciers, based on resolutions previously adopted by the General Assembly on sustainable mountain development, our country, in collaboration with the Global Mountain Partnership and other representatives of the United Nations system, has developed a global action plan.@@@We are grateful to all our partners, countries and international organizations for their joint work.@@@Kyrgyzstan advocates the creation of a broad coalition of mountainous countries.@@@We believe that climate adaptation and the transition to a green economy will be among the main priorities of that future coalition.@@@As members may know, in 2022, at the initiative of our country and the Italian Republic, the General Assembly unanimously adopted resolution 77/172, on sustainable mountain development, co-sponsored by 110 member States.@@@That document declared the years from 2023 to 2027 as Five Years of Action for the Development of Mountain Regions.@@@I take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude to all United Nations Member States for supporting our initiative.@@@To further implement the United Nations resolution.@@@I have signed a decree entitled On Declaring the Period from 2023 to 2027 as the Five-Year Period of Action for the Development of Mountain Regions in the Kyrgyz Republic.@@@A national Road Map for the Implementation of the Five-Year Period of Action for the Development of Mountain Regions for 2023-2027 has been developed, which will be adopted shortly.@@@The Road Map includes measures at the global, regional and national levels, including within the framework of existing and prospective projects and measures related to the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@As the concluding stage of the Five-Year Period of Action, we plan to host the second Global Mountain Summit.@@@Bishkek+25, in Kyrgyzstan in 2027.@@@25 years after the first Summit.@@@From this rostrum.@@@I would like to invite everyone to actively participate and make concrete commitments to preserving mountain ecosystems.@@@We express our gratitude to our partners from the Group of Friends of Mountainous Countries, the Global Mountain Partnership and the entire United Nations system for their comprehensive support of Kyrgyzstan’s initiatives.@@@We express our readiness to continue fruitful cooperation.@@@To successfully meet the challenges and threats facing us, we need to build an effective international security system.@@@A key element of that mechanism is the Security Council.@@@Today more than ever, it is crucial to enhance its effectiveness in order to make that organ fairer and more representative and to increase its capacity to achieve consensus in decision-making.@@@Progress is needed in negotiations on the reform of the Security Council.@@@Kyrgyzstan expresses its readiness to make its contribution to the cause of peace and security through effective peacemaking, respect for human rights and the equal participation of women in peace processes.@@@We also aim to promote and protect the interests of developing, small, least-developed and small island nations.@@@We have put forward our candidacy for non-permanent membership of the Security Council for the 2027-2028 term and count on the support of Member States.@@@It is essential for all of us to adhere to principles such as trust, solidarity and universality in international relations.@@@Only together can we restore the global and regional security architecture.@@@Speaking of contemporary challenges and issues.@@@I would like to quote the words of our outstanding compatriot.@@@Jusup Balasagyn, who lived from 1020 to 1075 and gave guidance more than 1.000 years ago.@@@He said.@@@“Our world is such that you must grasp its essence to unlock the gates of truth.”@@@Nothing has changed since then.@@@It is necessary to perceive the world as it is, in all its diversity and complexity.@@@We, the States Members of the United Nations, must transform our Organization into the centre of global efforts to prevent conflicts, reach compromises and do everything possible to establish peace and harmony.@@@“The one who walks the path will overcome it”, as a proverb of our people says.@@@At the outset, on behalf of the Government and the people of the Republic of Iraq.@@@I extend my sincere condolences, sympathies and solidarity to the Governments and the peoples of the Kingdom of Morocco and the State of Libya over the catastrophic earthquake that struck Morocco and the floods that swept through Libya.@@@We ask God Almighty to grant mercy to the dead and a speedy recovery to the injured.@@@I come here today bearing the greetings of Iraq and its people, who were among the 50 nations that founded this great Organization 78 years ago.@@@Iraq has always believed and to this day believes in the general principles upon which the United Nations was founded and contributes to all its programmes, convinced that there is no path but that of human brotherhood and solidarity to safeguard the continued secure existence of the entire world.@@@The spirit of consensus and understanding has prevailed in the new Iraq, and we have overcome difficult days.@@@We now have a Government that enjoys a broad political coalition that includes all Iraqi sects and components.@@@The Government has adopted a comprehensive and ambitious reform programme to correct our course, restore confidence in the political system, provide a decent living for citizens, secure their future and build a strong, capable Iraq.@@@On that path, we have adopted a programme with critical priorities reflecting issues that relate to the basic needs of our people and that must be implemented without delay.@@@Those priorities include creating employment opportunities, overhauling services, fighting poverty, raising the standard of living, fighting corruption and enacting comprehensive reforms in the economic, administrative and financial and banking sectors in order to overcome the obsolete legacy of previous administrative systems that were unable to keep pace with changes and global development.@@@We have made important strides on that path in record time, and investment in Iraq has developed and opened up to the global economy and to fruitful partnerships.@@@We have signed many agreements in various sectors, and Iraq is now a safe environment that attracts investors to great and promising opportunities.@@@Iraq remains an important oil State and pivotal in the global energy market.@@@It offers good opportunities, projects and businesses in that field.@@@We have launched the Road to Development initiative, a pioneering project that is one of the most up-to-date in the region.@@@It is a vital land corridor connecting essential economic hubs of our developing region, and the best and most appropriate path for trade and economic exchange in the region and in the field of transportation and economics.@@@It represents a strategic Iraqi vision of connectivity and outreach to the world and positive economic interaction.@@@Many international institutions have reported on the spread of corruption in Iraq.@@@We have diagnosed that scourge and named it the “corruption pandemic”.@@@We have made fighting it our top priority and begun to pursue wanted persons wherever they are, regardless of their position or affiliation, and to surrender them to the Iraqi judiciary for the purpose of eliminating that scourge.@@@In that regard, we ask friendly and partner countries to extend a helping hand to us in fighting corruption in all its phases.@@@We call on them to facilitate the prosecution of those responsible for corruption.@@@We must all join hands and cooperate in fighting corruption and recovering the money that has been stolen, because we believe that there is a symbiotic relationship between corruption and terrorism.@@@That is what we all want to fight.@@@We have established an independent and balanced foreign policy that is focused on cooperation and on bringing viewpoints and commonalities closer together.@@@We want Iraq to be a source of stability in its regional and international sphere, and part of the solution to any international or regional problem.@@@We want Iraq to be an enabler of mutual understanding and cooperation.@@@We seek to build constructive partnerships based on the principles of mutual respect, motivating the various parties and helping to formulate policies that achieve sustainable development for our peace-loving peoples.@@@The Republic of Iraq affirms its commitment to the principles of international law, its respect for all United Nations resolutions and its determination to establish the best relations with everyone, especially neighbouring countries.@@@We reject any interference in our internal affairs, under any pretext.@@@Our Constitution stipulates that Iraq will not be a launching pad for any aggression against other countries, and we call upon everyone to respect Iraq’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.@@@We reserve the right to take appropriate measures, pursuant to international law and conventions, to respond to any violation of our country.@@@We reaffirm that we extend a hand of friendship to all neighbouring countries in order to preserve the security and stability of our region and its economic progress and prosperity, in a way that achieves the well-being of its peoples.@@@Similarly, we hope to achieve regional integration, remove any barrier to free trade in the region, facilitate the movement of people, goods and capital across political borders, and connect infrastructure to other countries.@@@Those are all factors that would mitigate the potential for future armed conflicts and limit to a great extent the escalation of conflicts.@@@We see the possibility of achieving economic integration by standardizing and streamlining economic policies, customs tariffs and laws, and by linking economic infrastructure through joint investment and opportunities.@@@As a gesture to advance those efforts, we are working on organizing the Baghdad 2023 conference on economic integration and regional stability.@@@We will not follow a policy of polarization, but will deal with everyone in accordance with our national interest.@@@We continue to strengthen Iraq’s natural place in the arena of international cooperation and are making every effort to enhance stability.@@@Our Government has made the issue of displaced persons and refugees one of its priorities and has taken many national measures to find sustainable solutions to ensure their voluntary and safe return to their original homes and to rebuild their liberated cities.@@@We have also begun to resolve the issue of missing persons and those who were disappeared at the hands of the criminals of Da’esh, and to provide material and psychological support to their families and to reintegrate them.@@@In Iraq, we are moving towards approving a policy for the protection of civilians in order to safeguard human rights and respect for international humanitarian law by training our security forces and monitoring their performance in the protection of civilians, especially with respect to dangers that arise in armed conflict.@@@We also seek to protect civilians in natural disasters, making Iraq the first country in the Middle East to adopt such a policy and creating an environment for cooperation between security forces and citizens.@@@We are making steady progress towards holding local elections for the governorates by the end of the year, after a 10-year hiatus.@@@The elections are a pillar of decentralization in Iraq and an essential part of the resilience of the governance system and State institutions.@@@The federal Government, through its comprehensive and multiple programmes, enjoys the best of relations with the Kurdistan region and all governorates of Iraq on an equal footing, and is in continuous dialogue with representatives of the region and local Governments in all Iraqi governorates so as to transform opportunities into projects to enhance the development of resources and the Iraqi economy.@@@Our region, and our country in particular — Mesopotamia, the land between the two great rivers — is suffering from drought caused by climate change.@@@There is an urgent need to preserve our rights to water resources and international river basins.@@@The natural bodies of water in the Iraqi marshes function as lungs for the entire planet.@@@Their desiccation would be an ecological and historical loss to every living creature on the planet.@@@They are a human heritage and a chapter in the book of humankind and its civilization.@@@Some 2.550 years ago.@@@Iraq witnessed the first international agreement related to water, so the cradle of civilization must not be allowed to die of thirst.@@@The environmental catastrophe would have a harsher impact on Iraq and the countries of the region due to the unprecedented rise in temperatures, which will turn every aspect of daily life into an almost impossible task.@@@Iraq is therefore working on and calling for great efforts among the relevant regional countries to work together and find an effective mechanism for coordination and the formation of a negotiating bloc within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.@@@We call for the establishment of an integrated mechanism to manage transboundary waters and address the effects of drought, sandstorms and heat 
waves.@@@We stress the need to mobilize international efforts and encourage the United Nations to ensure the sustainability of water resources.@@@In that regard, we call for the establishment of a regional grouping to include the coastal States of the Gulf — including Iraq.@@@Iran and the States members of the Gulf Cooperation Council — that will be disproportionately exposed to a rise in temperatures.@@@That grouping would be tasked with coordinating regional efforts to manage water resources, address climate change, enhance environmental protection and work together to confront drought.@@@At the national level, our Government has taken the steps necessary to reduce emissions and to stop gas flaring and the consequent environmental pollution.@@@We have also initiated several projects in the field of waste recycling and encouraging the use of clean energy.@@@Our Government has also ratified a national strategy to combat pollution and limit its impact for the years 2023-2030.@@@Iraq believes that addressing those challenges requires building institutions capable of dealing with economic challenges and, more specifically, climate challenges.@@@Despite the many cross-border challenges that we face, as all of humankind faces, we seek to confront them effectively within the framework of our national capabilities, in cooperation with our partners and friends.@@@The most important of those challenges is that of drugs, a problem that hinders all development efforts and investment in human resources and youth development.@@@Our Government has therefore adopted a national strategy to combat drugs and psychotropic substances for the years 2023-2025.@@@We, as an international community and Governments of the region, have no alternative but to step up our efforts and coordination in the fight against drugs and all drug-related activities that facilitate their access to our children and our societies.@@@The direct relationship between terrorism and drugs is no secret.@@@Iraq is classified, according to population statistics, as a young country, since young people constitute 60 per cent of the Iraqi population.@@@Accordingly, the Iraqi Government has accorded them priority attention in its governmental programme and seeks to support young people, because they are the best investment.@@@The Iraqi Government has developed many programmes, strategies, projects and initiatives to support young people in various fields.@@@We have launched the Pioneer initiative for development and employment, which is aimed at supporting groups of students and young people, empowering them and developing their creative energies so that they can find decent opportunities in the labour market, create effective economic action and embrace and develop productive scientific and practical ideas.@@@In that way, we hope to encourage students and young people to keep pace with the changes in the labour market and technological development; to invest in individual skills, talents and the ability to innovate and provide thousands of job opportunities to young people; and to ensure them a dignified life.@@@We have also established a Supreme Youth Council, headed by the Prime Minister, with the Minister of Youth and Sports as deputy, and the Ministers of Planning.@@@Finance.@@@Labour.@@@Social Affairs.@@@Education.@@@Scientific Research and Culture as members.@@@Thanks to the Iraqi Government’s sponsorship of the youth and sports sector and the construction of sports facilities and centres.@@@Iraqi sports and student teams have been able to win many awards and titles in various competitions and championships.@@@We cannot fail to emphasize the ongoing efforts of our Government to empower women and grant them their effective right to contribute to all the foundations of the development process, as they have been essential partners in all our victories against terrorism and remain partners in overcoming all difficulties and facing challenges.@@@We reiterate to the world our clear and firm position on the Palestinian right to establish an independent Palestinian State, with Jerusalem as its capital.@@@We also affirm Iraq’s support for the unity of Syria, its land and its people, and we call for an end to the suffering of the Syrian people and their empowerment to exert full control over the entire Syrian territories.@@@In the light of the continuing threat posed by the ability of terrorist organizations to recruit elements that threaten our security and target our countries, it is important to distinguish between incitement to violence, spreading hatred and attacks on the beliefs of others, on the one hand, and freedom of expression, on the other.@@@The burning of the Holy Qur’an is a hate crime aimed at offending the beliefs of a quarter of the world’s population and those who respect sanctities.@@@It cannot be marketed as freedom of expression.@@@In Iraq, we have tasted the bitterness of religious extremism and its consequences.@@@Such actions are at the heart of 
the motives for creating and encouraging extremism.@@@The terrorist Da’esh remains the best example of that.@@@In conclusion, the time has come for Iraq to reclaim its natural place in the international community, following its glorious success in fighting terrorism on behalf of the world and defeating it with the help of friends and partners.@@@The people of Iraq have written an immortal epic in combating the most vicious of criminals.@@@In that regard, we note the wise guidance of Grand Ayatollah Ali Al-Sistani and his blessed edicts, as well as the valour of all the Iraqi security and military forces in those victories and in laying the foundations of social peace.@@@In that spirit.@@@Iraq has become secure and stable and is pursuing its journey and its work, through productive diplomacy, to make Iraq a centre where brothers, friends and partners can meet to build a safe and prosperous region that serves all of our peoples.@@@Iraq is now distinguished by the strength of its resources, its geographical location and the will of its people, who have faced challenges and their triumph was well deserved.@@@Samoa extends its congratulations and best wishes to you.@@@Mr. President, on your assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session.@@@We are delighted to see Trinidad and Tobago, a sister small island developing State (SIDS), at the helm of our organization for the next 12 months, and you will have Samoa’s full support in the successful execution of your mandate.@@@It is an honour to address the Assembly on behalf of the Government and the people of Samoa.@@@We remain steadfast in our support of this multilateral institution and recognize that international cooperation is essential in the fight for a just, more sustainable and peaceful future for our people and planet.@@@While many global challenges remain, it is our hope that in a spirit of global solidarity and unity we can address with urgency the threats of the climate crisis, the accelerated loss of biodiversity, the erosion of human rights and human health, worsening conflicts, the abuse of information and new technologies and the task of finding the political will to strengthen our collective effort to achieve sustainable development.@@@The theme for this year’s General Assembly speaks to our priorities and helps frame our continued engagement with our United Nations family.@@@The effects of climate change are etching a deepening and more devastating impact on our lives.@@@The first half of 2023 was characterized by record temperatures in many regions of the world: intense water temperatures in various ocean basins; droughts in parts of Africa.@@@Europe and Asia; and severe flooding, as well as cyclones and devastating wildfires, in Greece, north-eastern Canada and Hawaii, decimating lives and livelihoods to ash and barren landscapes.@@@I extend Samoa’s deep condolences to the people of Lahaina.@@@Maui, in the United States, and the families and friends of those who have been lost in one of the worst wildfires to have ever affected a Pacific Island community.@@@Indeed, our sympathies go out to all those affected by those devastating disasters.@@@But our sympathies will only take us so far, and we will continually face these ever-worsening disasters if we continue to refuse to address their root causes.@@@Scientists have warned of imminent, more frequent and many more extreme weather events, resulting in more lives lost and costlier, less resilient infrastructure.@@@June of 2023 is remembered for the warmest ever recorded global average temperatures, up by more than 1.2°C compared to pre-industrial levels.@@@Efforts to reduce global emissions such as investing in clean and affordable energy, moving towards green resilient economies, tackling deforestation, reducing the reliance on fossil fuels and protecting nature must be everyone’s priority for the sake of humankind.@@@Targeted solutions must be complemented by ensuring climate finance for front-line countries and utilizing the best available science and technology.@@@Our expectations for the upcoming twenty-eighth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in the United Arab Emirates include crystallized commitments to bring about our envisioned reality.@@@In particular, we wish to highlight the importance of operationalizing the loss and damage fund as quickly as possible.@@@For all members of the Alliance of Small Island States, maintaining global temperatures below 1.5°C is a point of no return.@@@Crossing that threshold spells the end of many of our island societies.@@@We view the climate crisis as an intersecting one, causing damage to the wider environment, such as the biodiversity that forms the web of life we depend on for our livelihoods and economic growth.@@@More than 1 billion people rely on forests for their livelihoods, and land and the ocean absorb more than half of all carbon emissions.@@@The climate problem is worsening as the world’s natural carbon sinks, such as our oceans and rainforests, cease to spawn life.@@@Samoa, as a core member of the small island developing State Coalition for Nature. 
joins the crescendo of voices for the better protection of our biodiversity.@@@The ocean is a vital resource for food and livelihoods and hence requires responsible stewardship that is integral in maintaining our Pacific identity, as the ocean is in us, and we are the ocean.@@@A healthy ocean will help in our fight against climate change.@@@As the Blue Pacific continent, we must ensure that our oceans can still provide for us as we sustainably manage our marine resources, ecosystems and biodiversity.@@@We urge our Member States to assist in combating illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing in our region which deprives our small island developing States of much-needed revenue in a time of increased fiscal stress.@@@We believe in the interconnectedness of our responsibilities to our people and planet as reflected in the collective stewardship of our ocean and the goodwill that resulted in the adoption of the new Agreement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas beyond National Jurisdiction.@@@That is an important milestone on the path to sustainably managing the high seas and our oceans resources.@@@Therefore, let us all sign the treaty for a timely ratification.@@@Similarly, we are engaged in the ongoing negotiations on a treaty to end plastic pollution.@@@The need to address the global plastic pollution problem, especially in the marine environment, is a priority as that is a threat to our ecosystems and health.@@@Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are a priority area for Samoa and our blue Pacific continent.@@@Currently, chronic NCDs are overtaking communicable diseases as the dominant health problem and are the leading causes of mortality, morbidity and disability.@@@At the national level.@@@NCDs account for almost half of the deaths — premature deaths in fact — in Samoa.@@@We have one of the highest obesity rates, in particular among children.@@@Current data, however, shows some positive trends in the falling prevalence rates of alcohol drinkers and an increase in the prevalence of people who are physically active.@@@Those statistics are a catalyst for programmes to promote healthier lifestyles.@@@The Government of Samoa has made people-centred health services and NCD control a priority in its Pathway for the Development of Samoa 2019-2025 and has also issued the National NCD Policy 2019-2023.@@@With support from its development partners, the Samoa Government launched a comprehensive programme in May 2020 aimed at building people-centred and systematic NCD service provision to strengthen primary health care, empower communities, promote early detection and effective referral of NCDs, and increase population awareness of NCD risk factors.@@@Samoa remains committed to the global fight against NCDs through scaled-up capacity-building of all stakeholders, quality-assured data collection and statistics for informed and forward-looking policy decisions, as well as strategic partnerships to mobilize resources and support.@@@To help address the rising burden of non-communicable diseases, we believe that access to a balanced and nutritional diet is a national priority.@@@It is important to return to locally produced quality fresh foods with less reliance on processed imported foods.@@@Nutrition and exercise in combination with other lifestyle changes will do more to curb NCDs but those efforts must be enhanced by financial support for advocacy and capacity-building of our health and education professionals.@@@We learned from the coronavirus disease pandemic experience that, in the event of a global crisis, supply chain issues will disproportionately affect small island States in favour of larger markets.@@@We targeted measures to enable self-reliance, in terms of food production and responsible consumption and the promotion of local food systems.@@@In that area, we relied on support from our partner agencies such as the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, particularly in the promotion of transformative food systems.@@@Small island developing States face a unique set of vulnerabilities that impede their ability to achieve sustainable development.@@@Most SIDS, including Samoa, face high-indebtedness, which is compounded every time there is rebuilding after a natural disaster.@@@We know that natural disasters will increase in frequency and severity for as long as climate change remains unaddressed.@@@A multidimensional vulnerability index (MVI), therefore, will allow for the inclusion of more than just income-based criteria to assess eligibility for concessional finance.@@@We appreciate that the MVI is a tool that aims to create a richer lens on vulnerability, and as SIDS, we look forward to early endorsement and implementation of the MVI.@@@We believe that there are a great many opportunities that arise from an increasingly digitized world, especially when it comes connecting our people in remote areas.@@@We need to take better care of our citizens from the very real threats — cyber fraud and cyberattacks.@@@We need assistance in ensuring that our infrastructure and financial institutions are safeguarded against cyberthreats and that we can build our capacity to address and combat those threats.@@@In that regard, we are mindful of the ongoing work of the Open-ended Working Group on Security of and in the use of Information and Communications Technologies 2021-2025, which will report to the Assembly in 2025.@@@We remain concerned that the war in Ukraine is still ongoing, with no resolution in sight.@@@We hope for a future of world peace, free from conflict, high-tech cybercrimes and electronic crimes, social media abuse and online child sexual exploitation and threats of terrorism, in any form.@@@In a small island developing nation like Samoa, we rely on the collective responsibility of the global community to achieve that through international cooperation, compliance with international law and diplomacy, with the Charter of the United Nations as our guide.@@@We live in a highly contested region that is attracting intensified geostrategic interest.@@@For small island countries in the Pacific, like Samoa, security is more than geostrategic power.@@@An expanded definition of security for the region reflects our desire to nuance our priorities and the demand for climate-resilient and environmentally-conscious infrastructure, rather than simply viewing issues through the lens of strategic competition.@@@That is how we can ensure living in peace.@@@As a small nation with no military force, we continue to highlight the importance of multilateral platforms and the United Nations in conflict resolution and governance.@@@We believe in the rule of law, and we hope that respect for that principle guides us through the types of conflicts we see today.@@@International cooperation is needed now, more than ever.@@@Building resilience at the national level can take us only so far.@@@Samoa is confident that despite all the challenges — and even existential threats, for some of us — there is still hope if there is unity among our United Nations family.@@@We have a moral obligation to change our world for the better and leave hope for our future generations.@@@In conclusion, let me reaffirm Samoa’s commitment to the United Nations and our conviction that it remains the foremost forum to address all issues that transcend national boundaries.@@@We reiterate our call to the United Nations, through its multiplicity of agencies, to better understand our unique cultures, respect our diversity and embrace our differences in order to help build the future we want through mutual and sustainable partnerships.@@@I wish everyone a successful seventy-eighth session of the General Assembly, and I am grateful for this opportunity to address the Assembly.@@@One hundred years ago, on Monday.@@@10 September 1923 — a year after Ireland became independent — we were admitted to the League of Nations.@@@It was an early signal of what would become our unwavering commitment to multilateralism.@@@One hundred years on, we are facing a moment of exceptional crisis.@@@The threat of famine and food insecurity persists around the world.@@@Increased conflict, insecurity, and violence affect the most vulnerable people on this planet.@@@The devastating effect of climate change is contributing to increasing numbers of humanitarian crises, with record numbers of people in need of humanitarian assistance.@@@We are experiencing deep gender inequality; more than 130 million girls are out of school, and less than 20 per cent of the world’s landowners are women.@@@We have seen the stalling — and, in some cases, the reversal — of progress towards the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that we collectively agreed to implement.@@@The Goals represent a high point for international cooperation and the promise of a world that we can securely pass on to the next generation.@@@Ireland is deeply proud of the role that we have played.@@@In 2015, with Kenya, we led the negotiations that created the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@This year, at the half-way point, we worked with Qatar to bring about the political declaration of the High- level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (resolution 78/1), which we unanimously adopted in this Hall on Monday.@@@It is beyond time for us to demonstrate that the Sustainable Development Goals are more than a set of aspirations.@@@It is time for all of us to turn our collective commitments into reality.@@@In July.@@@Ireland presented our second voluntary national review to the High-level Political Forum.@@@Indeed.@@@80 per cent of our SDGs have been fully achieved.@@@In respect of our international contribution.@@@I am proud to confirm Ireland’s commitment to providing at least €225 million annually in climate finance for developing countries by 2025.@@@This year alone, we will spend €149 million on climate finance.@@@Recalling our own great famine, our particular focus on food, agriculture and nutrition will see almost €300 million for programmes in those areas in 2023.@@@We allocate more than 90 per cent of our country specific humanitarian expenditure to the most severe crises, and we have increased our expenditure on global health by more than 15 per cent in the past three years.@@@We are also consistently among the top three donors in the proportion of our official development assistance allocated to promoting gender equality.@@@Earlier this year, the Secretary-General spoke of a world hurtling towards disaster with eyes open.@@@We know that those who have done the least to cause the climate crisis are those most vulnerable to its effects.@@@It is also clear that much of this is now irreversible, particularly for the least developed countries and small island developing States.@@@In responding to that crisis, we cannot leave behind those who are already at the front line.@@@Adequate levels of finance for adaptation are urgently needed, and it is essential that the discussions this week on the loss and damage fund should make real progress.@@@We need to be ready to take a definitive step at the twenty-eighth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Dubai later this year.@@@From our admission to the United Nations, in 1955.@@@Ireland has committed to unequivocally upholding the Charter of the United Nations and to maintain a position of independence at the United Nations.@@@Our term on the Security Council in 2021/2022 saw grave breaches of that Charter, none more flagrant than Russia’s imperialist and brutal invasion of Ukraine.@@@It was an act of unprovoked and unjustified aggression by an expansionist power against its smaller, weaker neighbour.@@@The brutality of those actions has caused unfathomable suffering for the people of Ukraine.@@@As I stand on this most global of stages.@@@I am deeply conscious of the wider suffering it has caused, increasing global food, energy and economic insecurity, particularly in the Global South.@@@Russia’s inexplicable decision last month to collapse the Black Sea Grain Initiative has only made that bad situation worse.@@@For many, including some here today, the war on Ukraine might seem like a European problem — a regional conflict in which there is little at stake for the rest of the world.@@@But have no doubt that each of us in the United Nations has a deep interest in ensuring that Russia’s attempt to move borders by force should not succeed.@@@For when one aggressor prevails, its peers elsewhere will take note and be emboldened.@@@We know this from our history.@@@When Europeans draw attention to the profound injustice of what is happening in Ukraine, there can be criticism, some of it justified, of the developed world’s failure to respond with the same intensity of feeling and action to conflict and suffering elsewhere.@@@We must acknowledge that while we have fallen short, the people of Ukraine should not be the ones asked to pay the price for this.@@@They have done nothing to bring down this war on their heads.@@@They deserve the right we all claim: to determine their own future in peace and security.@@@They deserve the unqualified support — and the action to back it up — of every single State Member of the United Nations.@@@Equally, the Russian Federation and its leaders deserve our utter condemnation for what they have done and are continuing to do.@@@They must be held accountable.@@@This week, the Irish Government announced additional humanitarian assistance for Ukraine and Moldova, bringing our total so far this year to almost €40 million.@@@(spoke in Gaelic; English interpretation provided by the delegation)@@@It is a matter of real pride to the Irish people that Ireland stood firm, consistently, independently and impartially in defence of human rights, humanitarian principles and gender equality during our time on the Security Council.@@@We are concerned at the ongoing threats to peacekeeping operations.@@@We see even national authorities seeking the withdrawal of United Nations peacekeepers, compromising the security of their own people and creating further conflict.@@@Those decisions fly in the face of the anniversary that we are marking this year: that of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.@@@Seventy-five years ago, we created the Declaration, which recognized the inherent dignity and the equal and inalienable rights of all persons.@@@All of us in this Hall have the duty to recognize that dignity and to keep it at the heart of policy-making, and we need the active engagement of civil society to fulfil that duty.@@@As we mark the twenty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Defenders.@@@Ireland urges all States to promote a safe environment both online and offline for a civil society.@@@Among the many horrors of the situation in Ukraine has been the threat — and, indeed, multiple threats — to use nuclear weapons.@@@Such threats are in themselves outrageous.@@@Russia knows, as we all do, that their use would result in devastating humanitarian and environmental disaster.@@@Ireland has long been committed to building a world free of nuclear threats, but we see a world in which their place in security doctrines is growing rather than diminishing.@@@That must be reversed.@@@The stark alternative is a new nuclear arms race.@@@That must not pass.@@@The devastation on innocent civilians of the use of explosive weapons in populated areas cannot continue to echo down generations.@@@We must never witness that again.@@@That is why Ireland led negotiations on a political declaration to respond to the humanitarian consequences arising from their use.@@@We are pleased that 83 States adopted the declaration in Dublin last year, and we urge all States here to join.@@@As we look at today’s world, there are, sadly, too many areas of conflict.@@@But there are few in respect of which we, the international community, have failed so recurrently as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.@@@It should not be so.@@@We have known for decades the parameters of the only just solution: a two-State solution, with a viable Palestinian State based on the 1967 borders, living in peace and security alongside the State of Israel, whose own right to exist should be accepted and respected by all its neighbours.@@@We have affirmed and reaffirmed that many times.@@@Yet day after day, developments on the ground take us further from that vision and make a two-State solution much harder to achieve.@@@We see acts of terrorism perpetrated against Israeli and Palestinian civilians alike; increasingly dangerous and provocative rhetoric; and clear violations of international law.@@@The political and civic space for those who promote peace and reconciliation is rapidly diminishing, and the consequences are stark.@@@My country, along with many others, wholeheartedly agreed with the Assembly’s adoption of resolution 77/247, seeking an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice on the legal consequences arising from Israel’s prolonged occupation.@@@Alongside many here today, we have submitted a statement to the Court.@@@To those who argue that having recourse to the Court undermines the search for a political solution.@@@I can only ask, how does the clarification of international law do anything other than strengthen international peace and security?@@@A just and sustainable peace can be based only on international law, accountability, human rights and on the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations.@@@During Ireland’s recent term on the Security Council, we saw first-hand the positive effect that its work can have.@@@But we also saw its efforts stymied, its mandate undermined and crucial decisions and actions blocked by the use of the veto.@@@Our future requires a United Nations with a reformed Security Council, without the anachronism of the veto.@@@It has no place in the twenty-first century.@@@We also need a Security Council that properly reflects the world’s demography and politics as it is now, not as it was in the 1940s.@@@We know what can be achieved through cooperation at the United Nations.@@@We have seen it.@@@We have lived it and participated in it.@@@This is our institution, and it is a system that has real value.@@@My country is proud to hold the longest unbroken record of service in United Nations peacekeeping missions.@@@We are proud that the women and men of the Irish Defence Forces who work to protect civilians and sustain peace around the world — in United Nations-.@@@European Union- and NATO-led missions — operate with the mandate of the Organization.@@@Some have paid the ultimate price.@@@We remember today in particular Private Sean Rooney, who was killed in Lebanon while serving in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon last December.@@@We think, too, of his family and his comrades, and of all the women and men who have lost their lives in the pursuit of peace.@@@No one can doubt the need for the United Nations and the multilateral system to be reformed.@@@Ireland fully backs the Secretary-General’s Our Common Agenda (A/75/982) process.@@@We have contributed ideas and have listened to those of others.@@@Our Common Agenda can be successful only if we collectively make it so, and I urge the Secretary-General to keep our ambition high and to challenge us as Member States as we prepare for the Summit of the Future next September.@@@As members may be aware, this year also marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement, the agreement that helped secure peace and power-sharing in Northern Ireland.@@@It was the culmination of years of brave political and civil leadership in Northern Ireland, of the Irish and United Kingdom Governments working in partnership, of steadfast backing from friends and partners abroad, and a sustained commitment to peace and a better life by the people of Northern Ireland.@@@An entire generation on the island of Ireland has now grown to adulthood free from the shadow of violence.@@@We know that peace is hard won and can never be taken for granted.@@@We do not presume to know the solutions to the conflicts faced by many nations around the world.@@@But we strongly believe that this body that we all belong to — this body that encapsulates hope and ambition, compromise and dedication — has given us the ability to build peace — a just, lasting and inclusive peace.@@@I begin my remarks by extending, on behalf of the people of Mozambique, our heartfelt condolences to the peoples of Morocco and Libya for the tragedies that have stricken those two sister African countries.@@@I take this opportunity to reiterate the gratitude of the Mozambican people and Government for the unanimous vote in favour of the election of Mozambique as a non-permanent member of the Security Council.@@@Our participation in the Security Council has enabled us to share our experience in peace-building and national reconciliation, thereby contributing to fostering international peace and security.@@@In September 2015, in this very Hall, we adopted the Sustainable Development Goals, which embody the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@As leaders, we committed on behalf of our peoples to reducing poverty in 17 key areas and establishing a new world for all, leaving no one behind.@@@The progress report that we considered yesterday at the high-level political forum shows clearly that the world continues to face various interconnected crises that undermine the delivery of Agenda 2030.@@@Indeed, the coronavirus disease pandemic crisis, natural disasters arising from climate change and armed conflicts, including terrorism and violent extremism, are compelling millions of people to continue living in poverty without adequate food or access to education and health services.@@@While it is true that the adversities I have referred to are a cause for regression in the progress that we had been making in the implementation of Agenda 2030 since 2015, the main reason for the agenda’s lack of success remains the absence of trust and solidarity among those who have a great deal and those who have little or almost nothing at all.@@@Even those who have much, rather than build trust and solidarity, spend their resources by investing in a competition fuelled by mistrust.@@@Therefore.@@@I commend His Excellency Mr. Dennis Francis.@@@President of the General Assembly at this session, for the theme he has suggested to us.@@@“Rebuilding trust and reigniting global solidarity”.@@@It is critical to realizing Agenda 2030 on sustainable development for peace, progress and prosperity for the sustainability of humankind.@@@In my statement.@@@I will try to focus attention on peace and security, counter-terrorism, climate change, energy transition, the blue economy and environmental conservation, in tandem with the theme of this session.@@@On the issue of peace and security, a number of regions of the world, particularly in Africa, are grappling with a vicious circle of armed conflicts and instability.@@@Thousands of precious lives have been lost.@@@The number of refugees and internally displaced persons has increased by more than 50 per cent in the past year alone.@@@Despite multilateral efforts and several peace initiatives undertaken by the Security Council and regional organizations, war is prevailing in Ukraine and other regions and endangering peace, security and the global economy.@@@My own country.@@@Mozambique, experienced cycles of armed conflict, sometimes triggered by forces alien to national interests, but a settlement has been possible only on the basis of constructive dialogue founded on trust and mutual respect.@@@That is how we adopted the new Provincial Decentralization Law now under implementation.@@@In August 2019, we signed the Maputo Accord for Peace and National Reconciliation.@@@In June, we closed the last camp of the Resistencia Nacional Mozambicana, a formerly armed opposition party, marking the conclusion of the disarmament and demobilization phase.@@@The crucial phase to follow is the reintegration of former combatants into society, including the payment of pensions, although that is not provided for by law.@@@I would like to express our gratitude, as this process relies on the support of the United Nations and other multilateral and bilateral partners.@@@While we seek to close one chapter of the peace and national reconciliation process.@@@Mozambique is confronted by the nefarious phenomenon of terrorism, specifically in Cabo Delgado province, in the north of the country.@@@In March, during Mozambique’s rotational presidency of the Security Council, we had the opportunity to share at length our experience of counterterrorism.@@@Our strategy focuses on strengthening combat operations by the Mozambican defence and security forces, with the initial support of the Rwandan contingent and the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Mission in Mozambique.@@@We have been achieving tangible success on the ground, although terrorists continue to sow terror and fear in a sporadic way in isolated villages.@@@With the improvement of safety and tranquillity, populations have been returning in large numbers to their home areas and resuming their normal life.@@@This is a pioneer experience of combining bilateral and multilateral interventions.@@@It is also an example of African problems being solved, first and foremost, by Africans themselves.@@@However, the issue arising is the need for substantial support to those countries that are directly intervening in countering terrorism with us in Mozambique in order to render the ongoing operations sustainable.@@@At this juncture, the challenge is the reconstruction of infrastructure and the consolidation of social cohesion.@@@The relevant activities are being undertaken in the context of the Northern Region Resilience and Integrated Development Programme, which relies on the support of partners.@@@We have also launched an appeal for the solidarity of United Nations Members, another component of our strategy to counter terrorism and address fragilities.@@@Climate change constitutes the main crisis of humankind in this century.@@@That is not a new discovery, which is why so many speeches around this subject essentially repeat themselves.@@@For decades, scientific evidence has shown that our planet is on the verge of climate catastrophe.@@@However, despite the evidence and commitments assumed yearly at various conferences on climate change, the situation has deteriorated.@@@As with many conflicts, the main cause of climate crisis is a lack of trust and solidarity, coupled with the selfishness of some countries.@@@The countries that pollute most continue producing emissions that cause global warming and climate change.@@@The enrichment of those countries comes at the cost of misery for others that contribute less to pollution and are, coincidentally, among the very poorest.@@@As a consequence, heat waves, cyclones, floods, droughts, earthquakes, sea level rise, uncontrolled fire and other extreme phenomena have become increasingly frequent throughout the world.@@@In the case of Mozambique, due to its geographic vulnerability, the country cyclically suffers the devastating impact of natural disasters.@@@The latest, largest cyclones Idai.@@@Kenneth and Freddy claimed hundreds of lives and caused very costly damage and losses to the tune of billions of dollars.@@@So far, we have been able to recover just one-third of the damages recorded.@@@However, support from our partners has been well below the pledges made and our needs.@@@In many cases, when this assistance does arrive, partners prefer to manage the funds outside mechanisms agreed with the Government, causing overlaps in areas or programmes that have little impact on communities.@@@As a consequence, a substantial proportion of funds is spent on capacity-building conferences and bureaucratic issues rather than being allocated to affected people, which once again demonstrates a lack of trust and solidarity.@@@As a way of mitigating the suffering of the people, we have been promoting domestic solutions towards consolidating a disaster management system with the involvement of public and private stakeholders, civil society and local communities, focusing on prevention and adaptation.@@@In this way, we have managed to reduce the impact of natural disasters, a fact that has earned Mozambique recognition from SADC.@@@African Union and United Nations agencies.@@@Energy transition is a global imperative aimed at building more resilient and sustainable societies.@@@However, we advocate that energy transition be fair and work as a launching pad to enable poor countries to find a window of opportunity in the diversification of the energy mix in order to consolidate their economic base.@@@Energy transition requires large investments in power-generation projects from clean sources.@@@Once again, most industrialized countries are invited to show greater solidarity by increasing their climate funds.@@@Mozambique is a regional exemplar for the diversity of its energy matrix, which includes hydropower dams, particularly Cahora Bassa, solar power stations and wind power stations, while the construction of the Mphanda Nkuwa dam is now under way.@@@Last year.@@@Mozambique joined the group of liquefied natural gas producing and exporting countries, an important step towards accelerating energy transition.@@@Currently, the energy sector is dominated by hydropower, with a capacity of 2.172 megawatts; solar, with 95 megawatts; gas, with 441 megawatts; and diesel, with 120 megawatts.@@@The Temane thermal power station has the potential to produce 450 megawatts in the last quarter of 2024, and with a longer maturity cycle, the new Mphanda Nkuwa hydropower station will have the capacity to produce 1.500 megawatts beginning in 2030.@@@Mozambique is also counting on the development of the blue economy to optimize resources from its extensive exclusive economic zone along a coastline of 2.700 kilometres.@@@We are also a country with robust environmental legislation that incorporates major international conventions, including the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the Convention on the Protection of Endangered Species, among others.@@@In the framework of nationally determined commitments, in 2021 Mozambique became the first African country to receive payments from the World Bank trust fund to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation.@@@Last year, we launched a regional initiative on the sustainable management of the Miombo forest that culminated with the adoption of the Maputo Declaration, which was endorsed by eleven SADC member States.@@@The Miombo woodland is the largest tropical forest ecosystem in the world, where three species are predominant and which covers more than 2.574 kilometres along the great Zambezi basin across eight countries of Africa.@@@With regard to that initiative to protect nature, we count on the support of bilateral and multilateral partners in the conservation of the Miombo forest, which can contribute significantly to capturing carbon on the planet.@@@The challenges currently faced by humankind are huge.@@@However, solutions are within our reach.@@@We, the leaders present here, have the historic responsibility to save the planet for the benefit of future generations.@@@The priority areas requiring urgent action are clearly identified, with a matrix of pre-defined solutions, of which we highlight three.@@@First, we need to renew our political will and redouble our efforts to accelerate the achievement of targets of the Agenda 2030.@@@We do not need to come up with analytical speeches; the most important thing is that we all act together with vigour and using available resources.@@@Secondly, we have to intensify integrated policies with concrete actions to eradicate poverty, reduce inequalities and preserve nature by empowering women, youth and other vulnerable groups.@@@Thirdly, we must strengthen international partnership and multilateralism, taking the United Nations system as a basis.@@@However.@@@78 years after its creation, the world has experienced profound transformations that require deep reforms.@@@I conclude by appealing for the establishment of a more inclusive international financial system, guided by transparent rules and mutually beneficial, in which Africa participates as a partner that has also lot to offer to the world and not only as a warehouse that supplies cheap commodities to countries or international multinational corporations that dominate the international market.@@@To that end, we need to revive trust and mutual respect among States, which are the sacred principles of the Charter of the United Nations.@@@It is only with trust and mutual respect that we can build a better world, a world of peace, safe and sustainable, that delivers welfare for all.@@@In the General Assembly and other global forums we hear many words spoken about the challenges we face, from the growing intensity of armed conflicts to the devastating effects of climate change.@@@We discuss the task of providing for a growing global population with limited resources and overexploited ecosystems.@@@We debate the opportunities of emerging technologies that can transform our lives but can also trigger the destruction of our democratic way of life.@@@Those challenges have one common denominator.@@@They are human-made, and it therefore falls to us to deliver human-made solutions.@@@The time for talking, discussion and promises is over.@@@The Assembly must start by working for the ultimate purpose for which the United Nations was founded — the restoration of peace.@@@Last year we recorded more conflict-related deaths in the world than in any year since 1994.@@@Russia’s illegal full-scale invasion of Ukraine, an immediate neighbour of Slovakia, has greatly contributed to that rise.@@@For more than 570 days.@@@Russia’s forces have been killing innocent Ukrainian civilians, kidnapping children and destroying towns and cities.@@@They have bombed infrastructure and ports that export Ukraine’s grain to people who need it in Bangladesh and Egypt.@@@That is why Moscow must let that grain leave Ukrainian ports.@@@We do indeed need a New Agenda for Peace, as the Secretary-General rightly said, but first and foremost we need action for peace from Russia, a permanent member of the Security Council.@@@The Climate Ambition Summit starts today.@@@But when it comes to our planet, the time for action is running out.@@@Our cities are becoming warmer, our oceans more acidic and our lands more arid.@@@That is a result of human-caused climate change.@@@This summer gave us another preview of what we can expect if we sit on our hands.@@@In scientific report after report, we see the same conclusion — we are not doing enough.@@@The current pace of our reduction of greenhouse-gas emissions and our mitigation measures is not sufficient to prevent a 1.5°C rise in the global temperature by 2100.@@@Globally, our emissions still exceed the levels we agreed on in the Paris Agreement.@@@We can still prevent the worst-case scenarios.@@@Global emissions must peak before 2030.@@@That is seven years from now, and it is our responsibility, not that of the Governments that will come after us.@@@If we are to see results seven years from now, we must all act today.@@@Let us turn that ambition into our joint and global commitment.@@@Feasible, effective and low-cost options for mitigation and adaptation are already available.@@@They can speed up our green transition.@@@In Slovakia, we are doing our share.@@@Eighty-five per cent of our electricity is already produced with zero emissions.@@@In the next seven years, we will use 5 per 
cent of our gross domestic product to decarbonize our economy and increase the use of renewables.@@@In 2030, our emissions will be 55 per cent lower than in 1990.@@@Europe may be warming twice as fast as any other continent, but Africa, while responsible for less than 4 per cent of global emissions, is the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change.@@@Working together as partners, we can solve that challenge.@@@The green technologic s that already exist must be made available to everyone.@@@Slovakia will continue to meet its obligations under the global climate finance commitments.@@@My final point about climate change is simple.@@@But we need to wake up.@@@We are not battling an external threat.@@@This is not a meteor heading for Earth.@@@It is an existential crisis that we ourselves have created, and we alone must solve it.@@@These crises are hitting hardest those who are least responsible for their creation — vulnerable populations, women and children and the world’s poorest peoples.@@@We cannot achieve peace and prosperity if they are excluded.@@@We have been acknowledging that women’s rights are human rights for decades.@@@It is time to turn those words into action.@@@Our collective wealth can enable us to provide dignified conditions for everyone on the planet.@@@But today, halfway to 2030, only 12 per cent of the Sustainable Development Goals are on track.@@@Those targets are not advisory guidelines.@@@They are benchmarks for creating a world built on fairness, equity and stability.@@@Seventy-five years ago, we adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.@@@Human dignity, freedom and justice must be universally protected.@@@That is even more important today, when new technologies promise to unlock huge potential in areas such as public health, connectivity and addressing climate change.@@@However, technological progress sometimes moves faster than human minds and emotions can evolve.@@@The rapid rise of social media platforms and the related flood of disinformation and hate speech prove that.@@@Platforms have removed barriers across the globe, linking people as never before, but they have also destroyed barriers that protected others’ rights and integrity.@@@Any technology must be used with one goal in mind — ensuring the dignity and rights of every individual.@@@If these issues are not addressed, social media platforms, artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies can act like steroids on our current crises.@@@That is why we cannot postpone their democratic regulation.@@@Facts and science are essential to overcoming our global challenges.@@@The coronavirus disease pandemic illustrated that well.@@@Disinformation is undermining our efforts to build consensus and a common vision.@@@If humankind continues to build alternative truths and we continue to distrust one another, we will never be able to take the action we need to address these universal challenges.@@@In my final words.@@@I would like to leave the Assembly with a message of hope.@@@When I meet with young people in Slovakia.@@@I am left with a feeling of great optimism for the future.@@@Data shows that equality is the most important societal value for them.@@@We should listen to our children and work to achieve a vision of humankind where equality is the rule, not the exception, where development can be sustainable and climate-resilient and where we can live in peace.@@@They are looking to us to take action.@@@The cost of our joint failure is not an abstraction.@@@It will be counted in concrete deaths, displacement, injustice and the loss of species and ecosystems.@@@We politicians are often asked about our legacy.@@@Should this be our legacy?@@@For me the choice is clear, and our response should be clear as well.@@@On behalf of Mexico, please accept our warmest congratulations.@@@Sir, on your election as President.@@@Latin America and the Caribbean feel wholly represented under your presidency, which is a sign of the commitment of our region to the aims of this Organization.@@@Today the United Nations faces a challenge of huge proportions in order to fulfil the essence of its mandate: to protect humankind from the scourge of war, promote and uphold all human rights, ensure the effectiveness of international law and promote human well-being through environmental sustainability.@@@I am deeply moved to return to the Headquarters of the United Nations, which I served with pride for decades, this time as the representative of the Government of my country.@@@Mexico.@@@It is a great honour.@@@Today Mexico is going through a process of profound and forward-looking changes.@@@I am honoured to speak on behalf of Mexico and to represent it at the global level.@@@I deliver the greetings of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.@@@Our peoples are facing grave threats to international peace and security.@@@Those threats include the more than 50 active armed conflicts in the world; the proliferation of nuclear weapons; the escalation of multiple crises, ranging from humanitarian to climatic; the forced migration of millions of people; the highest increase in inequality and poverty, with 165 million people falling into poverty in the past three years; and the challenge posed by health and the risk of new pandemics, all against a backdrop of growing scepticism about the relevance of multilateralism and its institutions.@@@However, there is no doubt that our international action loses legitimacy when our resolutions do not translate into tangible benefits for people, for the planet or for prosperity.@@@According to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, urgent action is required in order to rescue the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@The pandemic has inhibited progress towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).@@@But the pre-pandemic trajectory was not encouraging, and the current context of macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty calls for ambitious and immediate action.@@@Indeed, the stagnation in achieving 
the SDGs is not an abstract metric.@@@We are talking about hundreds of millions of people who live in poverty, children facing food insecurity and an environment in crisis.@@@The future of people and the planet does not depend on chance; it depends on the political decisions and actions we take, guided by the 2030 Agenda.@@@Inequality is the great challenge, because poverty reduction is not enough.@@@What is required is a different development paradigm that redistributes power and wealth and closes the unacceptable gaps and asymmetries that exist between rich and poor people and among countries.@@@Equality is not just about being rights holders; inequality is economically inefficient — hence the need to level the playing field in order to grow and the need to grow in order to level the playing field.@@@We are no longer in an era of change; we are in a veritable change of eras, and that requires rethinking development and making equality central.@@@At both the national and international levels, the achievement of the SDGs hinges on a vision of social justice and solidarity, which certainly includes the mobilization of the necessary financial resources and the urgent reform of the international financial system.@@@In that complex context.@@@Mexico will continue to draw strength and inspiration from the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations; because in the institutional framework that we built nearly 80 years ago, we have harnessed international cooperation, and Mexico has spearheaded and will continue to propose initiatives that aim to improve the lives of present and future generations, advocating for genuine and lasting peace and security, and a sustainable development that is egalitarian, resilient and inclusive, with full and unconditional respect for human rights.@@@The desire for transformation and the work of our Government has focused precisely on transforming the development model to build more and better public goods, and on guaranteeing rights with fiscal responsibility, anchored in a basic premise: “for the common good, the poor must come first”.@@@Our Government has demonstrated that it is urgent to restore the role of the State, to regulate the relations among the market, the State and society, and to implement transformative structural policies.@@@The aim is to give our people hope again, the hope of a fairer, more egalitarian country so that no one is left behind and no one is left out.@@@In that connection.@@@5.1 million people have been lifted out of poverty in recent years.@@@We witnessed the largest increase in the minimum wage in our history and developed an elaborate network of social programmes that extend rights to the entire population.@@@However, we aspire to a vision of equality among all nations, in which the gaps and asymmetries among countries are bridged.@@@We are committed to eliminating the culture of privileges — privileges that deny rights.@@@Mexico reiterates the importance of environmental sustainability as a strategic part of development and not as an afterthought, as well as the relevance of moving towards green and blue industrial and production policies that create jobs and reduce the environmental footprint, but that also incorporate the contribution and complexity of ecosystems and their services into the economy and well-being.@@@We are taking decisive steps to implement the Regional Agreement on Access to Information.@@@Public Participation and Justice in Environmental Matters in Latin America and the Caribbean and the defence of the defenders of the environment, those who are willing to give their lives for life.@@@We signed the Agreement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas beyond National Jurisdiction and hope that it will enter into force soon.@@@In the words of Nicholas Stern, climate change is a result of the greatest market failure the world has seen, and today it is one of the greatest global risks.@@@Estimates of the costs incurred by its effects show that it will affect not only economic growth but also the most vulnerable sectors.@@@We reiterate our commitment to moving forward with the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, but underscore the importance of financing to address climate change and prioritize adaptation, especially with a view to supporting the most vulnerable nations, starting with the Caribbean in our region.@@@In addition to the current session of the General Assembly.@@@Mexico has participated in the SDG Summit, the High-level Dialogue on Financing for Development, the Climate Action Summit and the preparatory meeting for the Summit of the Future.@@@We advocate a thorough reform of the international financial architecture, which should address the profound inequalities between countries and prioritize the provision of assistance to highly indebted countries with new instruments, redistributing special drawing rights to expand the fiscal space of developing countries or debt relief in 
exchange for environmental services.@@@We join the Bridgetown 2.0 initiative proposed by Barbados.@@@Latin America and the Caribbean learned a very hard lesson during the pandemic owing to the lack of global solidarity, and today our most urgent need is to promote, through the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC), such initiatives as the Plan for Self-sufficiency on Health Matters for Latin America and the Caribbean, the Regional Medicines Agency for Latin America and the Caribbean, and the Fund for Climate Adaptation.@@@In that regard, we support Ralph Gonsalves as President of CELAC.@@@Mexico is seeking to reach agreements on all issues on the multilateral agenda, because we are interested in bringing positions closer together without excluding anyone.@@@However, we live in unprecedented times that require the sum total of more wills to give a voice to all the peoples of the global South, to which Mexico belongs by virtue of its history and its convictions.@@@Mexico is therefore considering participation in the discussions and endeavours of the Group of 77 and China, on issues and in forums in which we can help strengthen the negotiating position of the global South.@@@We will soon submit a proposal to the Group of 77 and China for their consideration.@@@I would like to reaffirm before the General Assembly Mexico’s long-standing commitment to prioritizing dialogue and understanding in order to promote peace and the peaceful settlement of disputes.@@@It is a commitment that is informed by our deepest convictions concerning the resolute defence of humankind’s most important causes.@@@In our region, we serve as a guarantor country for the panel for peace talks between the Government of the Republic of Colombia and the Ejercito de Liberacion Nacional.@@@We are also working to seek solutions for political dialogue in Venezuela, while always adhering to our constitutional principles of respect for the self-determination of peoples, the peaceful settlement of disputes and non-intervention.@@@Mexico is hosting negotiations between the Venezuelan Government and the Plataforma Unitaria de Venezuela, facilitated by Norway.@@@We support the implementation of the agreements signed in November 2022 in Mexico City and keep our doors open to resume the process in order to reach a solution that benefits the entire Venezuelan people.@@@With regard to the conflict between Ukraine and Russia, our position is clear: we condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine because it is in violation of the Charter of the United Nations and international law and because of the unspeakable suffering of millions of people, especially children.@@@We recognize that every sovereign State has the right to have the means to regain its territorial integrity, but it is equally true that, with each passing day, the arms race is taking us farther away from a peaceful solution.@@@We must stop speaking of war and start speaking of peace.@@@Mexico will continue to fight for disarmament and the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, as set forth in the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean and the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, essential for preventing and eliminating catastrophic humanitarian consequences.@@@We and the General Assembly have spoken out against a major threat that runs counter to international law.@@@We emphatically reject the illicit trafficking of firearms.@@@Allow me simply to share a statistic — each year 200.000 firearms are trafficked into Mexico from our neighbour to the north, which then fall into the hands of organized crime, claiming countless lives.@@@That is the other side of the drug issue.@@@Mexico is fulfilling its commitments to combat drug trafficking in good faith, but any effort will be limited if the countries of manufacture and origin of such weapons do not assume their responsibility to combat this scourge.@@@We need strong measures to reduce the widespread availability of firearms.@@@Companies, manufacturers and distributors must act responsibly and take diligent measures to prevent arms from being diverted to the illicit market.@@@In our region.@@@Latin America and the Caribbean, we are devastated by the situation in Haiti, a country drowning in gang violence that thrives, in large measure, because of illicit arms trafficking, despite the sanctions regime established by the Security Council in resolution 2653 (2022), facilitated by Mexico.@@@We hope that the Security Council will very soon adopt the relevant resolution so that the international community can act decisively to help Haiti regain its stability.@@@We take this opportunity to renew Mexico’s commitment to the two-State solution — Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace and with secure borders.@@@We also recognize the right of the people of Israel, but not at the expense of the Palestinian people.@@@Let us put an end to aberrant situations, such as Cuba’s suffering under the continuing economic 
embargo, which is totally unjustified, contrary to international law and foreign to the prevailing values and peaceful coexistence among the countries of Latin America.@@@We demand that Cuba cease to be considered as a country that sponsors or encourages terrorism.@@@Sixty-four years ago, the General Assembly was presided over by one of Mexico’s greatest diplomats.@@@Luis Padilla Nervo, who said:
“Victory will not be decided on the battlefields, but in the consciences of men and women because of the nature of this struggle.@@@The best weapons of democracies are moral principles, scrupulous respect for treaties and the principle that the difficulties and controversies of countries should not be resolved by arms, but by negotiation.”@@@Mexico aspires to be an actor that promotes peace through law.@@@We will do everything in our power to support the genuine efforts of parties to conflict to engage in dialogue that leads to a peaceful solution, because, as our famous diplomat Genaro Estrada once said, “foreign policy is based on renouncing war as an instrument of international policy”, which is the basis for Mexico’s foreign policy.@@@That is why, in the entrance hall to the General Assembly, there is a piece of obsidian — a sacred stone that the Aztecs called “Itztli”, convinced that its origin was the result of lightning striking the rocks of volcanoes, a synthesis of the celestial and the terrestrial.@@@That piece bears an engraved plaque that defines the foundation of our diplomacy.@@@That phrase was pronounced 156 years ago by the first indigenous president of Latin America.@@@Benito Juarez:
“Among individuals, as among nations, respect for the rights of others is peace”.@@@With that humanist vision.@@@Mexico faces the great challenge of human mobility.@@@Geography has placed us, inescapably, in a very complicated place, but Mexico has a very clear compass — to humanize migration, which should be an option, not an obligation.@@@When people migrate, they should do so in a safe, orderly and regular manner.@@@This unprecedented level of migration concerns the international community as a whole.@@@Mexico therefore insists on the urgency of addressing the structural and deep-rooted causes of migration.@@@We reaffirm the importance of supporting the communities of origin and to pool the necessary will and resources to do so.@@@That requires the support and contribution of all countries, especially the host countries that benefit from the work and contributions of migrants.@@@For example, here in the United States, our migrants contribute more than $500 million in taxes.@@@It is essential that we evolve towards models of migration management that offer safe and legal opportunities for work and financial integration that facilitate absorption into host societies.@@@Those models must protect the human rights of migrants throughout the migration cycle.@@@As the Secretary-General rightly pointed out, now.@@@75 years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, it is time to put an end to the persecution and demonization of migrants.@@@In that regard, we cannot accept calling into question the progressive nature of international standards on gender equality and respect for sexual diversity, which we have worked so hard to build.@@@We call for advancing gender equality and avoiding setbacks, through forceful and innovative actions — nothing about us without us.@@@Mexico was the first country in the South to announce a feminist foreign policy because we are determined to transform the structures that prevent women from advancing and fully enjoying their rights and autonomy.@@@That implies promoting their substantive participation in decision-making and mainstreaming a gender perspective in all spaces, forums, organizations and international agreements.@@@Every time we break a glass ceiling, our civilization progresses.@@@The theme of this seventy-eighth General Assembly is relevant and precise — to rebuild trust and to reignite global solidarity.@@@That must be the focus of our efforts.@@@The majestic space in which we are gathered must not make us forget the crisis of confidence facing international institutions and, in particular, the United Nations.@@@Our debates must be reflected in concrete results, which is critical because we must include the citizens we represent as active subjects.@@@And we must be very vigilant because multilateralism must not lose its way in polarization and geopolitical rivalries.@@@If the United Nations fails to deliver on its peace and development mandate, we will fuel dissatisfaction and disarray, and the international institutions we have built will suffer.@@@We stand for a multilateralism that is close to the people, timely and effective and committed to providing 
global public goods.@@@We stand for the collective good, for the good of all.@@@Multilateralism is a tool for development, and the work of the United Nations must create a just peace, expand freedoms, build equality, deepen democracy and ultimately, create hope.@@@Political commitment is key to moving towards a new multilateralism that enables us to restructure international economic and social power relations where development issues create spaces to counter the exclusive and excessive emphasis on mercantilist neoliberalism.@@@We hope that this same vision will prevail among nations in order to achieve a fairer world, with fewer asymmetries.@@@We propose a multilateralism that is closer to the needs of the people, consistent with the purposes and principles of the United Nations, forceful, timely and effective.@@@That is because the challenges we face are enormous.@@@On the table is nothing less than uncertainty about our survival.@@@There is no time for gradual measures, which are sometimes merely excuses for maintaining the status quo.@@@The current model of global development is unsustainable.@@@The promise of inevitable and unlimited progress has run up against the unyielding wall of nature.@@@Just around the corner is 2030, and the minimum essential targets that we set in 2015 are not being reached.@@@We must therefore spread rebellion and a sense of urgency amongst ourselves.@@@It is on the shoulders of this generation and its leaders that the responsibility to stop the disaster that science has described falls squarely.@@@And it will not be by taking baby steps that we will do it, it will not be with a modest timidity that tries, discreetly, not to upset the power structure that has brought us to this point.@@@It will be with bold and courageous leaps.@@@It will be with the courage to call for and make an egalitarian and just world in which rights are not commodities and nature is not the inevitable victim of our production and consumption patterns — because the obscene concentration of wealth and its destructive influence on the distribution of power are not compatible with the human enterprise.@@@We established our Organization 78 years ago, terrified of the precipice confronting us as we contemplated the possibility of all of us succumbing to the flames of war.@@@Today that same precipice is getting closer — frightening, real and possibly more ferocious.@@@That is why our efforts must be equal to the moment.@@@In the mid-twentieth century, this Organization was just finding its feet, when the devastating impacts of the Second World War were still fresh.@@@And a young Mexican diplomat was drafting the paragraphs of a landmark essay on my country’s national identity.@@@Those paragraphs would be entitled The Labyrinth of Solitude, and its author would later win the Nobel Prize in Literature in recognition of his universal work.@@@He was Octavio Paz, and I would like to conclude this statement by quoting his lines from that time.@@@He said.@@@“We console ourselves by saying that everything has happened as it should not have happened.@@@But it is we who are mistaken, not history.@@@We must learn to look reality in the face; if necessary, we must invent new words and new ideas for these new and strange realities that have come our way ...@@@We live, as the rest of the planet does, at a decisive and deadly juncture — orphans of the past and with a future to be invented.@@@Universal history is now a common task, and our labyrinth is the labyrinth of all men [and women]”.@@@And for that task — to guarantee succeeding generations a possible world and a possible life, and to get out of the labyrinth together — the Assembly can count today and always on Mexico’s fraternal and committed will.@@@It is with great pride that I stand once more before the General Assembly of the United Nations to represent the Republic of Moldova — a country on the front line of the fight for democracy.@@@Mr. Milambo (Zambia), Vice-President, took the Chair.@@@Today Moldova stands stronger and more resilient than one year ago.@@@We stand firm in our belief in a democratic future.@@@And we stand firm with Ukraine as our neighbour continues to resist Russia’s brutal invasion — an attack on its sovereignty and way of life.@@@We stand firmly for Ukraine’s victory because when Ukraine wins the free world wins.@@@Now more than ever, support for Ukraine must not diminish.@@@Please continue supporting Ukraine.
Ukraine.@@@Moldova.@@@Europe and the free world are facing an external assault on our values.@@@But countries like mine have not broken free from imperial chains only to be brought back into servitude.@@@We push forward.@@@Unlike our Ukrainian friends and neighbours, we are not facing an imminent military threat, but every day we are countering Russia’s hybrid assault.@@@Russia has teamed up with corrupt crooks to destabilize us.@@@Their hybrid toolbox includes energy blackmail, support for separatism, cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns.@@@They also tried to overthrow our democratically elected Government, but each time they have failed.@@@We know they will try again.@@@In soon-to-be-held elections, they will attempt to undermine our citizens’ ability to make their own democratic choices.@@@That threat is not unique to us.@@@Many countries in Europe and beyond our continent are feeling the sting of foreign interference in their democratic processes.@@@That hybrid assault is conducted by those who oppose not just our democracy but all liberal democracies.@@@We must stay vigilant, and we must stand united.@@@Against all odds, we have preserved peace across all of Moldova, including in the breakaway Transnistrian region, where Russian troops are stationed illegally and where concerns about human rights violations are deeply worrisome.@@@Our commitment to a peaceful resolution remains steadfast, and I call here today for the unconditional withdrawal of those Russian forces.@@@In the light of intertwined challenges, building Moldova’s resilience has not been an easy task.@@@Yet we take heart in the fact that Moldova is not alone.@@@Our friends and partners — the entire free world — stand with us.@@@Building resilience means that Moldova has moved from relying solely on Russian gas to having a mix of energy sources and backup storage.@@@We are also building electricity lines to Europe, investing in energy efficiency and pursuing renewable sources.@@@The true measure of a democracy’s success is its capacity to deliver a better life and real economic benefits to its citizens.@@@Strengthening our economy as the war rages across the border is a daunting challenge, but we are determined.@@@Small and medium-sized enterprises can now access funds to grow, digital public services are helping to cut red tape and the European Union market is open to exports of our fruit and vegetables.@@@Inflation is down to 10 per cent, from a peak of 35 per cent last October.@@@A major ratings agency has upgraded our outlook to stable.@@@We are comprehensively reforming the justice system and redoubling our efforts to defeat corruption and organized crime.@@@Part of that effort involves reducing the malign influence of fugitive oligarchs who at one time held our State hostage.@@@I am grateful to many in this Hall for imposing sanctions on those individuals.@@@The next critical step in that journey is to ensure that the stolen money is returned to the Moldovan people.@@@As evidence of our commitment, on corruption perceptions, as measured by Transparency International, we improved by 24 places in the past two years, our best score in a decade.@@@On the World Justice Project Rule of Law Index, we have climbed 14 places since 2020.@@@Greater resilience will also come about through enhanced transport links with Europe, which are vitally important given Russia’s blockade of Ukrainian ports and the disruption of trade routes.@@@We are upgrading roads and railways, and that modernized infrastructure will not only boost our trade and create jobs but also support solidarity lanes for Ukraine, ensuring that its grain reaches the regions where it is needed most, and one day those very connections will aid Ukraine’s postwar reconstruction.@@@As we build up defences and resilience.@@@Moldova is increasingly recognized as a contributor to regional security, a strong neighbour to Ukraine and a partner of the European Union in countering security challenges.@@@However, our commitment extends globally:@@@Moldovan servicemen actively contribute to peacekeeping missions, including most recently in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon.@@@Underscoring our commitment to the security of our continent, we hosted the European Political Community summit in June — a summit that further cemented our place in the European family.@@@Achieving economic progress, improving security and reinforcing our democracy are part of our journey towards membership in the European Union.@@@Moldova’s European aspirations have long been well known.@@@In May.@@@100.000 Moldovans rallied in Chisinau to reassert their commitment to democracy — and to European Union membership.@@@Let me be clear: Moldova’s European Union membership is not just a political choice; it is the only way to protect our liberty, peace and democracy.@@@The enlargement of the European Union is the sole path to ensuring that our neighbourhood stays anchored in the free world and that we deliver better lives for our citizens.@@@It will also demonstrate the European Union’s commitment to peace — the very reason the European Union was built.@@@When it comes to membership, we believe in a fair and merit-driven process, and we have been doing our homework diligently.@@@With that in mind.@@@I call on the European Commission and all European Union members to support us.@@@I extend this call beyond European Union borders to all the countries of the free world, especially those with well-established, robust democracies that have long reaped its benefits and understand its worth.@@@The success or downfall of one democracy resonates globally.@@@When one thrives, it inspires hope in others; when one falters, it threatens to unleash a domino effect.@@@Today the fight for democracy anywhere is a fight for democracy everywhere, and in this interlinked fight for democracy we will prevail.@@@I congratulate the President and the members of the Bureau on their respective elections.@@@I also express my deep appreciation to the Secretary- General.@@@Mr. Antonio Guterres, for his unremitting efforts to strengthen the United Nations and promote the cause of multilateralism.@@@There could be no better time to deliberate on the theme of rebuilding trust reigniting global solidarity, particularly when trust and cooperation are in short supply and crises of confidence rule the world.@@@Today, due to the resurgence of geopolitical competition, power polarization and economic nationalism, the maintenance of world peace and security, the foremost goal of the Charter of the United Nations, has come under serious strain.@@@Spending on arms is on the rise, but resources for the realization of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development have become scarce.@@@We must correct that course and focus on our common goals of peace, prosperity and progress.@@@It is time to build trust, promote partnership and 
collaboration and work in solidarity as the world faces challenges of an unprecedented scale and nature.@@@I have fond memories of addressing this Assembly back in 2008 (see A/63/PV.11) as the Prime Minister of a country that had just made a transformation of historic proportions — one from armed conflict to an inclusive and nationally owned peace process; from centuries- old feudal monarchical rule to a democratic republican order; and from a multiparty democratic polity where participation of all sections of our society is ensured.@@@Fifteen years on, we have come a long way.@@@We successfully transitioned through a nationally led peace process.@@@In 2015, an elected constituent assembly promulgated a democratic Constitution, which consolidated the universally recognized values of human rights, participatory democracy, periodic elections, inclusive proportional representation, full freedom of the press, an independent judiciary and the rule of law.@@@The successive two cycles of federal, provincial and local elections have resulted in the increased participation of women.@@@Dalits, youths and underrepresented communities at all levels of governance.@@@We have been able to ensure a 41 per cent representation of women in local assemblies, whereas a minimum 33 per cent is constitutionally guaranteed in the provincial assemblies and Federal Parliament.@@@We have firmly established that our sovereignty lies in Nepali people, who are the real source of State power.@@@We are now closer to logically concluding our unique, nationally owned and homegrown peace process.@@@Completing the remaining task of transitional justice is top on my political agenda.@@@As Prime Minister and a co-signatory of the Comprehensive Peace Accord.@@@I have been making serious efforts to bridge the gaps and build consensus among the key stakeholders.@@@An amendment bill related to transitional justice has been submitted in the Federal Parliament to address the concerns of the victims, strike a right balance between peace, justice and reparation and ensure that the transitional justice process is broadly owned by our society.@@@The proposed bill, evolved through a wider consultative process, takes a victim-centred approach and recognizes reparation as a victim’s right.@@@In the process, there will be no blanket amnesty for serious violation of human rights.@@@The ultimate objective is to establish enduring peace in the country and foster harmony in society through peace, justice and reconciliation.@@@I appeal to the international community for their goodwill and support of the conclusion of the final leg of our peace process and call on them to duly recognize this rare example of successful conflict transformation.@@@As Nepal’s political course has taken a stable shape, our focus is now on the agenda of economic transformation.@@@We are aware that political achievements can be sustained only by socioeconomic growth and development.@@@It is not least in this light that the central focus of the current Government is on mobilizing all its energy and resources to accelerate development works and ensure good governance.@@@We are graduating from the least developed countries (LDCs) status by 2026; and we are committed to making our graduation smooth, sustainable and irreversible.@@@We are currently in the process of finalizing the smooth transition strategy of graduation.@@@We have put Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at the centre of our development vision and priorities.@@@However, crises such as the coronavirus disease pandemic, climate change and heightened geopolitical competition have threatened our hard-earned progress in achieving the SDGs.@@@We therefore call for an enhanced level of international support in the form of development assistance, foreign direct investment, export promotion, special drawing rights allocation, technology transfer and technical assistance.@@@Nepal welcomes the Secretary- General’s call for an increase in SDG financing by $500 billion per year.@@@As the current Chair of the Global Coordination Bureau of the LDCs, we remain actively engaged in collaboration with our fellow LDCs in all relevant forums, including in the United Nations system, to protect and promote our collective interests.@@@We stress the need to mainstream the Doha Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries into all important United Nations processes and development systems and the development cooperation frameworks of our partners.@@@We call for a fair and equitable international trading regime that benefits the LDCs.@@@Coordinated policies aimed at debt relief, debt restructuring and debt swap, as envisaged by the Doha Programme of Action, must be translated into reality.@@@Climate change has assumed a crisis proportion, and the clock is ticking.@@@Our inaction or little action will 
surely invite disastrous consequences for humankind.@@@We must therefore set higher ambitions and commit to achieving those ambitions in a time-bound manner.@@@Climate vulnerable mountainous countries like Nepal have been bearing the severe brunt of climate change.@@@The Himalayas are the source of fresh water for over 2 billion people.@@@Global warming has induced the rapid receding of ice in our Himalayas.@@@It has not only eroded the health of our mountains but also endangered the lives and livelihoods of millions of people living downstream.@@@The human and financial toll due to floods, droughts and other extreme climate-induced events is terrifying.@@@On our part, we remain fully committed to the effective implementation of the Paris Agreement and achieving its goals.@@@Nepal has set an ambitious target of reaching a net-zero scenario by 2045.@@@We have already submitted our updated nationally determined contribution and aligned our national policies and plans with it.@@@Our priorities include conserving and sustainably managing land, forest and water resources, undertaking effective adaptation and mitigation measures and promoting a green and resilient economy.@@@To that end, we are working to ensure access to clean energy for all citizens.@@@Easy access to climate finance will be the key to low-carbon and climate-resilient development pathways.@@@The early operationalization of the loss and damage fund is equally crucial, as well as fulfilling the target of the $100 billion commitment and doubling adaptation climate finance.@@@It is an irony that my country.@@@Nepal — 45 per cent of whose area is richly biodiverse forest and 15 per cent high mountains — releases far less in terms of greenhouse-gas emissions while contributing significantly to ecological preservation, and yet has suffered unfairly from the climate crisis.@@@That kind of mismatch must be addressed through a compensation mechanism to the countries that make a positive contribution to the greening of the planet.@@@It is distressing that conflicts within and between countries are increasing.@@@Nepal opposes any use or threat of use of force against the territorial integrity, political independence and sovereignty of any country.@@@The people of Libya.@@@Syria and Yemen continue to bear the brunt of protracted conflicts, and their suffering must end.@@@We believe that the United Nations-brokered truce in Yemen must be allowed to transition to a sustained peace.@@@The protracted stalemate in Libya must give way to peace and reconciliation.@@@The Palestinian people deserve peace and an end to their prolonged conflict.@@@Nepal reiterates its support for a two-State solution with Israel and Palestine, living peacefully side by side, within internationally recognized borders based on the relevant United Nations resolutions.@@@We continue to support nationally owned, peaceful, just and lasting solutions to conflicts around the world.@@@Peace founded on inclusion, empowerment, economic prosperity and justice has a much better chance of lasting longer.@@@The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction continues to threaten peace and security in the world.@@@The continuing stockpiling of nuclear arsenals, a growing arms race and ever-increasing military expenditure are worrisome.@@@Nepal reiterates its call for the total and time-bound disarmament of all weapons of mass destruction, including biological, chemical, nuclear and radiological weapons.@@@As the host country to the United Nations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Asia and the Pacific.@@@Nepal believes that regional processes, including the Kathmandu process, reinforce the global disarmament regime.@@@The vacuum in international governance on cyberspace and artificial intelligence demands multilateral regulation.@@@The potential dual uses of artificial intelligence call for urgent, informed deliberations on preventing its potential misuse and strengthening international cooperation.@@@Nepal also condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, and we call for the conclusion of a comprehensive global treaty against terrorism as soon as possible.@@@Nepal’s commitment to the protection and promotion of human rights is total and unflinching.@@@We believe in an integrated approach to democracy, development and human rights.@@@Nepal attaches great importance to ensuring the safety, security, dignity and well-being of migrant workers, and we call for effectively implementing the Global Compact for Safe.@@@Orderly and Regular Migration in order to ensure that migration works for all.@@@The Panchsheel principles, non-alignment, the Charter of the United Nations, international law and the norms of world peace continue to guide Nepal’s foreign policy.@@@Amity, cordiality and fraternity make up the underlying ethos of our international engagements.@@@We want to promote relations with our neighbours and all other friendly countries on a basis of sovereign equality, non-interference and mutual respect.@@@We remain steadfast in our commitment to multilateralism, with the United Nations at its centre.@@@True to its 
commitment.@@@Nepal has continued to contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security through its consistent participation in United Nations-mandated peacekeeping operations for the past 65 years.@@@As what is currently the world’s second-largest troop- and police-contributing country, we have always deployed our peacekeepers in response to every call and without any caveats, even in the most challenging situations.@@@Our peacekeepers have earned a particular reputation for dedication, professionalism and competence, which has been widely acknowledged by the United Nations and host Governments and societies alike.@@@We reiterate our call for ensuring a fair share of leadership positions at Headquarters and in the field for the troop- and police-contributing countries.@@@We know that today’s global governance architecture largely reflects yesterday’s world.@@@Timely reform is essential if our multilateral institutions are to remain relevant and reflect today’s realities.@@@Nepal supports reforming the Security Council with a view to making it more broadly representative, democratic, transparent and accountable.@@@We call for revitalizing the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council in a way that expands the roles of those two vital organs.@@@We need an inclusive and effective multilateralism that can better respond to and deliver on the needs of the people and the planet.@@@Structural reform of the international financial architecture is long overdue.@@@The voices of countries in special situations, including least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States, must be heard and their meaningful representation ensured.@@@Only a more democratic, inclusive, fair and representative international financial architecture can be an antidote to our deep-rooted inequities and gaps.@@@In conclusion, it is our collective responsibility to establish peace and prosperity for everyone, everywhere, and to ensure that no one is left behind.@@@I am pleased to be here in this Assembly, which brings us together for the purpose of finding more effective ways to address the pressing problems of global society.@@@The Republic of Panama, as a founding Member of the organization, reiterates its firm commitment to the search for solutions based on dialogue and mutual respect, which contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security, which are essential for the development and well-being of humankind.@@@Panama is the bridge of the world, a crossroads at the centre of the Americas where all routes converge, thanks to our exceptional air and maritime connectivity, the best in Latin America and the Caribbean.@@@Furthermore, the Republic of Panama is committed to fulfilling the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals, whose guidelines are included in the Government plan of my administration.@@@In 50 months of administration, our Government has focused on the development of public policies that allow us to face the enormous challenge ahead, laying the foundations to reduce poverty and inequality and to provide less-favoured populations the opportunity to achieve social conditions and economic conditions that make it possible for them to live with dignity.@@@Advancing towards the fulfilment of the Sustainable Development Goals is an unavoidable responsibility that compels us to pay attention to the interaction of cause and effect between them.@@@We must ask ourselves: How does the climate crisis impact the first three Sustainable Development Goals?@@@Can we really achieve the end of poverty, zero hunger and health and well-being in the midst of the serious drought that is plaguing the planet, the floods, the devastating fires that devastate immense surfaces and the rise in ocean levels?@@@Let us reflect on the conclusions of the report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which warns us of an unprecedented escalation of changes in the climate system that is leading us into extreme situations that seriously threaten the maintenance of life on the planet.@@@The climate crisis is a ticking time bomb and time is running out for all of us.@@@We have demonstrated Panama’s commitment to human existence in a concrete way with the decisions we make and the consequent actions we take.@@@We are a country of great water wealth; our coasts are washed by two large oceans, which makes us especially aware of the importance of water to our population and to life on Earth.@@@Panama has made an extraordinary effort to preserve our seas, reaching the goal of 30 per cent as a protected area nine years before 2030, and we have even increased our contribution to 54 per cent this year.@@@Panama, without rhetoric but with facts, is a blue leader.@@@I also highlight that Panama is one of the seven countries in the world to have been declared carbon negative.@@@In Panama we have established a carbon footprint reduction programme with a national strategy for green hydrogen and derivatives.@@@Also, during our administration, in Panama we have imposed an ambitious energy transition agenda with the purpose of identifying and developing accessible, non-polluting energy to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions by at least 24 per cent by 2050.@@@Panama is among the 15 countries in the world most exposed to climatic and natural risks.@@@In fact, we have already registered the first case of climate displacement in our territory, when the population of Carti Sugtupu island had to relocate due to the rise in sea level.@@@I want to reaffirm, on behalf of the Republic of Panama, that Panamanians successfully assumed the operation of the Panama Canal in 1999 and expanded its capacity in 2016.@@@I assure the nations of the world that Panama is committed to maintaining the operation of the canal in a safe, efficient, reliable and competitive manner, as we have done until now.@@@Here before the General Assembly.@@@Panama, as a country that contributes effectively to the protection of the environment, asks the most polluting countries to honour the commitments they have made to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions.@@@We have also seen repeatedly, in the meetings of the General Assembly and the Conferences of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, how countries commit to making changes that are later not fulfilled.@@@In the context of human development, it is of the highest priority to provide populations with opportunities for a more dignified life within their own countries.@@@In that way, they would not be forced to leave their countries, emigrating irregularly, exposing themselves to the violation of their human rights and, on many occasions, losing their lives.@@@In that regard, the problem of irregular migration must be addressed at the multilateral level, emphasizing respect for human rights and under the principles of solidarity and shared responsibility, with the purpose of safeguarding the integrity of human life, safely and in an orderly manner.@@@Panama works actively, in cooperation with several countries of the region, in the execution of programmes to improve the care and protection of irregular migrants who enter our country through the border with Colombia, crossing the dangerous Darien jungle, the largest natural park in all of Central America.@@@Our country is making a titanic effort to offer solidarity to those irregular migrants, whose number increases every year, forcing Panama to allocate significant resources to humanitarian relief.@@@This is an unsustainable, unwanted and inhumane situation; a humanitarian tragedy of pain suffering and death for hundreds of thousands of migrants who undertake that risky journey.@@@I repeat, this is an unsustainable situation — a situation in which we are victims and not responsible.@@@I call on the international community to address, in all its magnitude, the problem of irregular migration, which today is not concentrated exclusively in the Mediterranean, but is global in nature and directly impacting Panamanians at this very moment.@@@Today we reiterate the call for dialogue, peace and multilateralism, with respect for international law and the principles that support it, devoid of interests other than the well-being of peoples.@@@In many aspects, we are in a race against time for human survival, which is the raison d’etre of the world body that brings us together and on whose actions the steps we take towards the future, as a world community, largely depend.@@@Today, as head of the Panamanian State.@@@I affirm that Panama wants for the entire world the same thing it wants for its own people: peace, well-being, justice and development.@@@Today’s meeting of the General Assembly is taking place in the context of fundamental changes in our system of international relations.@@@There is a global crisis of confidence.@@@We are experiencing problems with the functioning of security globally and seeing a growing unwillingness to comply with international law, causing huge increases in tension.@@@These geopolitical contradictions are creating new obstacles to the free flow of trade, investment and innovation.@@@Even in areas that concern the fate of humankind as a whole, such as climate change, hunger and inequality, we can feel that mutual communication has been lost.@@@In this complex situation, the notions of preserving a spirit of practical cooperation and interaction, placing our common interests above existing conflicts and strengthening unity among countries are becoming more relevant than ever.@@@Last year we launched the Samarkand Solidarity Initiative, which is aimed at improving our shared security and development.@@@Our main goals are to comprehensively understand our responsibility for the present and future of our countries and peoples and to engage in a global dialogue with all parties that are ready for open and constructive cooperation.@@@I am confident that the Secretary-General’s initiative to hold a Summit of the Future next year will help address the current challenges to international and regional development and increase the influence and effectiveness of our Organization.@@@We remain committed to continuing our policy of creating a new Uzbekistan as a law-governed, secular, democratic and social State.@@@Our country is boldly pursuing a path of fundamental reforms and strengthening the principles of democracy and justice, based on ideals representing humane values and interests.@@@In April, for the first time in the history of Uzbekistan, a nationwide referendum was held on our revised Constitution, which defines the priorities for our national development.@@@More than 90 per cent of the voters in the referendum supported this truly popular Constitution, thereby ensuring that our reforms will indeed be irreversible.@@@In our basic law we have reaffirmed our commitment to the principles of the equality of all citizens, human rights and freedom of speech and conscience, regardless of nationality, language or religion.@@@It is on that legal basis that we have adopted our Uzbekistan 2030 development strategy.@@@It is in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, and we are fulfilling all the commitments we have undertaken.@@@One of the outcomes of our ongoing reforms is that the economy of Uzbekistan, despite the global challenges, is showing steady growth.@@@Over the past six years, the gross domestic product of the country has grown more than one and a half times.@@@Our main objective is to double that figure by 2030.@@@Another priority of our economic liberalization is becoming a full member of the World Trade Organization in the near future.@@@We have halved poverty in our country since 2017, thanks to policies aimed at improving our people’s living standards, and our aim is to reduce poverty rates to 7 per cent by 2030.@@@We also intend to increase by several orders of magnitude the scale of our water supply, health care, education and other social services to the population.@@@We support the Secretary- General’s Global Accelerator on Jobs and Social Protection initiative.@@@In order to share best practices within that framework, in 2024, under the auspices of the United Nations, we propose holding an international conference in Uzbekistan on “Social Protection: The Path towards Development”.@@@In recent years.@@@Uzbekistan has achieved remarkable results where the protection of human rights is concerned.@@@We have completely abolished forced labour and child labour.@@@For 100 years, millions were forced to pick cotton in Uzbekistan.@@@The vast majority of the population — from teachers and doctors to entrepreneurs, workers and employees and, unfortunately, schoolchildren and university students — were mobilized to pick cotton every year from September to December.@@@As a result.@@@Uzbek cotton was boycotted and for years the country was blacklisted.@@@Thanks to our will and determination, all of that is now history.@@@Our people have been completely liberated from cotton slavery.@@@The ban on forced labour is guaranteed in our renewed Constitution and we have introduced criminal liability for involvement in the practice.@@@I believe it is essential to intensify the global fight against forced and child labour, and our experience shows that it is possible to put an end to such practices.@@@One of Uzbekistan’s strategic tasks is developing our human capital and training a creative young generation.@@@We believe that high-quality education, accessible for all, is the most effective factor in eradicating poverty, improving public welfare and achieving sustainable economic growth.@@@In that respect, our country has gained considerable ground in recent years, with the education system undergoing radical transformation.@@@In the past six years, preschool education coverage has increased from 21 to 70 per cent, and that of higher education from 9 to 38 per cent.@@@By 2030 we will have created the conditions for every child to have access to preschool education and for half of all secondary school graduates to obtain higher education.@@@In recent years the countries of Central Asia have embarked on a path of good-neighbourliness, stability, joint partnership and progress.@@@Thanks to our joint efforts.@@@Uzbekistan has managed to address problems related to State borders, transport corridors and water use with all of its neighbours.@@@Mutual trade between the countries of the region has grown more than two- and-a-half times and the number of joint ventures has increased fivefold.@@@Our region has become a promising centre for economic development and a transport and communications bridge linking East and West.@@@North and South.@@@That has led to growing interest in our countries’ potential.@@@Central Asia’s openness to the world is becoming an important basis for ensuring the region’s security and stable development.@@@It is safe to say that our people have united around a growing sense of regional identity that is becoming ever stronger.@@@We share not only a common history but a future and vital interests.@@@Expanding our regional cooperation is and will be our only choice.@@@I believe firmly that with the support of the international community.@@@Central Asia will continue on a path of unity.@@@In that regard, transforming Central Asia into a peaceful and prosperous region will remain a priority goal of Uzbekistan’s foreign policy from now on.@@@In Central Asia, where almost half of the population belongs to the younger generation, dealing with the issues facing young people and creating opportunities so that they can realize their potential are vital.@@@In order to strengthen cooperation in that area, the countries of our region recently signed an agreement on the common dimensions of our youth policy.@@@We are interested in establishing effective cooperation with the United Nations and its specialized structures while studying the best practices and achievements of other regions.@@@In that regard.@@@I propose to establish a working group at the United Nations to support youth development in Central Asia.@@@As part of that endeavour, it would be helpful to develop a youth agenda for Central Asia for 2030.@@@Women’s active participation in society and public administration is an urgent issue today.@@@One of the noblest goals of our national policy is ensuring family stability, legal protection and a peaceful life for women and girls.@@@In addition, we are making systemic efforts to achieve equality between men and women.@@@For example, last year, girls accounted for 49 per cent of university enrolments, and women’s participation in public administration reached 35 per cent for the first time.@@@We have enacted a special law aimed at protecting women and minors from domestic violence, and we are interested in further expanding our cooperation with UN-Women.@@@As a joint initiative, we have proposed holding the Asia Women’s Forum in Uzbekistan next year to discuss the fulfilment of women’s creative potential and to exchange experiences and best practices in that area.@@@The world is facing a critical environmental situation today.@@@The triple planetary crises of climate change, biodiversity loss and environmental contamination are worsening.@@@In those challenging conditions, while the countries of Central Asia have continued to grapple with the tragedy of the Aral Sea, our region is becoming one of the parts of the world most vulnerable to climate change.@@@Uzbekistan is doing its best to mitigate the consequences of the Aral Sea tragedy, which remains a global problem.@@@In the past few years we have created 1.7 million hectares of green areas with drought- tolerant plants on the dried-up bed of the Aral Sea, but the support of the international community is essential if we are to continue those vital efforts.@@@Over the past 30 years, the air temperature in our region has increased by 1.5°C — more than twice the global average.@@@As a result, nearly one third of the total area of glaciers in the region has melted.@@@If that trend continues, the flow of the Amu Darya and the Syr Darya, the two major rivers in our region, could decrease by 15 per cent in the next 20 years.@@@It is expected that the per capita water supply will fall by 25 per cent and agricultural yields by 40 per cent.@@@Unless we take timely and effective measures, the consequences of those problems will seriously undermine our region’s socioeconomic stability.@@@In that context, we support the establishment of the position of a special representative of the Secretary-General for water resources.@@@We are in favour of attracting and introducing state-of-art technologies for the process of establishing a water- saving-technologies platform in Central Asia, using the United Nations Inter-Agency Mechanism on All Freshwater Related Issues.@@@Including Sanitation.@@@We are building systematic cooperation as part of the green development programme that the countries of the region have adopted.@@@That partnership completely dovetails with our interests and is aimed at preventing threats related to climate change.@@@In that regard.@@@I believe that the implementation of the outcomes of the High-Level Dialogue on Climate Change and Resilience in Central Asia will be extremely useful.@@@We have put forward an initiative on adopting a draft resolution entitled “Central Asia facing global climate threats: solidarity for common prosperity”, and we propose to discuss its substance at an international climate forum to be held in Samarkand next year.@@@In that regard.@@@I would like to emphasize that adapting the main sectors of Uzbekistan’s economy to climate change, achieving carbon neutrality and drastically increasing green energy’s share in our energy mix remains a strategic task for us.@@@We need to strengthen our joint efforts to prevent the spread of the scourge of extremism and the radicalization of young people.@@@In Tashkent in March, we adopted a joint plan of action for the implementation of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy in Central Asia.@@@As part of our national strategy on countering extremism and terrorism, we are particularly emphasizing the issue, including by helping people affected by extremist ideas to return to normal lives and reintegrate into society.@@@We have gained unique experience in that regard.@@@As part of our Mehr humanitarian operation — which means “benevolence” and has been carried out five times over — we have repatriated more than 530 of our citizens, most of them women and children, from conflict zones in the Middle East and Afghanistan.@@@They have all received medical, psychological and social assistance and other forms of support.@@@Here at United Nations Headquarters in June, the international community heard stories from people who had been repatriated to our country and who had embarked on a new life.@@@In order to continue the ongoing efforts in that direction and to promote a continued exchange of lessons learned, we have taken specific measures under the auspices of the Office of Counter-Terrorism to establish a council of regional experts on systemic work with people repatriated from combat zones.@@@We Member States must be more united and work together to combat common threats such as international terrorism.@@@I would like to emphasize another important matter.@@@We believe that the recent manifestations of religious intolerance and Islamophobia that we have seen in some countries are unacceptable.@@@Under the auspices of UNESCO, and in order to promote ideas of religious tolerance and cooperation globally, we propose establishing an international centre in Uzbekistan for interreligious dialogue and cooperation.@@@We take great pride in the fact that our country is the homeland of outstanding scholars and thinkers such as Al-Khwarizmi.@@@Al-Biruni.@@@I bn Sina.@@@Imam Al-Bukhari.@@@Mirzo Ulugbek and Alisher Navoiy, who made incomparable contributions to the development of science and showed Islam to be a religion of knowledge and peace.@@@Next year, in order to study the rich heritage of those great scholars and reveal to the world the true humane essence of Islam, we propose organizing in Uzbekistan an international conference entitled “Islam: a religion of peace and kindness”.@@@The developments in Afghanistan have had a direct impact on international security.@@@The country is facing an unprecedented situation that demands a unique approach to resolving its issues.@@@Leaving Afghanistan to once again face its problems alone would be a grave mistake.@@@Ignoring it, isolating it and imposing sanctions on it only exacerbate the hardships facing ordinary Afghans.@@@We believe that humanitarian aid to the Afghan people should not be reduced.@@@We call for developing appropriate mechanisms that can utilize Afghanistan’s frozen international assets to address its acute social problems.@@@We need an open, peaceful and sustainable Afghanistan that is actively engaged in regional cooperation initiatives and ready for mutually beneficial partnerships with its neighbours and other countries.@@@From this rostrum.@@@I urge the international community to come together in resolving the issue of Afghanistan.@@@I believe it is essential that we work together to develop a flexible and constructive approach to the Afghan issue under the leadership of the United Nations.@@@At this turning point in history, we must all consider what kind of planet we will leave to future generations.@@@Only through shared aspirations and collective action can we achieve lasting peace and prosperity.@@@More than ever, we need mutual trust, unity and a spirit of cooperation.@@@In conclusion.@@@I want to reiterate that on this path Uzbekistan will always remain committed to strengthening deep and long-term cooperation with United Nations structures and all countries.@@@On 26 July 1946, in San Francisco, our predecessors pledged to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind; to unite our strength to maintain international peace and security; and to settle Members’ international disputes by peaceful means and refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State.@@@Those pledges were the promise of our predecessors, bestowed upon us for the future.@@@The Charter of the United Nations is a promise, not a reality.@@@If we are complacent in our actions, the words are not worth the paper on which they are written.@@@The horrors of the Second World War, which began in Europe and consumed the world, brought nations together.@@@We assembled here today must live up to the obligations prescribed in the United Nations Charter to proclaim “never again”.@@@Make no mistake — we bear the responsibility to ensure that the world does not drift into the horror of war.@@@That is our mandate.@@@Do we have the courage to fulfil it?@@@Do we have the resolve to make peace our top priority and to honour the foundations of the United Nations and ensure its continued relevance?@@@Our predecessors harboured an admirable sense of their own personal accountability for the future.@@@I believe it is that sense of personal responsibility, at the individual level, that underpins the idea and reality of the United Nations throughout the world.@@@Our predecessors also knew that the path to peace would be challenging.@@@They had the resolve, the deep belief and the knowledge that it would require the ability of all peoples to come together to make peace a reality so that their children and the generations to come — our children today — would not be scarred by another world war.@@@But they also had the greatest of all impetuses.@@@The world and the leaders that came before us inherited ashes, not institutions.@@@They had no choice but to look to multilateralism, international law and respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States.@@@Today, as we stand on the shoulders of our predecessors, we remain accountable to deliver on the vision of peace that sparked the creation of this resilient Organization.@@@Will we be worthy and equal to the challenge?@@@Can we act with a sense of urgency, without which we too will fail?@@@As a historian by training.@@@I believe adamantly that history serves as an invaluable compass and the most valuable source of lessons.@@@More than seven decades after the establishment of the United Nations, the war in Ukraine has shaken the world.@@@It reminds us that “never again” is both a rallying cry and a sacred, fragile promise that we need to protect with all our resolve.@@@Cyprus condemns in the strongest terms any breach of international peace and security effected through military action by any State against the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of another State.@@@We stand — in that instance of the violation of international law and in every such instance — on the right side of history.@@@Since the very first day of the aggression against Ukraine, the people of Cyprus — one third of them still displaced as a result of foreign aggression against their own country — have displayed solidarity, in deeds and not just in words, with the people of Ukraine.@@@We do that because we remember.@@@We do that because it is the right thing to do.@@@We call for the immediate cessation of hostilities and encourage the parties to engage in constructive dialogue and negotiation.@@@The world must support that effort, not only because history demands it but also to ensure that the world steps back from the edge of a war that could reduce this institution to rubble.@@@The invasion of Ukraine is not the first instance since the Second World War in which the use of force has been used against a sovereign nation in Europe.@@@Just as in Ukraine, in Cyprus the United Nations Charter and international law continue to be violated.@@@In 1974.@@@Turkey invaded Cyprus, and since then.@@@49 years on, it has occupied European territory, and the 
people of Cyprus — Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots — continue to suffer the consequences of invasion, occupation and division.@@@They are deprived of their fundamental freedoms and human rights.@@@Europe, which decades ago witnessed the worst horrors humankind has ever committed against itself, remains fractured as long as Cyprus is divided.@@@Having been born in 1973, only a few months before Turkey invaded Cyprus.@@@I have witnessed my people mourn, persevere and rebuild, forever with a burning desire for peace and reunification.@@@The invasion violently displaced hundreds of thousands of Cypriots, and Turkey continues to occupy approximately 37 per cent of the territory of the Republic of Cyprus.@@@The families of missing persons desperately await information on the fate of their loved ones.@@@The enclaved stoically await the end of the division.@@@One of the lessons we are reminded of by the recent invasion of Ukraine is that, in the absence of a lasting, viable peace, the resulting fragility can lead to destabilization, with far-reaching consequences not just for the country concerned but for the region to which it belongs and the world at large.@@@Ukraine has exemplified, in the darkest manner, that a threat to peace somewhere is a threat to peace everywhere.@@@In the absence of a peace path and process in Cyprus, there is a serious risk — one that we have seen materialize in the recent past — of further violations of international law, which creates instability, with ramifications well beyond Cyprus.@@@We have witnessed the Turkish military forces perpetrate further violations in Varosha, the fenced area of Famagusta.@@@Since 1974.@@@Varosha has been held hostage and rendered a ghost town, contrary to the Security Council resolutions that call for its return to its lawful inhabitants, who left their livelihoods, dreams and hopes between those fences.@@@We have witnessed — in our maritime zones and most recently in the buffer zone — attacks on United Nations peacekeepers by Turkish forces that have horrified and alerted us once again to the urgency of peace in Cyprus.@@@That is why the resumption of negotiations, firmly anchored on the agreed framework, is my absolute priority.@@@The current status quo cannot be the future of Cyprus.@@@It cannot be the future for Cypriots.@@@As President of the Republic of Cyprus.@@@I believe in peaceful coexistence because, despite growing up in a divided country.@@@I also grew up in a country filled with the hope of reunification and heard stories of all Cypriots living together in peace, united by the land they shared.@@@The new generation of Cypriots is also eager for peace, and that gives me hope and courage.@@@Ahead of my journey to New York.@@@I received a plethora of messages from my Turkish Cypriot compatriots, particularly from the younger generation, calling on me to exert every effort to reunify Cyprus.@@@My message from this rostrum to my Turkish Cypriot compatriots and to all Cypriots is that I hear their call for peace.@@@I understand their concerns and assure them that I will spare no effort to make our common dream of reunification and peace on our island a reality.@@@I want to be able to tell them that the world, the United Nations, the living words of the Charter of the United Nations, also hear their call for peace.@@@I stand at the General Assembly for the first time, fully aware of the responsibility that has been bestowed upon me to do my utmost to safeguard the future of the Cypriot people — Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots alike — who want to end the division of their country, to co-exist and co-create.@@@Working towards peace in Cyprus is my absolute priority, and I want to take this opportunity to also send a personal message to President Erdogan.@@@There is not, and never will be, another basis for the settlement of the Cyprus question other than that dictated by Security Council resolutions.@@@Illegality stemming from invasion, aggression and the use of force cannot be recognized.@@@Cyprus and Turkey are neighbours, bound by geography.@@@Peace in Cyprus will send a resounding message of peace in a region and a world that desperately need it.@@@It will also change the geopolitical map of our neighbourhood, with a ripple effect in Europe, the wider Eastern Mediterranean and throughout European Union-Turkey relations.@@@Gunboat diplomacy and strong- arm tactics belong to the past.@@@They are not the tools of visionary leaders.@@@This is our time to bring the United Nations Charter to life — a Charter for peace between and among us.@@@No one stands to gain from conflict and division.@@@We and the generations that will come after us stand to gain from dialogue and from good- neighbourly relations.@@@I say then to Mr. Erdogan: let us work together guided by a vision of peace.@@@Let us build a brighter future for our countries through dialogue and respect for international legality.@@@In this great Hall, we all feel the weight of history on our shoulders.@@@The great women and men who gave us this Organization and its institutions expect 
us to strengthen and grow them and take personal responsibility for their future.@@@I am here today with clarity of purpose and determination.@@@The sole effective medium for addressing the risk of instability generated by the absence of a peace path is to pave a path and foster dialogue through which the positions and concerns of all sides can be addressed and discussed in good faith.@@@I stand ready to negotiate boldly and courageously on the Cyprus question in good faith, always within the agreed United Nations framework that calls for a bizonal, bicommunal federation with political equality, as defined by the relevant Security Council resolutions.@@@At a time when international legality is under attack, international law and Security Council resolutions must prevail.@@@I am committed to negotiating a settlement that will safeguard fundamental freedoms and human rights and the interests of all my Cypriot compatriots — Greek Cypriots.@@@Turkish Cypriots.@@@Maronites.@@@Armenians and Latins — all equal; a comprehensive settlement that will allow them to prosper in coexistence and peace, free of any anachronistic dependencies and system of guarantees that have no place in a European country.@@@That is why the resumption of peace negotiations based on the agreed framework, while preserving the acquis of the previous round of negotiations, is essential.@@@As the Security Council has resolved, it is high time for the United Nations to become a driving force of dialogue by, as a first step, appointing an envoy on the Cyprus problem to explore and prepare the ground for the resumption of negotiations.@@@The United Nations and its Secretary-General have the responsibility, prescribed in the United Nations Charter, to act as a catalyst for peace in Cyprus.@@@In doing so, the United Nations can be facilitated by the European Union, which also has the tools necessary and has expressed its commitment to delivering so as to reunify its last divided member State.@@@Just like the United Nations, the European Union is also a project of peace.@@@The European Union can — and must — act decisively, with all the means at its disposal, to drive the reunification of its last divided member State and, in doing so, contribute to peace in Europe, the wider Middle East and indeed the world.@@@The theme of this year’s session of the General Assembly focuses on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with a view to achieving peace, prosperity, progress and sustainability for all.@@@The achievement of the SDGs requires universal efforts and transformative solutions.@@@The climate emergency and climate change know no borders.@@@Our own region, the Eastern Mediterranean, is especially vulnerable in that regard.@@@The raging wildfires and floods during the summer were a sombre reminder of the fact that we are failing to act, at our own peril.@@@We have regrettably all observed nature’s wrath, from the storms in countries of our region to those in countries such as Libya, in which thousands so tragically lost their lives.@@@To that end.@@@Cyprus is actively participating in a new international climate change initiative to address the specific needs and challenges that countries in our neighbourhood are facing to advance mitigation actions.@@@The Climate Ambition Summit, which is being held today, is a critical milestone in confirming our collective political will to achieve the transition to a climate-resilient global economy.@@@At the same time, recognizing that human rights are essential for lasting peace and sustainable development, we must ensure that they guide the solutions to our challenges.@@@The international human rights agenda is a priority policy for Cyprus, and it is exactly for that reason that we announced our candidacy for the Human Rights Council for the period 2025-2027.@@@As a European Union member State, we are committed to taking action against gender-based violence, and we have also joined the Secretary-General’s circle of leadership on the prevention of, and response to, sexual exploitation and abuse at the United Nations.@@@In 1946.@@@Winston Churchill declared that the dangers and difficulties of establishing the conditions of freedom and democracy and permanently preventing war will not be removed by closing our eyes to them or by a policy of appeasement towards aggressors.@@@What is needed is real action.@@@And the longer that is delayed, the more difficult it will be and the greater the dangers will become.@@@Cyprus is at the crossroads of Europe and the Middle East, in a part of the world that is no stranger to conflict and instability.@@@However, we are convinced that the Eastern Mediterranean and the wider Middle East are changing the narrative of being a region in turmoil.@@@We can become a hub of stability, peace and cooperation — an exemplar of the change capable in the twenty-first century.@@@Cyprus seeks to act as a facilitator for that common vision and has come together with its immediate neighbours — Egypt.@@@Israel.@@@Jordan.@@@Lebanon.@@@Palestine and Greece — to build a solid 
network of cooperation that is underpinned by a vision to make the Mediterranean Sea a sea of peace, cooperation and prosperity.@@@We shall continue on that path of multilateralism, anchored on respect for international legality, and we call on all countries of the region that share those values to join us.@@@That, after all, is the essence of the guiding principles that founded the United Nations 78 years ago.@@@I come before the Assembly today to ask for us all to work together towards peace.@@@It is nothing new or ground-breaking, but it is world-changing.@@@And we need to remind ourselves every day that it is within our reach and responsibility.@@@I congratulate Mr. Dennis Francis of Trinidad and Tobago on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session.@@@I extend my sincere condolences to the victims and families of the natural disasters that hit Morocco and Libya in recent days.@@@We stand in solidarity with our Moroccan and Libyan friends during this difficult time.@@@“Rebuilding trust and reigniting solidarity” is an appropriate point of departure not only for reflecting on the challenges before the multilateral system today, but also for reviewing developments in my own country.@@@Sri Lanka, over the past year.@@@At this time last year, amidst multiple global crises.@@@Sri Lanka was experiencing its most challenging period in recent times, socially, economically and politically, which had a devastating impact on people’s lives.@@@Even our democratic traditions were threatened by attempts to occupy our Parliament and bring it to a halt.@@@Nevertheless, we succeeded in bringing about a democratic political transition, due to our deeply entrenched and resilient democratic traditions.@@@The restoration of Sri Lanka’s economy, coupled with a gift of fertilizer from the United States Government that led to a bumper harvest, assisted us in ensuring stability during that period.@@@The reforms I have since initiated in the economic, financial, institutional and reconciliation fronts have been directed, on the one hand, towards rebuilding trust and confidence between the people and the Government and, on the other, towards laying the foundation for economic stabilization and recovery.@@@Sri Lankans are already witnessing the positive outcomes of those measures in their daily lives and the revival of confidence internally and externally in the progress of the country.@@@It is my intention to lead the country towards sustainable and stable recovery and growth, which will benefit all segments of Sri Lankan society in all parts of the country, ensuring a future of peace, prosperity and reconciliation for present and future generations of women and men.@@@In reaching that goal, we will be accompanied by the support, trust and solidarity of our own people and of the international community.@@@As we turn the corner towards the eightieth anniversary of the United Nations and prepare for the Summit of the Future in 2024, we see the fragmented geopolitical landscape of a multipolar world where new centres of global power have emerged.@@@Accompanying that systemic change are, on the one hand, great expectations of development and human progress, with millions of people rising out of poverty to prosperity.@@@On the other hand, we see a world where former big- Power rivalries and geopolitical tensions have reignited in open war, overlapping with new theatres of conflict and tension on land and in the oceans.@@@Security alliances have expanded, and recent arrangements have been formed to deal with strategic threat perceptions in old and new theatres of conflict.@@@North-South divisions are widening with the digital divide, the financial and debt crisis and the energy transition.@@@Contrary to the promise of 2030, today we are seeing levels of poverty and hunger not witnessed in decades.@@@Neutral, non-aligned countries of the global South such as Sri Lanka are once again constrained between new global power configurations, facing those who do not respect the sovereignty of our nations.@@@In numerous recent declarations at the United Nations and beyond — including at the Group of 20 (G20) in Delhi, at the Pretoria meeting of the BRICS countries Brazil.@@@Russia.@@@India.@@@China and South Africa, and at the Group of Seven in Hiroshima — we have agreed that our challenges are interconnected across borders and all other divides.@@@We must grasp the opportunity to unite in order to build an inclusive future for future generations.@@@It is an appropriate reflection of the current global predicament that the theme of this year’s general debate is “Rebuilding trust and reigniting global solidarity:@@@Accelerating action on the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals towards peace, prosperity, progress, and sustainability for all” .@@@This year, in parallel with the General Assembly, we have participated in three interrelated summits dealing with accelerating the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), financing for development and climate ambition, at which we agreed that international solidarity and collective action are needed to address those simultaneously.@@@The cross-border financial impacts of crises, such as climate change and the pandemic, are impeding the ability of smaller indebted countries, such as mine, to make progress on the SDGs and climate adaptation and mitigation.@@@Conflicts and tensions among big Powers are complicating the policy environment for the rest by adding uncertainty to economic and macro-financial stability, disrupting supply chains and causing inflation, as well as food and energy insecurity.@@@Long before the SDGs.@@@Sri Lanka had achieved high human and social development indicators that ranked us in a category well above other middle-income countries.@@@Sri Lanka has not shirked its responsibility to the planet.@@@Last year, at the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, we outlined our climate ambition plan.@@@We said that by 2030, we would have 70 per cent renewable energy in electricity generation, increase forest cover by 32 per cent and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 14.5 per cent.@@@We will phase out coal by 2040 and reach net zero by 2050.@@@Our low- carbon development trajectory has given us one of the lowest per capita carbon emission rates of any lower middle-income country.@@@This year, as a result of exogenous shocks and debt, the incremental progress we were proud to have achieved has been reversed.@@@Food inflation costs put significant pressure on food security amongst vulnerable communities.@@@At the same time, children’s education and nutrition have suffered due to the pandemic and the economic crisis.@@@In parallel, last month in Sri Lanka we were grappling with the driest weather spell seen in recent years, followed by torrential rainfalls.@@@Adverse climate outcomes are spilling over into our tight fiscal space just as we begin to stabilize from last year’s economic crisis.@@@As Sri Lanka is a climate-vulnerable developing country in debt crisis, the urgent need to mobilize climate finance is greater today than it ever was before.@@@However, despite promises made to which we were all witness, the rich countries are not delivering to expectation.@@@Developed countries must do their part and fulfil what they have agreed to, assume their share of the common but differentiated responsibility, and provide assistance for mitigation, adaptation and compensation for loss and damage.@@@National efforts alone will not suffice to ensure the success of the SDGs and reverse climate change.@@@The need for global solidarity to restructure the international financial architecture is paramount.@@@That is articulated loud and clear in multiple global forums, including at the G20 and the BRICS.@@@The Secretary-General’s SDG stimulus highlights the interconnections between the achievement of the SDGs, combatting climate change and the concrete interventions required by creditors sovereign and private, as well as by the international financial institutions, including to mitigate the debt crisis.@@@It is an accepted estimate that the 2008 financial crisis cost the United States economy $4 trillion.@@@Recent studies in the United States have stated that the impact of the pandemic on the United States economy from 2020 to 2024 would reach $14 trillion.@@@Those numbers would more than double if the rest of the global economy were added.@@@We have not faced an economic crisis of this magnitude any time before in our modern history.@@@The cost of the Second World War in today’s United States dollars would amount to only $4 trillion and the Marshall Plan would cost $150 billion.@@@That illustrates the magnitude of the challenge before us.@@@If we are unable to restructure the global fiscal order, then certainly we will fail in the struggle to reverse climate change and achieve the SDG goals.@@@There is still time for course correction, as the crisis has not reached its peak.@@@At the same time, the Paris Summit for a New Global Financing Pact will come up with the funding requirements.@@@Therefore, the Summit of the Future should not craft new programmes, but restructure the present financial architecture to suit the needs created by climate change and sustainable development.@@@That must be the priority of the General Assembly.@@@We cannot afford to allow divisions to drive focus away from the crisis.@@@While key issues such as the Bridgetown Initiative and the necessity to address the debt of low-income countries are being discussed in the Assembly, it is not commanding the attention it deserves.@@@Unfortunately, the Security Council has failed to give priority to the connected issues of climate change, debt relief and sustainable development.@@@That impacts the future of humankind.@@@The survival of the planet must be our priority; we cannot afford to go into this war with a divided high command.@@@The future of all species on the globe is dependent on our ability to set aside our rivalries until the crisis is resolved.@@@The multilateral machinery, which reflects the world of the past century, needs to be reformed to meet the challenges of the present and the future.@@@That machinery has failed to find a solution to the longstanding Palestine question.@@@The composition of the Security Council must be expanded to be representative of current global diversity and decision-making.@@@In parallel, the role of the General Assembly must be strengthened.@@@We are asking that the permanent members engage in a credible dialogue that would lead to a unified approach to combat those threats ahead of the coming sessions.@@@I repeat — we are asking that the permanent members engage in a credible dialogue that would lead to a unified approach to combat those threats ahead of the coming sessions.@@@While we seek solidarity and financing to alleviate poverty and climate challenges, global military expenditures have risen today to record levels reaching $2.24 trillion.@@@That reflects the strategic trust deficit among the powerful.@@@Key arms control frameworks that were instrumental in maintaining system stability in the past have collapsed, and nuclear conflict is once again under open discussion, potentially and apocalyptically triggered by autonomous control.@@@We urge restraint in the increase of military expenditure, which leads to escalation of conflict.@@@Developing countries have been the voice of sanity and reason in that regard for decades.@@@In keeping with Sri Lanka’s long-standing position in support of the disarmament of weapons of mass destruction and nuclear weapons, this year Sri Lanka ratified the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.@@@Yesterday we acceded to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.@@@The war in Ukraine has far-reaching and severe financial and humanitarian repercussions on food, hunger and debt in all parts of the world, including Sri Lanka.@@@It is recalled that the Charter of the United Nations vests powerful States in the Security Council with the responsibility to maintain international peace and security and to de-escalate rather than ignite conflict.@@@We need to halt the momentum whereby this and other big-Power tensions are spilling over into established areas of international rules-based cooperation forged over decades of multilateral negotiation, ranging from international trade to ocean governance.@@@The international system is today undergoing vast changes.@@@At the same time, it is being confronted with unprecedented challenges.@@@We come to the United Nations to demonstrate solidarity in arriving at common solutions.@@@What is at stake is not the future of the United Nations, but the future of our planet as a whole.@@@Member States will need to find new ways of working together despite the increasing mistrust that has permeated international relations.@@@We who have not been able to find a solution to the Palestinian question must now be able at least to find a solution to the questions that threaten the existence of the global community.@@@That can be achieved through the willingness of the permanent members to work together in solidarity with the developing world.@@@They must show the way.@@@I would like to congratulate you.@@@Sir, on your election to the honourable function of the President of the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session, and to express Poland’s full support for your mission and wishes for your every success in its fulfilment.@@@At the same time, my thanks go to His Excellency Mr. Csaba Korosi, in recognition of his active engagement while presiding over the work of the Assembly at its seventy-seventh session.@@@The representatives of 193 countries from every continent have gathered in New York at United Nations Headquarters to discuss the most important threats and challenges facing the world today.@@@The Assembly’s general debate is an extremely important event.@@@It is the only place and our only opportunity to discuss in 
person the crucial problems that affect us all.@@@We are here because of the courageous and forward-looking decisions made by the leaders of the Western world during the darkest days of the Second World War.@@@At the time, they pondered how to avoid similar tragedies in the future.@@@The leaders of the United States and Great Britain.@@@President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill, and soon the other countries of the anti-Hitler coalition, including Poland, signed the Atlantic Charter.@@@It contained the most important principles on which the post-war world order was to be based — the self- determination of nations, the inviolability of borders, the renunciation of violence, economic cooperation and human rights.@@@The Atlantic Charter, together with the Washington Declaration, was the cornerstone in the building of the United Nations Organization.@@@Today it has once again befallen us to live in dangerous times.@@@As a result of Russia’s full-scale aggression against Ukraine, hundreds of thousands of people have lost their lives or been injured.@@@Millions have been forced to flee their home country and hundreds of millions worldwide are facing the spectre of famine and serious economic disruptions.@@@Russia’s brutal aggression has brought immense global problems in its aftermath.@@@It has put the international world order to the test.@@@The cost of those barbarian actions — humanitarian, material and environmental — are incalculable and still growing.@@@For a long time, world peace has never been as threatened as it is today.@@@We Poles know full well that peace is not to be taken for granted.@@@September, in the history of my home country, is a special month.@@@On 1 September 1939.@@@Nazi Germany invaded my homeland.@@@Poland.@@@The Second World War broke out.@@@On 17 September 1939, we received a blow from another direction: the Soviet Union also made an onslaught on Poland.@@@In the wake of the alliance between Hitler and Stalin — Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia — Poland lost its independence, was wiped off the world map and subjected to an extremely brutal occupation.@@@That is precisely why we understand the tragedy of Ukraine, as well as the tragedy of other countries experiencing the pandemonium of war, better than any other country in the world.@@@During the Second World War.@@@6 million of our citizens perished, including 3 million Polish Jews.@@@Warsaw, the capital of Poland, was razed to the ground.@@@And yet our history stands as a testament to the fact that even crimes and persecution are not able to suppress the true spirit of freedom, and freedom will finally prevail.@@@Enslavement, imperialism and neocolonialism are as much a denial of freedom as insane dreams of dominating others.@@@When unleashing the war in Ukraine.@@@Vladimir Putin wanted to restore the Russian empire, to divide the world and to make Europe systematically dependent on his raw materials.@@@He has not succeeded.@@@It is my firm belief that he will no longer succeed.@@@Today the world needs courageous and visionary leaders.@@@The late President of Poland.@@@Lech Kaczynski, with whom I had the honour to cooperate, was such a leader.@@@He was a leader who, a dozen years ago, was trying to shake consciences, appeal to politicians and warn of the imperialist policy of Vladimir Putin’s Russia.@@@Let me recall, at this point.@@@Lech Kaczynski’s seminal words spoken in Tbilisi at the height of the Russian aggression on Georgia in 2008:@@@“For the first time in a long time.@@@Russians have shown the face we have known for hundreds of years.@@@They believe that the nations around them should be subjected to them.@@@We say no.@@@Russia believes that the old days of the empire that collapsed less than 20 years ago are coming back and that domination will again be a feature of our region.@@@Well, it will not.@@@Those days are over, once and for all.”@@@Yes: today, in this very place, at United Nations Headquarters.@@@I wish to reiterate that those days can never return.@@@The logic of conquest, changing borders by force, disregarding the law and denying the Ukrainian people their right to exist must be stopped.@@@The brutal war must end; it must not be converted into a frozen war.@@@That can be done only by restoring the full territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders.@@@Poland’s position in the face of any war is clear and straightforward.@@@We demand absolute respect for internationally recognized national borders.@@@The inviolability of those borders is a fundamental element of the world order.@@@Today the victim is Ukraine; tomorrow it could be any one of us if we do not follow those iron-clad rules and if we do not insistently enforce compliance with international law.@@@Forgotten and unpunished war crimes and crimes against humanity build a sense of impunity among the perpetrators.@@@Such crimes give permission to those perpetrators’ successors and imitators, who, following suit, commit similar crimes when they want to dominate and determine the 
fate of other States and nations.@@@The crimes committed during the war in Ukraine are living proof thereof.@@@That is why we are engaged in an initiative to hold Russia accountable for gross violations of the fundamental norms of international law.@@@We strongly support the work of the International Criminal Court and the International Court of Justice.@@@We support the work of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry under the Human Rights Council to investigate violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in the context of the Russian aggression and to collect, verify and preserve evidence.@@@We support the idea of establishing an ad hoc special tribunal.@@@Crimes must be accounted for and their perpetrators punished.@@@Information warfare goes on.@@@Lies are used to cover up and justify Russian crimes against the civilian population.@@@Russia continually tries to shape international public opinion by building a false vision of reality.@@@In Poland that comes as no surprise to us, but the world is just about to discover the scale of the manipulation and disinformation.@@@The spearhead is often directed also at my country.@@@Poland, which has been libelled in many various ways.@@@That is because we have consistently opposed Russia’s imperialist and neocolonialist policy and have supported Ukraine in its defence from the outset.@@@We, as the international community, must draw conclusions from the situation.@@@We must confront manipulation and disinformation.@@@We must fight against the hypocrisy of history and the reversal of the roles of henchman and victim.@@@What is evil should be called evil.@@@A crime should be called a crime.@@@These days, many States are being blamed for prolonging the war as they supply necessary weapons to Ukraine in its war of defence.@@@That is a completely false logic, akin to putting the blame on a neighbour who comes to the aid of the people next door defending their home against a burglar.@@@If one’s household is attacked, one has the right to defend it — and one’s neighbours should not stay indifferent.@@@Ukraine would not be able to resist the aggression and effectively stand up for its independence if it were not for the assistance of other countries and, primarily, on the biggest scale, the United States of America.@@@It is the United States that has been playing a pivotal role in assuring security in Europe for more than a century.@@@I say that as the President of a European country that has been plagued by the experience of war on many occasions.@@@It must be remembered that the engagement of the United States in the First World War led to its end, as well as to the restoration of independence in Poland and other countries in Central and Eastern Europe.@@@The United States played a pivotal role in defeating Nazi Germany.@@@Without the United States support, neither the United Kingdom nor the Soviet Union would have been able to resist Hitler.@@@Finally, the United States was instrumental in the reconstruction of Western Europe in the aftermath of war and in fending off the threat posed by the Soviet Union throughout the Cold War.@@@Too often.@@@Europe tends to forget that it owes its security and prosperity to the United States’ commitment and presence.@@@In Poland, we recall that very well, that is why Poland’s top priority for its presidency of the European Union, in the first half of 2025, will be enhancing transatlantic relations and cooperation between the European Union and the United States of America.@@@Poland has never had colonies, a fact of which we are proud.@@@We emphasize it on every occasion.@@@Instead, my home country many times was brutally attacked, destroyed and used by neighbours to advance their imperial ambitions.@@@For 123 years.@@@Poland disappeared from the maps of the world.@@@That is why we understand very well the countries that suffered colonialism and the challenges they need to confront.@@@Wherever the international community is in need.@@@Poland is always ready to respond to its call and does so without any hesitation.@@@We provide assistance in many corners of the world.@@@Despite the war in our immediate neighbourhood, we will continue our support to the Eastern Partnership countries.@@@We continue to focus on the countries of the sub-Saharan region.@@@We are present in the Middle East.@@@Given the refugee crisis caused by the war in Syria.@@@Poland’s assistance to Iraq.@@@Lebanon.@@@Palestine and Jordan will be maintained.@@@Poland will also continue its humanitarian support.@@@Many places around the world are facing worsening food crises.@@@The situation is most difficult in Africa, where one in five people is suffering from hunger.@@@Also, the population suffering from hunger is increasing in West Asia and the Caribbean.@@@Today an estimated 2.4 billion people lack sustainable regular access to food, of which some 900 million face severe food insecurity.@@@Therefore, in 2022, we in Poland have 
supported the World Food Programme’s activities in Africa, the Middle East and Asia, including in Lebanon.@@@Afghanistan.@@@Tajikistan and Syria.@@@We fund our activities mainly through multilateral channels, as well as through Polish non-governmental organizations and their local partners.@@@Poland fully recognizes the ambitions of the African Union to play an even more active role on the global stage, ensuring peace and development in Africa will be facilitated by good and cost-effective governance and the development of democracy on the continent.@@@We respect the principle of African solutions to African problems and stand ready to share the experience we have gained in the difficult but successful transformation of our economy.@@@Poland is a country of freedom and solidarity.@@@It is known worldwide for the great Solidarity movement which not only stood for workers’ rights but also for freedom and fundamental values.@@@The movement brought together millions of people, courageously defied evil and changed the course of modern history, bringing about the fall of communism.@@@We are extremely proud of our solidarity.@@@With regard to the Russian aggression against Ukraine, the Poles have once again illustrated that solidarity is not only a great part of their history, but that solidarity lives in us.@@@Millions of my compatriots committed themselves to bringing aid to people fleeing the nightmare of war.@@@In the very first days of the war, many journalists were coming to Poland and invariably asked me.@@@“Where are the refugee camps?”@@@And my response was.@@@“There are not any.@@@There are none.”@@@There was no talk about camps.@@@We hosted our guests in our own homes.@@@We also had the honour of hosting many world leaders who came bringing humanitarian aid, including the Secretary-General and other United Nations high-ranking officials.@@@I thank them for their support and their presence.@@@Greater solidarity must come as a response to evil, war and aggression.@@@Without solidarity there will be no lasting peace.@@@The world today needs more solidarity.@@@We believe that the idea of solidarity-based development, which we hold so dear, is a beacon for security and prosperity.@@@Poland is ready to take on concrete measures to support the United Nations operations undertaken to confront the most fundamental global challenges and threats and social and economic crises.@@@We wish to support the idea of just transition, of economic and social changes that will not lose sight of the human dimension so that nobody is left behind.@@@We believe that our experience as the leader of Central Europe, the fifth-largest economy in the European Union and the largest State in the Three Seas Initiative can prove valuable to many countries with varying degrees of economic and social development.@@@We are ready to share with our partners from around the world not only our experience in the process of economic transformation but also specific technologies that many Polish companies have available.@@@Poland is proud to have been elected a member of the Economic and Social Council for the 2024- 2026 term.@@@A key priority of our Economic and Social Council membership will be to draw the international community’s attention to the impact of global crises, such as armed conflicts, the energy crisis, the coronavirus disease pandemic and climate change, and their impact on socioeconomic development.@@@Time is running out to achieve the goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals, and there are still many challenges ahead, so we must unite and intensify our efforts to accelerate the implementation of the individual tasks.@@@Today the United Nations measures its strength against various challenges.@@@With regard to the decision-making impasse in the Security Council, the situation in which Russia, one of the permanent members of the Council, is deliberately violating the Charter of the United Nations, the lengthy debates are considered a symptom of the weakness of both the Organization and its constituent States.@@@There are some people who ask whether the United Nations is needed at all, whether it fits the times.@@@On behalf of Poland, a neighbour of attacked Ukraine and a country that has taken in millions of refugees.@@@I emphatically answer: yes.@@@The United Nations is very much needed.@@@No better system for international cooperation has been invented.@@@The United Nations best justifies its existence not in New York or Geneva, but by bringing aid and assistance to those most in need: children, victims of war, the persecuted and the hungry, every day, all over the world.@@@In 2025, the United Nations will celebrate 80 years of existence.@@@We remember why it was founded.@@@Today, in these dangerous times, we need a return to the thinking and actions of the founding fathers of the United Nations.@@@There will be no lasting peace without cooperation, without solidarity between richer and poorer countries and, ultimately, without respect for international law.@@@Poland wants cooperation.@@@Poland wants solidarity.@@@Poland wants peace.@@@The world is off track.@@@That is the uncomfortable truth.@@@Eight years ago, we adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@Denmark had just assumed the presidency of the General Assembly.@@@The adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) was a proud moment, not just for Denmark, but for all of us — a historic moment at which we, the United Nations, launched a transformational agenda.@@@Today we urgently need transformational action on a massive scale.@@@We need to get the SDGs back on track.@@@We need to fast-track the green transition and accelerate climate adaptation, and we need to revitalize multilateralism and bring the United Nations and other institutions of global governance firmly into the twenty-first century.@@@Those are immense tasks, but they are neither impossible nor optional.@@@It is the duty of our generation to get the world back on track, to break the vicious circle of distrust and division that is undermining our ability to act collectively and to replace that vicious circle with trust and solidarity, as highlighted in the overarching theme for this year’s General Assembly.@@@Trust is not built on the promises that we give.@@@It is built on the promises that we keep.@@@Halfway to 2030, only 15 per cent of the Sustainable Development Goals are on track to being realized.@@@The rest are only progressing slowly, or even moving in the wrong direction.@@@This year we celebrate the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and today it is as relevant as ever.@@@The SDGs seek to realize the human rights of all.@@@Yet human rights are under pressure around the globe.@@@That is not least true for women and girls — more than half of the world’s population.@@@For the first time in a generation, extreme poverty is increasing.@@@Hunger levels are surpassing those of a decade ago, while climate shocks are hitting those most vulnerable at an accelerating speed.@@@More than 360 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance worldwide.@@@All Governments have a responsibility to prioritize the SDGs at home.@@@But, for some countries, that is easier said than done.@@@According to the Secretary-General, developing countries need a staggering $3.9 trillion between now and 2030 in order to achieve the Goals.@@@To bridge that gap it is necessary for others to help.@@@It is our shared responsibility.@@@For more than 40 years.@@@Denmark has met the United Nations target of providing at least 0.7 per cent of gross national income for development assistance, and we continually encourage other rich countries to also prioritize that target.@@@But, even if we all lived up to the 0.7 per cent United Nations target, it would still cover only 10 per cent of the financing gap.@@@It is simply not enough.@@@We need to find new, innovative ways to finance the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and to realize the goals of the Paris Agreement on 
Climate Change by mobilizing domestic as well as international resources, including private capital.@@@This year.@@@Denmark is increasing its grant-based climate financing to the highest-ever level — $745 million, of which approximately 60 per cent will be allocated for adaptation.@@@Next year, we will double our contribution to the Green Climate Fund to approximately $234 million.@@@We are also increasing our support to the Danish Development Finance Institution, enabling it to triple its annual contribution to climate financing in developing countries, from $300 million today to approximately $900 million towards 2030.@@@This year.@@@Denmark, a country with a population of just below 6 million people, expects to contribute more than 1 per cent of the $100 billion target.@@@We expect our share to be even higher next year.@@@For Denmark, delivering on our promises is a matter of assuming global responsibility, as well as showing international solidarity.@@@To mobilize financing for development and climate action, we also need to better leverage the enormous potential of the international financial institutions.@@@The development banks, including the World Bank, must raise not billions, but trillions of dollars for climate action and the SDGs.@@@Growing burdens of debt are keeping struggling economies at a deadlock.@@@A new creditor landscape is challenging existing mechanisms for debt treatment.@@@That is a challenge that we need to tackle together as a global community and with the constructive engagement of all creditors.@@@Denmark is deeply engaged in those efforts.@@@We will be pushing for the highest ambitions at the upcoming annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in Marrakesh, as well as at the twenty-eighth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP28).@@@The international financial architecture must be revisited.@@@Who decides?@@@Who benefits?@@@Is it fair?@@@Is it working?@@@That is a conversation that we need to have.@@@The international financial architecture must reflect the world of today, rather than the world of yesterday.@@@The climate emergency is worsening.@@@The year 2023 is on track to become the warmest year ever recorded.@@@Unless we do something dramatic, the extremes of today will soon become the new normal.@@@Denmark is urging the world’s biggest emitters to reduce their carbon emissions, phase out fossil fuels and commit to renewable energy.@@@At the same time, we need to significantly scale up our efforts to adapt to climate change and address climate-induced loss and damages.@@@Despite having contributed the least to climate change, it is the poorest and most vulnerable parts of the world that suffer the most devastating consequences.@@@We need to make COP28 the turning point in overcoming that global injustice.@@@As stated in the African leaders’ Nairobi Declaration on Climate Change and Call to Action, no country should ever have to choose between development aspirations and climate action.@@@We agree.@@@The fact is that it no longer makes sense to talk about sustainable development without factoring in climate change.@@@We are wasting valuable time and limited resources if we do not integrate our efforts for sustainable development and climate action.@@@We are off track and, to get back on track, we also need to look at the core institutions of our multilateral sy stem and bring them into our time.@@@The world de serve s a more representative, transparent and accountable Security Council, one that is better equipped to address global challenges.@@@The Security Council needs to better reflect the global realities, as well as the desires, needs and concerns of people all over the world.@@@That includes limiting the use of the veto, also through voluntary restraint and enhanced accountability vis-a-vis the General Assembly.@@@Denmark has been, and will continue to be, actively engaged in that discussion.@@@To improve and strengthen our collective ability to prevent conflict and sustain peace, we need a new approach.@@@The Secretary-General’s New Agenda for Peace is a timely contribution to that debate.@@@Denmark welcomes its call for a renewed focus on conflict prevention and peace-building.@@@As a current member of the Peace-building Commission and a major donor to the Peace-building Fund, we know that it is one of the most valuable and efficient tools in the United Nations tool box.@@@Next year’s Summit of the Future — and the process leading up to it — is a timely opportunity to move the discussions on that and other reform issues forward, based on the Secretary General’s proposal in Our Common Agenda (A/75/982).@@@Trust in multilateral cooperation is based on universal respect for the rules that underpin it and on accountability for violations of those rules.@@@Russia’s blatant disrespect of the most fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations, including the principle of territorial sovereignty, is a tragedy for 
the United Nations.@@@It is a look into a brutal world in which international law has lost respect among nations and might is right.@@@The war is not just an unspeakable tragedy for the people of Ukraine.@@@It has devastating effects for the people around the world suffering under food shortages and other global consequences of that senseless war.@@@Denmark supports all meaningful efforts to stop Russia’s aggression against Ukraine.@@@We stand firmly with Ukraine and its Charter-based right to defend its territory, and we support President Zelenskyy’s peace formula for a just peace.@@@We encourage all countries to do the same.@@@Denmark seeks full accountability for Russia’s unlawful war of aggression against Ukraine.@@@That includes responsibility for crimes under international law, as well as reparations.@@@Ensuring that Russia and its representatives are held to account is the shared responsibility of us all, as members of the United Nations.@@@We take hope in the fact that, following Russia’s attack against Ukraine and against the United Nations Charter, we have seen overwhelming support for the Charter among States Members of the United Nations.@@@We must build on that.@@@We have no choice.@@@The major problems of our time are interlinked, and their solutions are interlinked as well.@@@We can solve the problems of our time only through international cooperation.@@@We must not allow the irresponsible behaviour of one Member State to derail and destroy our collective efforts to find common solutions to shared problems.@@@Yesterday Denmark was proud to sign the landmark High Seas Treaty that we adopted earlier this year.@@@The Treaty provides legally binding instruments for protecting and safeguarding the health of our oceans — a task that is vital to advancing SDG 14.@@@It also holds tremendous symbolic value.@@@It shows that, despite growing tensions and divisions, we can still come together and find common ground.@@@At a time when positive news is hard to come by, that is very encouraging.@@@Keeping that in mind.@@@Denmark will do its part to create tangible results, compromises and solutions at the seventy-eighth session of the General Assembly that stands before us.@@@That is the spirit of cooperation that we want to bring to the United Nations and that we hope to bring to the Security Council in 2025 and 2026.@@@We believe that such a spirit of cooperation will bring the world back on track.@@@At the outset.@@@I am honoured to convey the warm greetings of His Majesty Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah Mu’izzaddin Waddaulah.@@@Sultan and Yang Di-Pertuan of Brunei Darussalam, to this year’s session of the General Assembly.@@@My congratulations go to His Excellency Mr. Dennis Francis and the friendly nation of Trinidad and Tobago on assuming the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session.@@@I wish His Excellency a successful year.@@@I thank His Excellency Mr. Csaba Korosi for his leadership as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session.@@@I also sincerely appreciate@@@His Excellency Secretary- General Antonio Guterres for his continuous hard work and valuable contributions to serving the international community during these challenging times in pursuit of global peace, prosperity and development.@@@As we have approached the midway point of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, this is an opportune time for reflection on our shared vision for a sustainable world and to undertake recalibrations in areas where more work is needed.@@@In July this year.@@@Brunei Darussalam presented its second voluntary national review report, highlighting our progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).@@@We have made significant strides and are on track across several Goals, in line with our national vision.@@@Wawasan Brunei 2035, which aims to create a dynamic and sustainable economy with a high quality of life for all citizens.@@@However, like many other countries, we too faced challenges.@@@For us, this was mainly in the area of reliable data collection.@@@It has hindered monitoring and evaluating accurately the progress towards achieving the SDGs.@@@Nonetheless, our country is actively working towards addressing that issue, including by working together more closely through our regional mechanisms, namely, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).@@@For example.@@@ASEAN recently signed an agreement to officially launch the ASEAN Centre for Climate Change in Brunei Darussalam.@@@It will facilitate and assist in collecting data towards addressing the challenges of climate action and will serve as a regional hub and research facility that seeks to enhance capacity in our efforts to mitigate and combat climate change.@@@The Centre will be operational by the end of the year, and we welcome any support from interested 
Member States or international organizations for that regional effort.@@@The United Nations has always played, and continues to play, a central role in fostering collaboration, mobilizing resources and coordinating international efforts to bring peace, development and prosperity to all Member States.@@@As we move towards a new global order in a multipolar world, small States such as Brunei Darussalam recognize and appreciate the importance of the United Nations in maintaining international peace and security through a rules-based order.@@@We will continue to uphold the very principles on which this Organization was founded almost eight decades ago, in particular respect for the sovereign equality, territorial integrity and political independence of all States.@@@Therefore.@@@Brunei Darussalam is ready to forge a new global consensus that preserves those values while addressing emerging issues and resolving existing challenges.@@@We look forward to next year’s@@@Summit of the Future and the continued discussions among Member States on the future of global cooperation, including the Secretary-General’s proposed vision under Our Common Agenda (A/75/982).@@@This year’s theme “Rebuilding trust and reigniting global solidarity” builds upon the Secretary-General’s vision for the future of multilateralism that better responds and delivers for the people and the planet and to get the world back on track with the SDGs.@@@Nevertheless, in our increasingly interconnected modern world, trust and solidarity can be achieved only with tolerance and respect.@@@That is why it has been distressing to witness the increase in acts of intolerance and disrespect, particularly acts of religious hatred directed at the Islamic faith.@@@Such deliberate actions, like the burning of the Holy Qur’an, the very centre of the Islamic faith, provokes disharmony, erodes trust, undermines efforts towards sustainable peace and threatens unity.@@@In that regard.@@@Brunei Darussalam joins the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations and those Member States that have called for increased action against religious hatred, especially Islamophobia and anti-Islam sentiments.@@@Justifying religious hatred, even under the pretext of freedom of expression, is unacceptable.@@@Our pursuit of peace will be worthwhile only if we address the root causes of such acts, especially those promoting discord, intolerance, incitement and hatred.@@@No nation represents our collective failure more evidently than the State of Palestine.@@@It has continuously been denied of its fundamental freedoms, safeguarded under the Charter of the United Nations.@@@The seventy-fifth anniversary of the Nakba earlier this year served as a reminder of how long and how intolerable it has been for the Palestinian people to be deprived of their rights to self-rule, self-determination and peace.@@@For most, they have spent their entire lives under occupation.@@@The aggressive policies and practices of the occupying Power have victimized every Palestinian man, woman and child, denying them of all their fundamental and basic human rights and even their ability to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@Brunei Darussalam strongly condemns actions that blatantly violate the rights and dignity of the Palestinian people.@@@We stand firmly in solidarity with them to truly ensure that no one is left behind.@@@The United Nations must strengthen global solidarity in upholding its commitment to the two-State solution as the viable path towards a comprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle East.@@@We reiterate our call for an independent State of Palestine, based on the pre-1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital.@@@After experiencing a global health crisis with far-reaching consequences, we are at a crossroads that will determine our future.@@@One was hoping that we would have emerged more united in our shared resolve.@@@Unfortunately, the reality that we see is quite different.@@@We find ourselves amid humanitarian crises and the global mistrust of international institutions and among States that threaten our collective progress.@@@Therefore, to ensure a better future for generations to come, it is crucial that we refuse to accept actions that divide us or conflicts that oppress us.@@@Above all, we must not let mistrust overpower our unity.@@@I would like to begin by saying that Portugal fully supports the priorities outlined by President Dennis Francis for his term.@@@Allow me also to say a word of gratitude to former President Csaba Korosi, whose term has ended.@@@I applaud Mr. Antonio Guterres.@@@Secretary-General of the United Nations, on behalf of Portugal, for his inexhaustible dedication to the values of the Charter of the United Nations.@@@I support Our Common Agenda (A/75/982) and the reform proposals contained therein for global governance, including those of a financial nature, as well as the priorities that we have never abandoned on climate change, human rights, migrants, refugees and gender equality.@@@Portugal supports the success of the Summit of the Future in 2024; the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations Global Forum, which we will host in Lisbon next year; and the World Social Summit in 2025, which are hallmarks of the Secretary- General’s ongoing clear thinking and dynamism at this demanding juncture for the world in terms of building peace and international cooperation.@@@The President returned to the Chair.@@@We heard today from the Secretary-General as he presented his report (A/78/1).@@@We then heard from 
President Lula da Silva and President Biden who, despite their different positions, agreed on that which is essential.@@@It is urgent that we respect the Charter of the United Nations in order to maintain peace in the world.@@@It is urgent to accelerate the fight against climate change, to achieve the goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and to protect our oceans and biodiversity.@@@In order to guarantee peace, it is urgent that we reform the institutions established in the past century — some of which were established in the first half of the past century — that are so far removed from the reality of the world today.@@@It is urgent that we reform the international financial institutions.@@@As the Secretary-General said, it is time to approve a new Bretton Woods system.@@@Those three matters of urgency are connected.@@@There is no peace and sustainable development nor institutional reform without respect for the Charter of the United Nations.@@@There is no sustainable development nor respect for the Charter of the United Nations without the reform of international institutions.@@@There is no reform of international institutions without respect for the Charter and without achieving the goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and our climate change goals.@@@But that is not the problem.@@@The problem lies elsewhere.@@@Where is the urgency in our urgency?@@@Where is the credibility in us coming here every year to state what is urgent when it is in fact not treated with the appropriate urgency?@@@That has been the appeal of the Secretary-General for many years.@@@It is urgent that we respect the Charter of the United Nations because, without it, and without respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States and for human rights, there can be no peace.@@@In Ukraine, peace is the struggle of the Ukrainian people, as it is for many peoples throughout the world in regions such as the Sahel and many other parts of Africa, in the Near and Middle East and in Asia.@@@The problem is respect for the principles of international law and the Charter of the United Nations.@@@Therefore, we cannot differentiate the struggle of the Ukrainian people from the fight for respect for the United Nations Charter.@@@It is also not possible to build peace without accelerating the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.@@@We are behind — and continued to lag behind — in achieving the Goals, thereby prolonging inequalities among States and among peoples.@@@We cannot achieve the Goals without reforming our international institutions, not least the Security Council.@@@The Security Council corresponds to a world that no longer exists.@@@Portugal has long held that countries such as Brazil and India should be granted permanent membership.@@@The Common African Position should be taken into account, and small countries cannot be ignored.@@@Likewise, the existing financial institutions are incapable of financing sustainable development with equity and justice.@@@They favour the richest and disfavour the poorest.@@@The three matters of urgency are connected and remain so year after year.@@@Portugal defends respect for the United Nations Charter as a path to peace.@@@Portugal defends the intensification of the fight against climate change, trying to move forward with decarbonization, the promotion of clean energy and the protection of our oceans and biodiversity.@@@Portugal defends the reform of institutions such as the United Nations itself and the international financial institutions.@@@We have never ceased and will never cease in our support for the Secretary-General of the United Nations, no matter the cost, because it is easy to come here every year and make the same promises but never deliver on them — not contributing to peace with respect for international law and the United Nations Charter, not contributing to justice and sustainable development and delaying the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@It is easy to come here and promise a new global governance but postpone concrete solutions for institutional reform, talking about providing financing for those who need it without providing examples of such financing.@@@Portugal has just signed an agreement with Cabo Verde — a country home to some of the world’s 300 million Portuguese speakers — to convert State debt into an environmental and climate fund, converting the debtor’s debt into a contribution by the creditor to that State’s sustainable economic development.@@@That should happen systematically with existing debts and financing for sustainable development.@@@It is our goal to extend that initiative to other countries in the Portuguese-speaking community.@@@Year after year, we lose time.@@@But the time has come for us to deliver on respect for international law, on peace-building and on international cooperation.@@@It is time to deliver on correcting global inequalities and on the fight against climate change.@@@It is time to deliver on the reform of the United Nations and of international financial institutions.@@@Without it, multilateralism is not possible.@@@There can be no lasting cooperation nor peace throughout the world.@@@Every day lost is another day of inequality, selfishness, conflict and war.@@@Every day gained is another day of justice, solidarity and peace.@@@I hope that, when we meet a year from now, it will be possible to say that there is more peace than war, and not more war than peace, more justice than injustice, more equality than inequality, more climate action than climate inaction, more reform of the United Nations than less reform and further reform of financial institutions than disregard for, or a reduction in, such reform.@@@If that is the case, it will be worth it.@@@Otherwise, we will always continue to hear all the same very influential people promising and not delivering.@@@We realize why people believe less and less in those who govern them.@@@Allow me, first of all, to congratulate Mr. Dennis Francis, on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session.@@@I am confident that his able stewardship will lead this session to a resounding success.@@@I would also like to thank Mr. Csaba Korosi.@@@President of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session, for his tireless efforts to ensure the success of the previous session.@@@Peace, prosperity, progress and development are the main purposes of the foundation of the United Nations, and they remain the unchanging desire of humankind, as ever.@@@Thanks to the joint efforts of the international community, the global public health emergency is terminated.@@@However, the world has yet to be freed from the sociopolitical instability incurred by the crisis of the malignant coronavirus disease pandemic.@@@This year, disaster-inducing abnormal climate events, such as El Nino, caused extremely high temperatures, droughts, destructive forest fires and heavy rains in many countries and regions around the world, resulting in enormous human and material losses.@@@Such events once again remind us that climate change is a pressing common task to which we should no longer remain indifferent.@@@To make matters worse, some Member States are instigating confrontation between camps and forming blocs in pursuit of hegemony and self-profit.@@@Because of their biased behaviour, conflict and bloodshed among nations, forces and ethnic and religious sects continue unabated in the international arena.@@@In order for humankind to successfully achieve the targets of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development by braving all these crises and challenges, we should seek the correct ways and means to solve problems, while defending multilateralism in the United Nations and promoting unity and cooperation among countries on the basis of international law and the fundamental principles governing international relations.@@@This year, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea celebrated its seventy-fifth anniversary, in commemoration of the 75 years in which it has firmly safeguarded the dignity and sovereignty of the country and nation and has laid a solid foundation for self- respect and prosperity.@@@Even in the face of the manifold trials and challenges, our people are firmly convinced of a thriving future in our increasingly powerful nation.@@@In recent years, global challenges and trials of various kinds created innumerable hardships and difficulties for the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, as well.@@@But my Government achieved encouraging, progressive and proud successes, one after another, in all sectors, including the economy and the improvement of people’s living standards, overcoming those difficulties on its own initiative through its own positive efforts.@@@As the malignant disease mutates into new variants with high transmission rates and immunity evasion and continues to threaten the existence and development of humankind, the Government of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is controlling and managing its anti-epidemic strategy in a stable manner, relying on a science-based and transparent anti-epidemic policy and the strong unity of its entire people to take voluntary action.@@@The Government is also accelerating the building of the State’s anti-epidemic capacity to successfully counter any future health crisis in a proactive manner.@@@It has put considerable effort into developing all sectors of the country in a simultaneous and balanced way.@@@Therefore, all sectors of economic construction are showing a clear trend towards growth, and the agricultural sector has opened prospects for increased stable production even under the unfavourable weather conditions.
Providing the people with affluent and civilized living conditions is the overriding principle that governs the activities of the Workers’ Party of Korea and the Government of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.@@@Their people-first policy has ensured that numerous modern houses were distributed to ordinary workers free of charge this year, as they were last year, and that all children in nurseries and kindergartens are regularly given dairy products on a daily basis at the expense of the State through a well-established and orderly system.@@@The Government of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea has made dynamic efforts to cope with ever-worsening climate change and abnormal, disaster-prone weather conditions.@@@As a result, the protection and improvement of the country’s land and ecological environment are aggressively promoted 
on a nationwide scale, and the material and technical foundations needed to build State resilience against disasters are being laid with a long-term perspective.@@@The achievements made in national economic development and improvement of the people’s livelihood, even amid harsh conditions, is the welcome result of the patriotic and devoted efforts of the entire Korean people, who strive to quickly bring about a happy future for themselves and for posterity by dint of self-reliance and self-development.@@@The Korean people, who aspire to a full and perfect realization of the priority goals of overall national prosperity, must first and foremost defend the security environment and development interests of the State.@@@However, the highhanded and arbitrary practices of some Member States have created an unpleasant situation on the Korea peninsula this year, which runs counter to the theme of the current session and its orientation towards peace, prosperity and progress for all.@@@Owing to the reckless and continued nuclear showdown hysteria of the United States and the forces of its followers.@@@2023 was recorded as an extremely dangerous year, in which the military security situation in and around the Korean peninsula was driven closer to the brink of a nuclear war.@@@Since the beginning of the year, the United States and the Republic of Korea have been making hysterical remarks of confrontation, using such terms as “end of the regime” and “occupation of Pyongyang”, in flagrant violation of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.@@@They staged their largest-ever joint military exercises of a clearly aggressive nature on our doorstep — one after another — including the Freedom Shield.@@@Ssangryong.@@@Combined Joint Fire Annihilation Drill and Ulchi Freedom Shield operations.@@@After fabricating the so-called Nuclear Consultative Group in April, which is committed to the planning, operation and execution of a pre-emptive nuclear strike against the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, the United States has moved on to the practical stage of realizing its sinister intention to provoke a nuclear war, frequently dispatching strategic nuclear submarines and strategic nuclear bombers carrying nuclear weapons to locations in and around the Korean peninsula for the first time in decades.@@@The formation of the tripartite military alliance of the United States.@@@Japan and the Republic of Korea has also put into practice its long-sought ambition for an Asian version of NATO, thereby introducing a new Cold War structure to North-East Asia.@@@The current dangerous situation on the Korean peninsula is attributable to the United States and its attempt to realize its ambition for hegemony by all means, overestimating its powers.@@@But due responsibility also lies with the incumbent Republic of Korea ruling forces, which seek to impose the scourge of a nuclear war on the nation, obsessed with pro-United States submission and fratricidal confrontation.@@@Only a few days ago, in this Hall.@@@Yoon Suk Yeol unreasonably denounced our just and legitimate measures to enhance national defence capabilities, and went as far as to make provocative remarks about the normal development of our cooperative relations with our friendly neighbours (see A/78/PV.6).@@@The development of equal and reciprocal relations among independent sovereign States is not an issue for the Republic of Korea to interfere in, as it is no more than a colony of the United States.@@@Ever since the current puppet Government came to power, the whole area of the Republic of Korea has literally turned into a military colony, a powder keg of war and a military outpost of the United States, due to its sycophantic and humiliating policy of depending on outside forces.@@@Now the Korean peninsula is in a hair-trigger situation and is in imminent danger of the outbreak of nuclear war.@@@The reckless acts of the United States and the forces of its followers are having an irreversibly destructive impact on the regional political and military situations and security structure, as they drive the situation of the Korean peninsula towards an actual armed conflict.@@@Given the prevailing circumstances, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is urgently required to further accelerate the build-up of its self- defence capabilities in order to defend itself and make the country more secure.@@@It is only too natural that, in response to an increasing number of reckless military moves and intensified provocations by the hostile forces that threaten the sovereignty and security interests of our State, our endeavours to enhance national defence capabilities should increase in direct proportion.@@@The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea remains steadfast and unchanged in its determination to firmly defend the nation’s sovereignty and security interests and the well-being of the people against the hostile threats from outside.@@@The United States and the forces of its followers should look back on the consequences of the hostilities they have committed to date, which tarnish the image of our State and gravely infringe upon our security and fundamental interests, and they should make the right choice based on the likely result.@@@Comrade Kim Jong Un.@@@President of the State Affairs of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, said that we should not tolerate the imperialists’ moves for aggression and war against sovereign nations; instead, we should struggle to ward off the danger of war and defend global peace and security.@@@Now the United States is arbitrarily judging other countries by its unilateral hegemonic values and is imposing factional confrontations on them, creating deep divisions and conflicts among States.@@@As the United States seeks political and military collusion on an unprecedented scale in order to allegedly cement an alliance and revive and expand on a global scale such an aggressive military bloc as NATO, whose days are numbered, the world is now faced with the worst security crisis since the Second World War.@@@No country or region in the world can be said to be secure as long as high-handed acts are taken by domineering forces that pose a threat to other nations’ security, while scheming and inciting bloody confrontations, coups d’etat and wars in different parts of the planet in pursuit of their hegemony and expansion.@@@The current reality urgently demands that the United Nations strictly adhere to the principles of impartiality and objectivity and fulfil responsibly its mission and role, as enshrined in the United Nations Charter, in keeping with its mission to save the present and future of humankind from the scourge of war and realize international justice.@@@The issue to be addressed before anything else in United Nations activities is to ensure that the Security Council is not allowed to be used as an instrument of specific forces for pursuing their geopolitical purposes, but strictly observes the principles of objectivity, impartiality and equity, befitting its heavy responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security.@@@It was only a month ago that the Security Council disgracefully convened meetings (see S/PV.9406) to debate as separate agenda items the legitimate right to a satellite launch and a human rights issue relating to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, a full- fledged State Member of the United Nations.@@@The decision by the Security Council to discuss the just and independent right of a sovereign State and to groundlessly take issue with the human rights situation of an individual country amounts to nothing more than an insult to the spirit of the Charter of the United Nations and the deliberate neglect of the Council’s mission.@@@Such actions bear absolutely no relation to the Council’s mandate of maintaining international peace and security.@@@On the contrary, the Security Council has never expressed concern about the nefarious nuclear war exercises carried out by the United States and its acolytes against the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, or about their continued deployment of strategic assets, both of which clearly constitute a threat to the peace and security of the Korean peninsula and the rest of the world.@@@In defiance of strong protests and criticism from the international community.@@@Japan discharged nuclear- contaminated water into the ocean, thereby causing irrevocable damage to the safety of humankind and the marine ecosystem.@@@Nevertheless, the Security Council remains silent, and some permanent members do not even hesitate to resort to the irresponsible act of instigating it.@@@The Security Council’s failure to uphold its inherent duty and responsibility to defend global peace and security has its root cause in the unfair behaviour of, and the double standards applied by, the United States and some Member States obedient to it.@@@If the Security Council does not observe the principles of sovereign equality and respect for sovereignty enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, it will never live up to its reputation of representing the collective will of the Member States, and instead will earn the Council only the shameful name of inner chamber of the United States.@@@In order to prevent the high-handedness and arbitrariness of specific forces, including the United States, in the Security Council, it is essential to reform the irrational Western-led structure of its membership, and to that end to expand and strengthen the representation of developing countries, which make up the absolute majority of the United Nations membership.@@@The Security Council should also stop discrediting sovereign States, interfering in their domestic affairs and fomenting confrontation and division by discussing issues that are detrimental to the Council’s mission and mandate.@@@The delegation of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea avails itself of this opportunity to extend its full support to Cuba, which unwaveringly bears aloft the banner of socialism in the face of the heinous sanctions and blockade and the subversive schemes of the United States.@@@We also strongly reject and condemn the United States economic, commercial and financial 
blockade against Cuba — a decades-long economic genocide — and that country’s designation as a State sponsor of terrorism, and we demand an immediate end to both policy measures.@@@At the same time, we call for the immediate, complete and unconditional withdrawal of all coercive and unjustifiable measures against Syria.@@@Venezuela.@@@Iran and other independent countries.@@@We also express our steadfast support for, and solidarity with, the Palestinian people in their righteous cause to regain their legitimate national rights, including the establishment of an independent State with East Al-Quds as its capital.@@@Independence, peace and friendship are the foreign policy ideas consistently championed by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.@@@Moreover, in the future we will forge unity and cooperation with all countries and nations that aspire to independence and love justice, while opposing and rejecting aggression, intervention, domination and subordination, regardless of differences in ideas and systems.@@@We will also expand and develop diversified exchanges and cooperation with capitalist countries that respect our country and are friendly to us.@@@The President of the Republic of Cameroon.@@@His Excellency Mr. Paul Biya, did me the honour of representing him at the work of the seventy-eighth session of the General Assembly and has instructed me to deliver the following speech on his behalf.@@@“Allow me at the outset to extend Cameroon’s WARM congratulations to Mr. Dennis Francis following his election as President of the General Assembly at this session.@@@His extensive experience in multilateral diplomacy and his eminent human qualities allow us to believe that he will be able to lead our work efficiently and successfully.@@@I would therefore like to assure him of my country’s support in carrying out his honourable mission.@@@“I take this opportunity to also congratulate his predecessor.@@@Ambassador Csaba Korosi, who worked to prepare the numerous high-level meetings, the examination of which at the seventy-eighth session involves our future.@@@May he rest assured of the gratitude of Cameroon.@@@“I am also pleased to reiterate to Secretary- General Antonio Guterres all my appreciation for the results he has obtained so far in the exercise of his high and sensitive functions.@@@I renew Cameroon’s full support for its efforts to ensure that our common Organization effectively addresses the multiple challenges facing the world.@@@“Finally, from this rostrum.@@@I would like to reiterate Cameroon’s support and solidarity to the respective Governments and peoples of the Kingdom of Morocco and the Republic of Libya following the recent natural disasters that they have 
suffered, which caused very heavy material loss and claimed many human lives.@@@“The theme chosen for the general debate of this session is ‘Rebuilding trust and reigniting global solidarity: Accelerating action on the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) towards peace, prosperity, progress and the sustainability for all’.@@@The relevance of the theme no longer needs to be demonstrated.@@@Indeed, this seventy-eighth session is being held in a context where tensions and geopolitical rivalries are intensifying, endangering peace, economic, social and cultural development in many countries of Africa.@@@Asia.@@@Latin America and Europe.@@@That is particularly the case in Ukraine and in the Sahel, the Great Lakes and Horn of Africa regions.@@@Those situations undermine the numerous efforts made to overcome the coronavirus disease pandemic, return to growth and development, and effectively fight climate change.@@@“Fortunately, we can be pleased that the international community has mobilized to reach a consensus around certain major issues.@@@That is the case with the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the major agreement on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development that we launched together here in 2015, accompanied by the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on financing for development.@@@Even more recently, we adopted the Ottawa framework convention, as well as the agreement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction.@@@“It is in that same dynamic that Africa is gradually implementing its Agenda 2063 and the African Continental Free Trade Agreement in order to promote a united Africa, an Africa of peace, an Africa of security, an Africa of good governance, an Africa of shared prosperity, an Africa called to play a major role in international relations by 2063.@@@“Despite all those efforts, the expected results are still slow to emerge.@@@What could explain such a situation?@@@Among other reasons, it must be recognized that action has not always followed words.@@@By way of illustration.@@@I note the insufficient mobilization of resources for the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals or the failure to achieve the 0.7 per cent objective set for public development assistance, despite the promises made almost 50 years ago .@@@“Let us also recognize that, sometimes, the resources mobilized have been either late to arrive or distributed sparingly, due to conditionalities.@@@Sometimes, too, it is the timidity of political will that is at fault, when it is simply not absent or altered by selfish considerations that may take precedence over the general interest and active solidarity among peoples and nations.@@@Finally, the tools, mechanisms, institutions and schemes put in place following the Second World War to promote peace, security and economic and social development are no longer as effective and relevant, due to the diversity and complexity of the new realities of the world.@@@“What can we consider now?@@@First, a surge of pride, self-improvement and a new political will are required, as is a new awareness — one that emphasizes the primacy of the general interest; one where science is put at the service of all humankind with a view to ensuring the well-being of each and everyone in such important areas as peace, security, health or economic, social and cultural development.@@@In that regard, we must truly base our action on the Charter of our Organization, its ideals, its principles and its objectives.@@@“We must resolve conflicts through dialogue and consultation.@@@We must promote a pact for a renovated global financial architecture.@@@We must work tirelessly towards the advent of truly equitable global development that allows all regions of the world to aspire to prosperity and growth.@@@That, in any case, is the ambition of Africa, through Agenda 2063 and the establishment of its Continental Free Trade Area, the success of which is expected in areas such as research, science, technology, energy, infrastructure, communications and telecommunications, agriculture and food, debt, climate financing and development in general.@@@“We must finally act together for Security Council reform with a view to giving the countries of the South, and in particular Africa, permanent and equitable representation.@@@Indeed, it should be noted that Africa, in addition to being underrepresented on the Council, is the only continent not to have a permanent presence within that organ, even though two-thirds of the Council’s activities are devoted 
to it.@@@That is, frankly, an injustice that must be corrected.@@@It is why we reaffirm our support for the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration, by calling for two additional permanent and three non-permanent positions for Africa on the Security Council.@@@“Cameroon is, for its part, determined to honour its commitments in the context of the various circles of solidarity to which it belongs.@@@It was one of the first countries to ratify the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and, in conjunction with the other members of the Congo forest basin, is actively working to find solutions to climate change.@@@Cameroon is also one of the pioneers in the operationalization of the Continental Free Trade Area Agreement and has initiated an implementation plan for the SDGs and Agenda 2063 through the adoption of SND 2030, a national development strategy intended to make it an emerging country by 2035.@@@It has also adopted all the reforms necessary for the promotion of sustainable economic and social development, good governance focused on decentralization in order to allow all citizens to participate fully in the affairs of their country.@@@“On the security front, the fight against Boko Haram continues actively, in concert with the member countries of the Multinational Joint Task Force of the Lake Chad Basin Commission.@@@The results of those efforts are already observable on the ground, although additional efforts should be made.@@@In the North-West and South-West regions in particular, peace and stability are gradually returning thanks to the diligent actions of the Government following the recommendations of the Major National Dialogue, despite episodic cases of violence or the taking of hostages for ransom, orchestrated by the separatists.@@@“The effective implementation by the Government of the Presidential Reconstruction and Development Plan, as well as the operationalization of the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration centres, make it possible to confidently foresee the return of lasting peace and stability and the relaunch of economic and development activities in the two regions.@@@Those efforts will certainly not be in vain.@@@“We take this opportunity to thank once again our bilateral and multilateral partners, who continue to contribute to improving the situation through their support for the various plans put in place by the Government.@@@Their valuable assistance in the fight against the financing of destabilizing activities in those two regions is also appreciated by the Government, which continues to reach out to those who have taken up arms and calls on them to lay them down.@@@“The world is changing.@@@It is therefore up to us to take the appropriate decisions and orientations to make it better, for the well-being of our populations.@@@We can get there so long as we can strengthen our solidarity in order to address our common challenges together.@@@In this era of digital technology and artificial intelligence, we have prodigious tools at our disposal.@@@If used wisely, they can enable us to achieve the desired results to ensure the survival of humankind and guarantee a better future.”@@@At the outset.@@@I would like to congratulate Mr. Dennis Francis on his election as President of the General Assembly at its current session, and to thank his predecessor.@@@Mr. Csaba Korosi, for his presidency at the previous session.@@@I also thank the Secretary-General for the efforts he is making to implement the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations, in accordance with the mandate entrusted to him.@@@Our world today is witnessing important transformations and an increase of serious challenges.@@@foremost of which is the outbreak of devastating conflicts in many regions around the world, the continued occupation of some peoples of the world, the spread of the scourge of terrorism, declining rates of development and a sharp rise in rates of poverty and hunger, in addition to the catastrophic impacts of unilateral coercive measures and economic blockade policies, as well as the negative repercussions of climate change and related natural disasters.@@@We must all confront those challenges as they will affect the future of our upcoming generations.@@@Eliminating them or mitigating their impacts to a minimum requires global cooperation, solidarity and concerted efforts among Member States to build a new multipolar world order that strikes a new balance in international relations, including by reforming international financial institutions and other bodies, especially the Security Council, and achieving true sustainable development that guarantees the benefit and well-being of all peoples of the world.@@@The policies of creative chaos adopted by successive United States administrations in our region to serve their geopolitical and selfish interests have led to the destabilization of security and stability there as they worked to create and exaggerate problems to ignite tensions and then conflicts.@@@They spent billions of dollars to demolish and destroy development achievements made over decades, and contributed to the emergence of the phenomenon of extremism and terrorism, such as the Da’esh and Al-Nusra Front terrorist organizations.@@@Multilateralism, the United Nations Charter and other relevant international conventions have not been spared that creative United States chaos.@@@Over the past 10 years, we have witnessed an increasing tendency to misinterpret and misapply the provisions of the Charter, especially Article 51, and to use them as an excuse to justify attacks on the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of other countries, as well as to manipulate the provisions of international conventions and treaties and to politicize human rights issues to justify interfering in the internal affairs of other countries and exert pressure on them.@@@The basic principle affirmed by the Charter of the United Nations is respect for the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of Member States.@@@Therefore, any acquisition of the lands of others by force is an occupation, and any illegal military presence on the territories of any sovereign State is an explicit violation of the Charter and a clear breach of international law.@@@It must end immediately and unconditionally.@@@Accordingly.@@@Israel’s occupation of the Arab lands in Palestine and the Golan since 1967 to this very day; the consequent construction of settlements; efforts to change the demographic composition and institutional structure, especially through attempts to forcefully impose Israeli citizenship on the people of the Golan, not to mention the plundering of the natural resources of the Golan; the seizure of Syrian farmers’ lands to build huge wind turbines on them, and other documented violations are the most heinous forms of grave and systematic violations of the United Nations Charter and international humanitarian law.@@@The Syrian Arab Republic reaffirms its legitimate right to recover the entire occupied Syrian Golan up to the line of 4 June 1967, no matter how long it takes.@@@That is an inalienable right that is not subject to compromise, pressure or any statute of limitations.@@@It is guaranteed by international law and relevant United Nations resolutions, especially Security Council resolution 497 (1981).@@@Syria also stresses that it will exercise its legitimate right to defend its territories and people by all necessary means and to ensure that the Israeli occupation authorities are held accountable for all their crimes, with no impunity.@@@Syria has supported and continues to support the Palestinian question, as it is the central Arab cause.@@@Syria has spared no effort to stand alongside the brotherly Palestinian people in their legitimate struggle to regain their legitimate rights, especially their right to establish their independent State on their land, with Jerusalem as its capital, and to attain Palestine’s full membership of the United Nations.@@@What we have witnessed during this year of dangerous escalation of Israeli criminal practices, in which the number of victims has reached its highest level yet, is pushing the region into unprecedented tension and instability.@@@That is evident in Israel’s commission of more massacres, the escalation of its military aggression and its repeated missile attacks on Syrian cities, ports and civil airports, which have endangered civilian lives and the safety of civil aviation, and hampered United Nations humanitarian operations.@@@Moreover, it has pursued its policies of settlement.@@@Judaization, siege, arbitrary arrest, forced 
displacement and racial discrimination in the occupied Arab territories.@@@While the Syrian Arab Republic condemns in the strongest terms all those Israeli crimes and attacks, it equally denounces the continued support for such practices or silence about them on the part of some countries that declare themselves protectors of international humanitarian law and human rights law, which makes them complicit with the perpetrators of those crimes and clearly demonstrates the double standards they practice.@@@Israel’s continued occupation of Arab lands and its brutal practices are consistent with the destructive role played by some countries on Syrian lands.@@@The United States and Türkiye continue to violate Syria’s sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity by insisting on perpetuating their illegal military presence on Syrian lands and supporting separatist militias and terrorist organizations.@@@This is in addition to the infiltration of Western political and military officials and others into Syrian territory, without any respect for Syria’s sovereignty and independence.@@@That is a flagrant interference in its internal affairs.@@@The systematic and exposed United States plunder of the Syrian people’s national wealth, such as oil, gas and wheat, has deprived the Syrians of their resources and exacerbated their humanitarian suffering in an unprecedented manner.@@@Our latest statistics show that the total value of the direct and indirect losses caused to the oil sector in Syria has exceeded $115 billion.@@@We believe that the United Nations is obligated to hold the United States accountable and compel it to return that looted money to the Syrian Government.@@@In parallel with all of that, the United States of America and its European allies continue to impose unilateral, illegal, immoral and inhumane coercive measures on various sectors in Syria, which has only exacerbated the suffering of Syrians wherever they are, given that their impact includes third countries.@@@The Secretary-General has noted in his reports the impact of those measures on United Nations procurement and payments.@@@Those countries intentionally include in their measures the public health sector, the banking sector, the air transport sector.@@@Syrian civil aviation equipment and the energy sector, including a ban on the supply of oil and its derivatives to Syria or the import of power plants, equipment related to power generation and spare parts.@@@They also include a prohibition on importing equipment and machinery necessary for drinking water supply, irrigation, water sterilization and purification, and the repair and improvement of the sewage system.@@@The agricultural sector has not been spared from those unilateral sanctions, which include a ban on the import of the fertilizers and machinery necessary for agricultural production that provides food for the Syrians.@@@Syria was one of the most stable and prosperous countries in the world.@@@It was achieving food self- sufficiency and providing all the basic necessities of life for its people in a way that was rarely seen in the region.@@@However, the terrorist war that has been waged against it since 2011 has changed that situation and caused a significant humanitarian crisis whose severity was aggravated by the imposition of unilateral coercive measures.@@@Recently, the devastating earthquake that struck Syria on 6 February added a new burden and suffering.@@@The earthquake destroyed hundreds of buildings, infrastructure and service facilities, claimed thousands of victims and injured many more, and made tens of thousands homeless.@@@The Syrian Government has taken all measures to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid and relief workers to all affected areas.@@@It has granted and continues to grant open approvals to the United Nations and international organizations working in Syria to facilitate and accelerate the entry of emergency relief supplies to support those affected, including the opening, by sovereign decision, of border crossings to facilitate the humanitarian response for the sake of Syrians in the affected areas under the control of terrorist organizations in north-western Syria.@@@In that regard, the Syrian Arab Republic reiterates its thanks and appreciation to all countries that have stood in solidarity with Syria and its people and rushed to respond to the needs of the Syrian people in light of the difficult circumstances they have faced.@@@It also expresses its appreciation to the Secretary-General for launching the flash appeal to respond to the catastrophic repercussions of the earthquake.@@@The Syrian Government is still continuing, within its limited capabilities, to make every effort to address the impacts of the earthquake in the four affected governorates.@@@The President of the Republic issued in May a decree establishing the National Fund to Support those Affected by the Earthquake, with the aim of providing them with financial support and helping them 
overcome the resulting physical, material or moral harm.@@@The decree represented the foundation of the basic directions and the national action plan approved by the Syrian Government to deal with the repercussions of the earthquake in their various aspects, and to move from the emergency response phase of relief work to the recovery phase from its impacts.@@@The Syrian Arab Republic reiterates that improving the humanitarian situation in Syria will require providing sustainable solutions to support the Syrians, especially after the earthquake, by increasing the size and quantity of early recovery projects in a way that reduces dependence on life-saving humanitarian aid, increases the Syrians’ resilience and establishes conditions for a dignified and voluntary return of displaced persons and refugees to their homes.@@@However, that will require providing the necessary funding through the fulfilment by international donors of the pledges they have made.@@@Turning to the return of refugees, the Syrian Arab Republic declares from this rostrum its readiness to welcome the return of all Syrian refugees who left their homes, villages or cities.@@@We call on our citizens who were forced by terrorist organizations to seek refuge to return to their homeland.@@@The Syrian Government has taken all necessary decisions in that regard and is cooperating with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the Arab Contact Committee to reach that noble goal.@@@In that regard.@@@I call on Western countries that have been asking refugees not to return to their homeland to end those inhumane practices.@@@In parallel.@@@Syria has responded positively to the efforts and initiatives presented within the framework of the political track.@@@It has supported the approach of local settlements and national reconciliation as a way to restore conditions to normalcy in various parts of the country and to strengthen national unity and the cohesion of Syrian society.@@@It has participated in the meetings held in the Astana format, welcomed their results and maintained communication with the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Syria.@@@The Arab Summit that was held in May in Jeddah, in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, made a great achievement by restoring the resplendence of the collective Arab position and the momentum of Arab joint action.@@@At the Summit, the Arab countries affirmed their support for Syria in its efforts to preserve its sovereignty and territorial integrity and to overcome the difficult circumstances it is enduring as a result of the terrorist war it has faced, the economic sanctions imposed on it and the repercussions of the devastating earthquake that struck it.@@@The Syrian Arab Republic expresses its support and solidarity with the Libyan people in facing the repercussions of the hurricane and floods that struck them, as well as with the Moroccan people as a result of the devastating earthquake there.@@@Syria reaffirms its support for the right of the Russian Federation to defend itself and protect its national security in response to aggressive Western policies.@@@In doing so, it is defending not only itself but also the right of all of us to reject the logic of Western and unipolar hegemony.@@@Syria commends the constructive and responsible approach of the Islamic Republic of Iran regarding its return to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, from which the United States unilaterally and illegally withdrew.@@@It calls on the United States and its Western allies to meet Iran’s legitimate demands.@@@Syria supports the one-China principle and the positions of the People’s Republic of China in confronting attempts to interfere in its internal affairs, whether in Taiwan.@@@Hong Kong or Xinjiang.@@@It stresses China’s inalienable right to take whatever measures and steps it deems necessary to defend its sovereignty, especially in confronting the unprecedented escalation and provocation policy practiced by the United States of America against it.@@@Syria condemns the unjust economic blockade imposed on Cuba for decades, including the United States Administration’s extension of the so-called Trading with the Enemy Act.@@@Syria calls for an end to the military action and exercises conducted by the United States on the Korean peninsula, which have led to escalation of tension in that region.@@@Syria also demands the lifting of all forms of unilateral coercive measures imposed by Western countries on the Russian Federation.@@@Iran.@@@Venezuela.@@@Belarus.@@@Nicaragua, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.@@@Zimbabwe.@@@Eritrea and my country.@@@Syria, and considers them to be a form of economic terrorism, which is no less brutal and dangerous than armed terrorism in its catastrophic humanitarian effects on the targeted peoples.@@@In conclusion, the General Assembly was created to be a platform for dialogue and public diplomacy among Member States, and not a platform for levelling false accusations or launching hostile campaigns against each other.@@@That is why we look forward to the current session of the General Assembly, under President Francis’s leadership, being able to fulfil the theme he has set, namely.@@@“Rebuilding trust and reigniting global solidarity: Accelerating action on the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals towards peace, prosperity, progress and the sustainability for all.”@@@That requires translating the theme into real and serious action that helps give all countries fair opportunities that ensure no one is left behind, and also strengthens the position and status of the General Assembly as the most representative organ of the United Nations.@@@May I begin by congratulating Mr. Dennis Francis on his election as President of the General Assembly at it seventy-eighth session.@@@I also wish to convey my appreciation to Mr. Csaba Korosi for his sterling leadership of the seventy-seventh session of the General Assembly.@@@Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also deserves our gratitude for his inspiring and commendable initiatives in furthering the objectives of our Organization.@@@It is a matter of great pride to see a fellow islander preside over the proceedings of the seventy-eighth session of the General Assembly, especially at a time when the world is faced with a myriad of interlocking challenges amidst conflicts, climate chaos, inequality and hunger.@@@Let me assure him of the commitment of Mauritius to the principles that the United Nations stands for, and the hopes and aspirations that we all have in the United Nations.@@@Mauritius is firmly committed to fulfilling its responsibilities as a Member of the United Nations.@@@Let me also seize this opportunity to express to the Governments and the peoples of the Kingdom of Morocco and the State of Libya our solidarity at this tragic moment.@@@The theme of this year’s general debate could not be timelier.@@@It is about how we can together restore confidence in our shared future — confidence between people and leaders, confidence in our institutions and among countries.@@@Unless we urgently begin to rebuild this trust, it will prove impossible to tackle the challenges we have to face.@@@No country, no matter how powerful or wealthy, can succeed in tackling the current challenges on its own.@@@Our fate and fortunes have never been so closely linked.@@@Indeed, the world is at a critical inflection point as it faces unprecedented and interlocking crises, with the multilateral system being under greater strain.@@@The information and communications technology revolution has increased connections and complexities in our daily lives.@@@The list of problems is daunting, from a lingering coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, climate change, declining biodiversity, food and energy insecurity, cybercrime, terrorism, large-scale migration, gender inequality and a general pushback against human rights, to inadequate development financing, increasing debt burdens and geopolitical crises.@@@Our national borders are no match for those challenges.@@@Effective multilateral response is the only way to address geopolitical challenges and rescue our common agenda.@@@We have to give new direction to multilateralism and to the United Nations.@@@We need to restore trust in multilateralism.@@@As leaders of the world, we should lead by example, show our unwavering commitment and honour the promises made.@@@More importantly, we need to uphold fairness and justice.@@@In that regard, finding consensus on such crucial priorities as poverty eradication, renewable energy, education and women’s empowerment is paramount.@@@The Sustainable Development Goals serve as our guiding compass on that journey.@@@In a world marred by inequalities, our commitment to uplifting the marginalized and empowering the vulnerable must remain steadfast.@@@We must ensure inclusivity where every individual feels safe and secure.@@@Our society’s strength lies in its diversity.@@@An efficient education system is vital in order to achieve such inclusivity.@@@Everyone will need to possess an evolving pool of knowledge, skills and capacities, or else we will have a two-speed world deepening inequalities and exacerbating global instability.@@@We need to build an integrated system of lifelong learning and ensure equity, access and inclusion in relevant curricula.@@@We should work together towards harnessing digital tools and increase investment in education so that it is recognized as a global public good.@@@The surge in health challenges, from non-communicable diseases to global pandemics like COVID-19, underscores the importance of global unity.@@@By fostering cooperation and sharing resources and expertise, we can ensure universal access to the highest standard of health care in order to protect the vulnerable and strengthen our global resilience.@@@Scaled-up action to reduce emissions to align with goals set forth in the Paris Agreement on Climate Change is becoming imperative.@@@Even within the 1.5°C goal, the small island developing States (SIDS) are facing an existential threat.@@@Exceeding that threshold would be catastrophic.@@@To secure a sustainable future, we must collectively phase out fossil fuel usage and hasten the just transition to sustainable energy sources, targeting net zero emissions globally by 2050.@@@The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change sixth assessment report has already warned that further delay will mean missing “a brief and rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all”.@@@SIDS like Mauritius wrestle with coastal erosion, marine pollution, and coral bleaching.@@@Sea-level rise and climate-related disasters loom large.@@@Mauritius is facing a rise in sea level of 5.6 millimetres annually, almost twice the global average of 3.3 millimetres.@@@Those compounding challenges heighten our inherent vulnerabilities and imperil our sustainable development objectives.@@@As leaders, it is our duty and responsibility to save the planet for our future generations.@@@Mauritius is spending about 2 per cent of its gross domestic product (GDP) on environment and climate change-related policies.@@@Our Climate Change Act serves as the cornerstone of our commitment to fulfilling our obligations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Kyoto Protocol, the Paris Agreement, and other related instruments on climate change.@@@In order to build our resilience.@@@Mauritius has implemented a series of adaptation measures such as coastal rehabilitation, mangrove propagation and flood management programmes.@@@We have also formulated a nationally appropriate mitigation actions for low-carbon strategy.@@@Mauritius is also committed to implementing a series of adaptation and mitigation measures aimed at reducing its greenhouse-gas emissions by 40 per cent and achieving 60 per cent of energy production from green sources by 2030.@@@In order to ensure the successful implementation of our national determined contributions, a total of $6.5 billion is required.@@@Despite the economic constraints, we have been able to commit $2.5 billion.@@@Our challenge is to secure the remaining $4 billion.@@@Indeed, all SIDS need adequate and predictable support, including climate finance, from the international community.@@@We call on the international financial institutions and development partners to ensure that access to climate finance by SIDS is simplified and made easier.@@@We look forward to the swift operationalization of the Loss and Damage Fund agreed upon at the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.@@@That facility represents hope for those in urgent need and cannot remain a mere promise.@@@Developed countries must urgently deliver on their promise made 14 years ago at the United Nations Climate Change Conference, held in Copenhagen, to provide climate finance of $100 billion per year.@@@As it is, that amount is no longer sufficient, so there is a need to 
make the scale of climate finance commensurate with the challenge through the new collective quantified goal on climate finance.@@@We urge the international financial institutions to recognize that GDP per capita is not the sole measure of a country’s development.@@@We call on the international financial institutions and development partners to use the multidimensional vulnerability index developed by the United Nations as a tool in further integrating SIDs vulnerability into their decision-making.@@@SIDs are hopeful that the fourth International Conference on SIDS in Antigua and Barbuda will deliver a more focused, measurable and fully resourced programme of action that is tailored to the circumstances of SIDs.@@@We look to the Summit of the Future in 2024 to address issues of financial stability, promote financial inclusion and debt sustainability and embrace sustainability.@@@We call for an inclusive and equitable global governance and not a finance divide.@@@Mauritius believes firmly that the SDG Stimulus and the Bridgetown Initiative can accelerate progress towards the SDGs and the Paris Agreement.@@@The United Nations report SIDS in Numbers: Biodiversity and Oceans projects that Mauritius will become a water-stressed country by 2025, barely two years from now.@@@It is my Government’s top priority to ensure the continuous supply of clean and safe water to every citizen.@@@We will continue to invest in water storage capacities to face the effects of climate change and achieve long-term water security.@@@The ocean, on which we are all dependent, is a critical reservoir of marine biodiversity.@@@Mauritius welcomes the adoption of the agreement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction, and I am pleased to inform the Assembly that Mauritius has signed the agreement.@@@That historic legally binding instrument is a victory for multilateralism and international law and a game-changer towards the conservation and sustainable use of marine resources.@@@We encourage all countries to sign and ratify the agreement so that it can enter into force as soon as possible.@@@In the same vein.@@@Mauritius reiterates its invitation to States, non-governmental organizations and other stakeholders to support the marine protected area that Mauritius will be establishing around the Chagos archipelago.@@@We also look forward to the finalization of the international, legally binding instrument on plastic pollution, including in the marine environment, and to ensuring its effective implementation.@@@Democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights are fundamental values that every country must respect and abide by.@@@The instability in some parts of Africa is detrimental to progress.@@@Upholding the rule of law is essential to restoring faith in governance, fostering stability, and enabling sustainable progress on the continent.@@@The peaceful transition of power through democratic means is the only way to ensure peace, development and prosperity.@@@We proudly welcome the admission of the African Union as a member of the Group of 20.@@@We reaffirm our solidarity with the Palestinian people and reiterate our unwavering support for the two-State solution, as we recognize its potential to bring lasting peace and stability to the region.@@@We commend the recent step taken to seek an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice and hope that the Palestinian people will be able to live in freedom in their own State.@@@As we navigate through an increasingly complex path, it is crucial that we adapt our global institutions to effectively address the challenges of the twenty- first century.@@@The Security Council has a vital role to play in maintaining international peace and security.@@@However, it no longer reflects the realities of the modern world.@@@Urgent reform of the Security Council and the revitalization of the General Assembly are essential to strengthen the United Nations for future generations.@@@Amidst the Ukraine-Russia conflict, the international community must relentlessly pursue peaceful dialogue.@@@We commend African nations and other mediators for their vital role in that regard.@@@It is now four years since the International Court of Justice gave its advisory opinion on the legal consequences of the separation of the Chagos archipelago from Mauritius prior to its independence.@@@The International Court of Justice made it clear that the Chagos archipelago is an integral part of the territory of Mauritius and invited the colonial Power to withdraw its administration from the archipelago as rapidly as possible.@@@Ever since, the Government of Mauritius has made a strong commitment to implementing a programme of resettlement in the Chagos archipelago for Mauritian nationals, in particular those of 
Chagossian origin, who have suffered historic injustice by being forcibly removed from their birthplace.@@@We are hopeful that they will soon be able to resettle in the Chagos archipelago.@@@Indeed.@@@Mauritius and the United Kingdom have started negotiations on the exercise of sovereignty over the Chagos archipelago, on the basis of international law.@@@We hope that those talks will lead to the completion of the decolonization process of Mauritius and enable Mauritius to implement its resettlement programme.@@@We also appeal to France to resolve the dispute over Tromelin, which forms an integral part of the territory of Mauritius, in the spirit of friendship that characterizes the relations between the two countries.@@@We are at a crossroads.@@@We do not want to be judged by the next generation for having been complacent.@@@Let us seize this opportunity to recommit to forging the future we want for us and for our future generations.@@@I remain confident that we will discover the common purpose needed to restore trust in our shared future.@@@On behalf of His Excellency Captain Ibrahim Traore, transitional President and Head of State.@@@I convey the warm greetings of the people and the Government of Burkina Faso.@@@On behalf of the people of Burkina Faso.@@@I pay a humble tribute to the memory of those great world leaders who embodied the hopes and dreams for a just and equitable world through their commitment, determination and spirit of sacrifice.@@@I am thinking in particular of Fidel Castro of Cuba.@@@Patrice Emery Lumumba of the Congo.@@@Modibo Keita of Mali.@@@Ruben Um Nyobe and Felix Mournie of Cameroon.@@@Sylvanus Olympic of Togo.@@@Che Guevara of Argentina.@@@Martin Luther King and Malcolm X of the United States of America.@@@Nelson Mandela of South Africa.@@@Jomo Kenyatta of Kenya.@@@Amilcar Cabral of Guinea-Bissau and Cabo Verde.@@@Marien Ngouabi of the Republic of the Congo and Captain Thomas Isidore Noel Sankara of Burkina Faso, among others.@@@Most of those leaders were executed violently; others were assassinated, dying in prison or by poisoning.@@@Their only crime in each case was embodying the dreams, ambitions and hopes of peoples that had been wounded, raped, violated and pillaged.@@@My intention as I stand at this lofty rostrum before the United Nations on behalf of Burkina Faso, a country of upstanding people, is not to beat my breast in lamentation or to make a predictable speech.@@@I was sent here, instead, as a sacrificial lamb to tell the Assembly that State lies, diplomatic hypocrisy, the thirst for power, the frenetic quest for profit, the diabolical spirit of domination and exploitation of man by man — those are the true wounds that poison our coexistence and drive all societies toward perdition, including our Organization.@@@Allow me to here cite excerpts from the statements delivered from this very rostrum, at the opening of this seventy-eighth session, by His Excellency Secretary- General Antonio Guterres; His Excellency Mr. Joe Biden.@@@President of the United States; His Excellency Mr. Dennis Francis.@@@Permanent Representative of Trinidad and Tobago to the United Nations, elected President of the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session; and His Excellency Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.@@@President of the Republic of Brazil, respectively.
Let me quote from the first statement:
“Our world is becoming unhinged”.@@@“Bodies are washing ashore from the same Mediterranean Sea where billionaires sunbathe”, (see A/78/PV.4)
And from the second:
“We gather once more at an inflection point in world history ...@@@[We have] a common cause ...@@@[and] share a common vision of the future of the world in which our children do not go hungry” (ibid).@@@The third states:
“In spite of the many .., challenges we face, we do have the capacity to effect change. ...@@@We do not lack capacity.@@@What we lack is the will to act .., we can deliver .., peace, progress, prosperity and sustainability to everyone, everywhere”, (ibid.)@@@Fourthly, the President of Brazil mentioned the issues of dissonance and of the Security Council’s paralysis, adding:
“The United Nations needs to fulfil its role as a builder of a world with greater solidarity, fraternity and fairness, but it can do so only if its members have the courage to proclaim their discontent at inequality”, (ibid.)@@@The quintessence of those statements by four eminent persons clearly shows that the inequality throughout the world is deliberate.@@@Otherwise, we would be able, with a modicum of courage and political will, if not to eradicate it, at least to minimize it.@@@Indeed, every year we hear a multiplicity of speeches, as well as promises and commitments.@@@But the proof of the dissonance between rhetoric and facts on these issues relating to Charter principles, including justice, equality, dignity, integrity, self-determination, the sovereignty of States, the inviolability of territory and respect for international law lies in what is happening in Libya; in the Sahel, especially the Niger; and the crisis between Russia and Ukraine.@@@First, in Libya, thousands of people lost their lives in the catastrophic flooding there.@@@To assuage their consciences, every nation rushed to offer its condolences and solidarity.@@@That was, of course, to give the impression that we are living in society and that there are values that we defend.@@@Intellectual honesty requires and the history of our consciences tells us that we should sincerely apologize to the Libyan people for having — collectively and individually, whether through reprehensible passivity or active complicity — sided with the butchers who caused the first man-made disaster in Libya.@@@It was that disaster that brought Libya to its knees by looting it and killing its leader, before the flooding plunged it into even deeper sorrow.@@@Unfortunately, that human disaster was spearheaded by the United Nations under resolution 1970 (2011) and enabled by the guilty silence, if not complicity, of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the African Union.@@@That macabre intervention, led by Nicolas Sarkozy’s France, killed the Libyan leader.@@@Colonel Muammar Al-Qadhafi, on 20 October 2011.@@@If condolences to the Libyan people had a modicum of common sense and were not hypocritical, that murderous diplomacy would never have taken place around the case of the Niger to create a second Libya there.@@@Next, as proof that international relations are tinged with a high level of diplomatic hypocrisy, devoid of conscience, morality, dignity, integrity, justice and, hence, peace, there is still same posturing in an outrageously deadly line-up swarming around like wild beasts to devour its wounded prey.@@@Today we have come to the unfortunate realization that, contrary to the addresses made in good faith from this United Nations rostrum, calling for respect for the United Nations Charter and international law, the leaders representing the brotherly people of the Niger have been virtually barred from access to Headquarters.@@@Burkina Faso strongly condemns that despicable tactic, which is based on practices that belong to the past.@@@That can clearly be done only by minds that have lost the values vital to any harmonious life in society.@@@We therefore stress that the United Nations must never be a tool in the hands of any country.@@@The pan-Africanist leaders who fought for African unity, our grandparents who fell with dignity under the murderous bullets of the colonialists and worthy African sons who sacrificed themselves for the honour on the continent and fought hard against the slave trade and neo-colonialism, had their warrior’s slumber disturbed to hear that a handful of Africa’s lost children are holding the Niger like cottonwool for the invader to set on fire.@@@Yes.@@@I say to the dear African continent that a handful of its children decided to humiliate and vilify it through shameless State lies, starting with the Niger.@@@I therefore launch a heartfelt and fervent appeal to the Senegalese.@@@Beninese.@@@Nigerian.@@@Ghanaian.@@@Chadian.@@@Ivorian.@@@Comorian.@@@Bissau-Guinean and all African peoples to rally together in African brotherhood and solidarity to prevent the imperialists from igniting the Niger, as they did to Libya.@@@From this United Nations rostrum and before the whole world.@@@I urge that ECOWAS, the African Union and the United Nations urgently transform into genuine organizations of peoples instead of bodies of a minority of Heads of State.@@@They must not be used and exploited to destabilize brother countries by assassinating their leaders.@@@Only then will the United Nations Charter and international law have any meaning.@@@Lastly, speaking of the United Nations Charter and international law, a conflict between Russia and Ukraine is being fomented and nurtured by certain Powers.@@@Several Western countries, in particular the United States and those of the European Union, have therefore poured in all kinds of support, especially military.@@@Ukrainian civilians, engaged as volunteers, some of whom even drive tanks, are congratulated and called patriots.@@@Mali, the Niger and Burkina Faso are facing a war imposed on them by imperialism under the guise of terrorists of all stripes, spreading terror and desolation.@@@Despite the existence of that same United Nations Charter, with its principles of equality and justice, on the one hand, and, on the one hand, the very international law invoked at this United Nations rostrum, there is clearly an abysmal divide in the way in which such issues are dealt with.@@@Taking the case of Burkina Faso, the civilian population, faced with barbaric and murderous incursions by terrorists, decided to join forces with the defence and security forces.@@@Such people thus engaged, trained and supervised by the defence and security forces, are called Volunteers for the Defence of the Homeland.@@@In Burkina Faso, we have 58.000 such volunteers, including 42.000 communal volunteers and 16.000 national volunteers, fighting on all fronts alongside the 
defence and security forces, trained, supervised and guided by them.@@@They act only under the instruction and supervision of the defence and security forces, in accordance with regulations to protect their lives and property.@@@Certain ECOWAS and African Union Heads of State, at the instigation of capitalist imperialist Powers, are trying to make the international community believe that those patriots are militias.@@@That is the shameless State lie.@@@If the international community were honest and sincere in its commitment to combating terrorism, civilian populations would not continue to become involved and train to defend themselves.@@@Speaking of a lack of openness on the part of that international community, here are some examples.@@@First, when Mali.@@@Burkina Faso, the Niger and other countries organized themselves along their common borders by pooling their forces to confront terrorism.@@@France came out of nowhere to impose its device, that is, the Group of Five for the Sahel (G-5 Sahel).@@@Today ECOWAS, which suddenly has an intervention force to restore democracies, has announced a contribution of $2 billion.@@@But, since the establishment of the G-5 Sahel to the present day and its own evaporation.@@@ECOWAS has contributed only $25 million.@@@Where, then, is the seriousness in the defence of human life advocated by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights?
Secondly.@@@Burkina Faso has suffered punitive sanctions following the coup d’etat of 30 September 2022.@@@That shady so-called international community, led by France through its local henchmen in Africa, first tried in vain to have a Prime Minister appointed in Burkina Faso.@@@Then, it proceeded, to no avail, to impose ministers in strategic positions within the Burkinabe Government.@@@Finally, it negotiated the maintenance of relations so that Captain Ibrahim Traore would implement whatever it decided, as a sine qua non condition for remaining in power for as long as desirable.@@@Having also refused, in the name of his people’s best interests, an onslaught of repressive measures, threats and attempted coups d’etat, unethical schemes are being devised in criminal workshops.@@@Unfortunately, all those schemes and grisly operations are steered by puppets controlled remotely by figures from African presidential corridors.@@@That is why even the famous Accra Initiative did not last long without Mali.@@@Thirdly, in addition to the cuts in aid and the cancellation of training agreements for our defence and security forces, we are witnessing the blocking of our military equipment ordered through the hard-earned sweat of our compatriots, again at the behest of France.@@@For example, for the airborne delivery systems needed to control and defend our country, we had a contract with Brazil, for which the weapons licence was to come from Belgium and the guidance and firing system and cameras from the United States of America, and then an engine from Canada.@@@Today those resources are disingenuously and viciously blocked.@@@At this United Nations rostrum, people speak of defending human rights.@@@I therefore urge that our weapons be immediately delivered to defend and protect our battered populations.@@@In any case, they are formally seized of the matter and, if nothing is done, history will hold them responsible for failing to assist people at risk.@@@Does that bleak picture of the international community, characterized by failing to assist a State in the grip of terrorism, international hypocrisy@@@, the dominance of some Powers within the United Nations, complicity in the plundering of Africa, et cetera, not call for the international community to be brought before the International Criminal Court?@@@In a word, our security will first and foremost be ensured by ourselves, not by anyone else.@@@On the issue of the Wagner Group’s presence in Burkina Faso, which is raised by some media controlled remotely by the Ely see Palace.@@@I would like to say the following.@@@Yes, we are the Wagner Group of Burkina Faso.@@@Yes, those brave defence and security forces and the Volunteers for the Defence of the Homeland are the Wagner Group of Burkina Faso.@@@From this United Nations rostrum.@@@I therefore applaud the sacrifice of every patriot in the name of the national interest.@@@I pay tribute to the memory of all those who fell with their weapons in their hands.@@@And I commend the courage and integrity of those who are still alive and relentlessly and selflessly charging towards the victory of our people and the protection of our homeland.@@@Instead of helping us to halt that human bloodletting, we are met with spurious accusations and shameless State lies, shrouded in hypocritical diplomacy and veiled threats, telling us which partners to go to and what to do.@@@We say no.@@@In the name of the same United Nations Charter and international law to which everyone here at this rostrum refers, the African peoples in general and the Sahelian peoples in particular are resolutely committed to absolutely and fully embracing their total emancipation in order to achieve genuine social progress.@@@Burkina 
Faso will therefore enter into sovereign partnerships with whomever it wishes and buy its defence equipment from whomever it chooses.@@@Whether the country is called Russia.@@@Iran.@@@Turkey.@@@Azerbaijan.@@@Cuba.@@@Nicaragua or North Korea.@@@Burkina Faso will freely buy and sell its products there, without any intermediary, let alone authorization from whomsoever, come what may.@@@Still talking about hypocrisy and State lies, regarding the fight against terrorism in general and in the Sahel in particular, here are some other facts of which I am sure Member States are aware.@@@First, in the Sahel we have almost 10.000 soldiers from foreign armies, mostly French soldiers, but also American.@@@German and Italian soldiers, et cetera, with some of the world’s most sophisticated weapons and flight and surveillance equipment, yet no one see columns of hundreds of terrorists moving in to spread desolation and death, often with unimaginable weapons.@@@In Mali, the Niger and Burkina Faso, there is no arms or munitions factory, so who recruits those terrorists?@@@Who trains them?@@@Who continues to equip them?@@@Who feeds them and with what means?@@@Do you believe in such philanthropy, in the name of which Westerners are going to send their soldiers to the Sahel to die for the good of the Sahelians?@@@If so, what justifies the annoyance and other puerile diplomatic posturing as soon as France is told to pull out militarily?@@@The real reason is the underground resources in the Sahel.@@@The French National Assembly adopted Law No. 057-27 of 10 January 1957, published in the Journal officiel de la Repiibliqiie francaise of 12 January 1957, establishing the Common Organization of the Saharan Regions, which brings together parts of Mali.@@@Burkina Faso, the Niger.@@@Mauritania.@@@Algeria, et cetera.@@@That area has no equal in the world in terms of subsoil wealth.@@@By way of example, the largest water table stretches from Mauritania to Somalia, passing through Mali.@@@Algeria.@@@Libya, the Niger, et cetera.@@@The newspaper Le Monde of 23 July 1957 put forward the figure of 6 to 7 million tons of oil as the potential annual production of the Sahara.@@@In addition to those natural resources, we have uranium, gold, cobalt, zinc, diamonds, lithium, copper and so on.@@@If Westerners are so fond of the Sahel that they bring their soldiers there to die in the name of democracy, freedom, human rights and peace, why is it that the entire African continent — which has 1.3 billion inhabitants, making it the second most populous continent, with 30.415.873 square kilometres and 54 States — has no permanent seat on the Security Council with a right of veto?@@@Is not that more than a State crime?@@@It is a United Nations crime.@@@Let us therefore stop the blatant diplomatic lie that those imperialist Powers come to the Sahel to defend democracy and human rights.@@@Speaking of human rights.@@@I recall that the first charter in the world on the issue of human rights was the Kouroukan Fouga Charter of 1236 in Mande, now Mali.@@@So let the expansionist moralists keep their rhetoric of respect for all kinds of human rights for the terrorists whom they support.@@@Secondly.@@@Africa does not like to compare the dead.@@@It would be ill-mannered to do so.@@@Consequently.@@@I respectfully pay tribute to the memory of people of all nationalities who lost their lives in Africa in general and in the Sahel in particular.@@@Thus, regarding the rash, condescending and unfortunate outbursts by President Emmanuel Macron, which often verge on the ridiculous, while glorifying in a conjectural scorn for the people of Africa.@@@I feel it my duty to give him a little history lesson on his own history.@@@That is why classrooms are designed — for children to learn their lessons and grow up well rather than indulging in something else and risk being lost forever.@@@But, to start with.@@@I would like to point out that no African people has ever been against the French people.@@@There is therefore no anti-French sentiment in Africa, and there never will be, because of our legendary hospitality and love of others.@@@The fact is that the people of Africa condemn condescension, arrogance, insolence, smugness, paternalism, the plundering of its resources and organized crime.@@@For the record.@@@I would first like to remind Mr. Emmanuel Macron of the appeal to Africa made by his own elder.@@@General De Gaulle, on 14 June 1940 over the British Broadcasting Corporation in England to come and save France from the clutches of the Nazis.@@@As a reminder, we have 17.000 Malians who died during the two world wars in a blood debt that France seems to have concealed.@@@For those who wish, they need only to see the book by Bakari Kamian.@@@Associate Professor at the Sorbonne University.@@@In addition, in that same text, on page 344, in table 21, entitled “Sudanese veterans of the two wars”, it lists a total of 82.208 fallen combatants from Mali.@@@Burkina Faso and the Niger, and there were 154.519 combatants from French West Africa mobilized — compare the source Henri Liger’s end-of-mission report in French West Africa.@@@Dakar.@@@13 July 1950.@@@Senegal archives, reference 4D68 (89), see annex 5.@@@Then, on 17 November 1986.@@@Francois Mitterrand, the French President at the time, in response to Captain Thomas Sankara, said:
“Africa has been plundered.@@@I spoke of raw materials.@@@I should have spoken of people.@@@For centuries, we exploited you as human beings; we stole your men, your women, your children.@@@We used you.@@@I understand your refusal, your revolt, and I approve of your struggle.@@@You are right to refuse to be a sacrificed continent.@@@The time has come when you yourselves must develop your economies on the basis of its goods and its people.@@@And the duty of the countries that have improperly profited from African labour is to return to Africa a share of what has been taken over the past centuries”.@@@It is true that Africa has always been heavily plundered, but it remains rich in people, assets and mineral wealth.@@@By way of proof, in terms of its mineral resources.@@@Africa has 30 per cent of the world’s mineral reserves.@@@40 per cent of gold reserves.@@@33 per cent of diamond reserves.@@@80 per cent of coltan reserves.@@@60 per cent of cobalt reserves.@@@55 per cent of uranium reserves, and so on.@@@Africa’s youth is standing up for itself now more than ever before in strong support of that Africa.@@@I ask Mr. Macron if he still needs a bit of history to remind him?@@@Lastly, long before that regrettable, and therefore unfortunate, exit by French President Emmanuel Macron, like so many of his fellow politicians, he had attacked African motherhood.@@@In that regard too.@@@I would like to remind him that Germany has a population of approximately 83 million over an area of 347.000 square km, as compared to the Congo, which has 95 million inhabitants on a surface area of 2.345.000 square km.@@@Secondly.@@@Belgium has 11 million inhabitants on a surface area of 30.000 square km, as compared to Gabon, which has 2.5 million inhabitants in an area of 267.000 square km.@@@Thirdly.@@@France has 68 million inhabitants on 672.329 square km, as compared to Namibia, which has 2.5 million inhabitants in an area of 825.000 square km.@@@In view of all that I just mentioned.@@@Aime Cesaire, peace be with him, said:
“Africa is the only continent in the world where the people sing, dance and applaud for those who impoverish, starve and torture them.@@@The misfortune of Africa is to have met France”.@@@While it is true that the West has raped, violated and robbed Africa, what is our share of the blame?@@@As African leaders, what is our share of responsibility?@@@Are not we, as African leaders, the ones who give in to being trampled underfoot?@@@Indeed, we have surrendered our identity to be nothing.@@@Our names have disappeared to make way for other imported names that do not fit our realities.@@@We need to reclaim our culture.@@@We have copied the West in monogamy, and now they want us to believe that contrary values and unnatural attitudes are a matter of freedom.@@@There will be no question of homosexuality in Africa.@@@I reiterate that there will be no question of homosexuality among us.@@@What has just been described are the deeply unfortunate labels of a United Nations that today can be summed up as follows, since there are 1.2 billion people plunged into poverty.@@@$2,000 billion spent on armaments and 20 times the United Nations budget spent on nuclear.@@@With regard to development.@@@Africa receives $34 billion from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, as compared to $160 billion for the West.@@@It is reduced to the paralysis of the Security Council, the paralysis of the World Trade Organization and the rise in tensions following geostrategic repositioning.@@@The World Trade Organization is also still blocked.@@@The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank operate like true usurers.@@@The World Health Organization is increasingly dominated by profitable pharmaceutical firms, giving commercial, rather than social, priority to vaccines, such as the coronavirus disease vaccine.@@@The United Nations is increasingly becoming a shadow of its former self as a result of attempts to hijack it by a group of imperialist international Powers, thereby blurring the clarity and seriousness of its decision-making, and so on.@@@Consequently, the peoples of Africa in general, and those of the Sahel in particular, will resolutely fight to ensure that ECOWAS, the African Union and the United Nations are institutions genuinely at the service of the peoples of the world for their complete emancipation and genuine social progress.@@@Because it is the shortcomings of those organizations, their lack of sincerity, their cronyism and arbitrary decisions, the cover-up of constitutional tampering with its attendant crimes, the promotion of poor governance, looting, social disorder and corruption that inevitably lead to coups d’etat, which are hence simply consequences.@@@Let us therefore 
deal with the root causes, and the consequences will disappear of their own accord.@@@However, if we continue with that ostrich game of hypocritical diplomacy to shameless State lies, organized crime, constitutional tampering and the creation of lackeys at the head of our African States, even the United Nations may not escape a coup d’etat.@@@Do not say that it was not warned.@@@In that regard, in order to take their destiny into their own hands.@@@Mali, the Niger and Burkina Faso signed the Alliance of Sahel States (ASS).@@@The ASS is a framework for securing our countries, based on the revised treaty on the Authority for the Integrated Development of the Liptako-Gourma Region.@@@Taking into account the security situation and, above all, the lack of openness in partnerships, we need to rely on our own means by seeking to pool our resources and working to eradicate gaps in operational areas.@@@In a loud and firm voice.@@@I plainly and forcefully say the following.@@@First, we African peoples are essentially democratic.@@@As proof, our commitment to human dignity transcends democracy.@@@What we reject is therefore not so much democracy as the trap of democracy that is set for us.@@@Electoral democracy has thus proved to be a means of controlling our States through the game of musical chairs played by leaders who are often imposters, the corrupt, thieves and Constitution violators, because they have no regard for the only true interest of our African States.@@@Secondly, are we Africans recognized today for our dignity as humans in the sense that one person is equal to another?@@@The answer is definitely, over and above the particular convenience of putting us to sleep and better enslaving us.@@@It is a sad day for the dark continent, scientifically recognized as the cradle of humankind, but in reality humiliated and placed under control and domination.@@@From bogus independence to fratricidal wars, from electoral democracy to biased aid, from wars of plunder to terrorism, maliciously fabricated, maintained and fed into our African countries, in particular Mali.@@@Burkina Faso and the Niger, a single conclusion can be drawn — that it is to dominate us and keep the foot on our neck, as in the case of our unfortunate brother.@@@George Floyd, right here in the United States.@@@Is that democracy?@@@There are supporters of that narrow view of freedom who intellectually justify the enslavement of, and barbarism against, our peoples in the struggle for their dignity and sovereignty in the name of a paradoxical principle of freedom that ultimately kills freedom.@@@Oh freedom, what crimes have been committed in your name.@@@That is why we have now decided to say no to all those friends who wish us well to the point of threatening us with war in order to impose their friendship.@@@We will adapt that democracy, so brandished and vaunted by wolves in sheep’s clothing, in order to develop the right political leadership for our peoples on our own with a view to their happiness.@@@Yes, complete emancipation and genuine social progress for our peoples are the ultimate goal of any action, be it political, economic, sociocultural or security-related.@@@Thirdly, the African peoples in general and those of the Sahel in particular have discovered the shackles of economic, security and sociocultural enslavement, embodied in secret agreements with France, and are committed to breaking them for their true emancipation.@@@Such shackles include, first, colonial debt, to which we are not going to close our eyes and pay while leaving our people to die of hunger, thirst and even disease.@@@Secondly, there is the issue of currency, specifically the franc of the French African colonies, the CFA franc, which is not African property.@@@In legal terms, property means the right to enjoy and dispose of things in the most absolute manner — see article 544 of the French Civil Code on the issue.@@@France therefore holds a patent on the CFA franc.@@@As a result, it owns the CFA franc and lends it out to the French-speaking African States.@@@Moreover, the funny thing is that the banknotes issued by France for West Africa differ from those for Central Africa in monetary value under the same name of the CFA franc.@@@The only document recognizing the CFA franc is Decree No. 45-0136 of 25 December 1945, signed by Charles de Gaulle.@@@President of the Provisional Government of the French Republic.@@@Rene Pleven.@@@Minister for Finance, and Jacques Soustelle.@@@Minister of the Colonies.@@@Thirdly, the priority given to French interests and companies in public contracts and calls for tender is over.@@@Fourthly, the exclusive right to supply military equipment and to train military officers in the colonies is also over, and so on.@@@Fourthly, no one welcomes a coup d’etat, but, if we ignore the fact that such coups d’etat are often the consequence of poor governance and constitutional tampering in order to gain additional mandates, there will always be coups d’etat.@@@Let us therefore have the clear-sightedness to fight the real causes by continuing to demand respect for democratic rules and good governance.@@@Fifthly, the people of Africa are not against the French people.@@@Rather, they are against French policies, which are full of condescension.@@@By refusing to recall its ambassador to the Niger.@@@France is violating international law, in particular article 9, paragraphs 1 and 2, of the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.@@@The decision to ban performers from Burkina Faso.@@@Mali and the Niger in France shows a very serious misunderstanding of the importance of culture as a driving force for family, community and even national stability.@@@Performers are physicians of the mind, even at a distance.@@@As they have declared that they do not want unemployed people, migrants, thieves, et cetera, in France, we in Africa in general and in the Sahel in particular do not want the manufacturers of the unemployed and thieves through the cynical plundering of our resources.@@@I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the peoples of the world and to all figures at all levels in the world who understand and support Burkina Faso.@@@Mali and the Niger in the difficult, but worthy ascent on the road to full emancipation — the affirmation of dignity, honour, freedom, equality, prosperity, justice and therefore peace.@@@In response to the current situation in Burkina Faso, the Government has taken resolute action by adopting a new development plan, the action plan for stabilization and development, and its four priorities: first, the fight against terrorism and restoring territorial integrity; secondly, response to the humanitarian crisis; thirdly.@@@State-rebuilding and improving governance; and, lastly, national reconciliation and social cohesion.@@@Such efforts seek to provide the Burkinabe people with better living conditions.@@@While we salute all our partners around the world who work with us, we strongly advise those who are still in doubt or are stunned by false reports that they are welcome in Burkina Faso, provided that the partnership is in line with the transition vision summarized in those four pillars.@@@Long live the United Nations.@@@Long live the seventy-eighth session of the General Assembly.@@@Long live peoples in struggle.@@@Long live solidarity among peoples.@@@Long live a free Africa.@@@Long live the Alliance of Sahel States.@@@Long live Burkina Faso.@@@Homeland or death, we shall overcome.@@@It is my pleasure on this occasion to offer my greetings and appreciation to all the Heads of State and delegations that are participating in the seventy-eighth session of the General Assembly.@@@I would also like to congratulate Mr. Dennis Francis on presiding over the General Assembly at this session, and I wish him every success in that noble task.@@@I also want to thank Mr. Csaba Korosi.@@@President of the General Assembly at its previous session, for his efforts.@@@I sincerely thank and appreciate Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and reiterate Algeria’s support for his tireless and commendable efforts to strengthen the role of our Organization and to promote it in order to respond to the aspirations of our peoples.@@@We are here in this global Hall, which embraces the entire world in all its differences and diversity, hoping to promote the urgent matter of dialogue and discussion leading to coexistence, cooperation, solidarity and equality among nations.@@@For over 50 years, my 
country has highlighted from this noble rostrum the dysfunction of the current global order and called for a new international order to achieve the equality among States for which the United Nations was established.@@@The conflicts and crises in our world have reached unprecedented levels.@@@Millions of people have been displaced and international relations transformed from ties of cooperation and consensus to confrontation and conflict that threaten international organizations in the midst of a world that is enduring climate and other emergencies under extreme pressure.@@@In the face of those geopolitical conflicts and multiple crises, the weakening of the pivotal role of the Security Council over the past few years is evident.@@@The Council’s role, as set out in the Charter of the United Nations, is to maintain international peace and security, in particular by preventing the use of force and by eliminating the causes that threaten peace and the peaceful resolution of conflicts.@@@The time has come for all of us to reflect together on how to uphold the principles and values of the Charter, to promote our common resolve and to build a strong foundation leading to more effective global cooperation on major issues in order to establish international peace and security and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals in a multipolar world.@@@From that perspective.@@@Algeria will soon be a non-permanent member of the Security Council.@@@We are aware of the responsibility that is incumbent on us, especially in the face of the many challenges that the international community is facing.@@@We take this opportunity to once again thank the 184 Member States that voted in favour of my country.@@@That was an expression of trust that Algeria will seek to uphold throughout its term on the Council.@@@We are ready to strengthen cooperation with all States members of the Security Council and the United Nations as a whole.@@@We are also ready to use Algeria’s extensive experience in mediation and to prioritize political solutions and peaceful settlements of conflicts.@@@In that spirit, my country will join the Security Council, bringing with it the aspirations of the peoples of the African continent and the Arab world, and calling for an end to managing conflicts and focusing on achieving lasting solutions to conflicts by addressing their root causes.@@@Any effort to strengthen joint international action requires us to respond to the growing appeals to strengthen the multilateral system by comprehensively reforming the main organs of our Organization in order to make them more transparent and ensure the necessary balance among the main organs and equitable geographical distribution.@@@The revitalized central role of the General Assembly, the only organ that truly reflects the diversity of our international community, is a key element in strengthening equality among States and the pillars of true democracy.@@@It is also essential to making progress on intergovernmental negotiations on reforming the Security Council, based on an integrated and comprehensive approach.@@@That should be a priority for the international community if it is to reach consensus on genuine reform that ensures greater representation and transparency.@@@I reiterate the commitment of Algeria to the Common African Position, which would put an end to the historic injustice against the African continent.@@@Algeria knows well the price of freedom.@@@We will never abandon just causes and always support oppressed peoples fighting for their freedom.@@@That is why we have always supported the Palestinian question in order to enable the brotherly Palestinian people to exercise their inalienable rights and to establish their own independent State within the 4 June 1967 borders, with Jerusalem as its capital, in conformity with the resolutions of international legitimacy.@@@As part of our support for the just Palestinian question, and under my own personal supervision, late last year my country held a meeting attended by various Palestinian factions that was crowned with the adoption of the Algiers Declaration.@@@In that context.@@@I reiterate our commitment to the Arab Peace Initiative as a framework for resolving the Palestinian question and putting an end to the occupation, which is the main cause of instability in the Middle East region.@@@I appeal to the conscience of the international community to assume its moral and historical responsibility and allow the Palestinian people to regain their full rights and decide on their own future.@@@Furthermore.@@@I take this opportunity to call on the International Court of Justice to respond to the request made by the General Assembly on 30 December 2022 by giving an advisory opinion regarding the Israeli practices affecting human rights in the occupied Palestinian territories, including East Jerusalem.@@@We aspire to establishing the truth and honouring the struggle of the Palestinian people, who have suffered and sacrificed too long under occupation.@@@From this rostrum.@@@I also call on the Security Council to adopt a resolution that would guarantee the two-State solution. 
which enjoys consensus within the international community, and put an end to the unilateral practices of the occupying authority, foremost of which are the settlement activities on occupied Palestinian territories.@@@We once again call for and insist on the need for a special session of the General Assembly to grant the State of Palestine the status of full-fledged membership.@@@I repeat, we call once again for a special session of the General Assembly to grant the State of Palestine the status of full-fledged membership.@@@We are proud of what our Organization has accomplished in terms of decolonization in a number of regions, and we aspire to a definitive end to the colonization of the last African colony.@@@Indeed, an entire people in Western Sahara have been deprived of its fundamental right to self-determination.@@@It is necessary to organize a free and fair referendum consistent with the African settlement plan that was adopted by the Security Council in 1991 and approved by both parties but still awaits implementation.@@@Given that reality and attempts to create legitimacy based on illegitimacy, it is incumbent on the United Nations to preserve the credibility of its own resolutions, to support the full implementation of those resolutions and to safeguard its reputation.@@@In that context.@@@I reiterate our support for the efforts of the Secretary-General and his Personal Envoy for Western Sahara to relaunch direct negotiations and to organize a referendum to allow the Sahrawi people to exercise their right to self-determination, in accordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions.@@@My country is following with great interest the troubling events in some sisterly and friendly nations.@@@We are making every effort to find peaceful solutions and to bring the parties together in order to bring positions and points of view closer.@@@Turning now to the situation in sisterly Libya.@@@I reiterate our support for the United Nations efforts to find a political solution led by the Libyan people themselves and allowing them to preserve the unity, sovereignty territorial integrity of Libya.@@@Turning to the situation in Mali.@@@Algeria is playing a lead role in the area of international mediation and presiding over the Follow-up Committee on the Agreement on Peace and Reconciliation in Mali emanating from the Algiers process.@@@It is resolute in its efforts to overcome the obstacles in that sisterly nation.@@@We reiterate our position rejecting any resort to force in order to settle conflicts.@@@With regard to developments in our neighbouring country the Niger.@@@Algeria reiterates its commitment to a return to the constitutional order through peaceful means and to ensuring that diplomatic and political solutions prevail, while respecting the rule of law.@@@We call for vigilance, given the intentions of foreign military intervention, which could have dangerous repercussions on peace and stability in the Niger and in the region as a whole.@@@At the same time, the concerning situation in the Sudan requires us to call on all sisterly parties to the conflict to put an end to the fighting and to pursue dialogue.@@@That situation has serious repercussions on the humanitarian situation in the country.@@@That vulnerable and unstable situation is casting a shadow over the entire Sahel and Sahara region, which suffers from low development rates, famine and climate change, leading to further instability and strengthening terrorist groups that use the region as a haven for their criminal activity.@@@In that context.@@@Algeria is sparing no effort to support the development of countries of the region, and has been sharing its experience in the area of combating terrorism and violent extremism.@@@In that regard, we participated in the extraordinary summit of the African Union held in Malabo on 28 May 2022 as coordinator of the fight against terrorism and violent extremism in Africa.@@@We presented a report at that time about the threat caused by the growth of terrorism in Africa and mechanisms to address it.@@@The report also considered a number of practical mechanisms to strengthen the fight against terrorism in Africa, and underscored the importance of making the fight against terrorism a top priority that requires common African action.@@@Moreover.@@@Algeria’s contribution as an international mediator is not confined to its geographical region.@@@My country also truly participated in the Arab Contact Group’s efforts to relaunch direct negotiations between Russia and Ukraine.@@@More than eight years after the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Addis Ababa Plan of Action, many developing States continue to face challenges and need more solidarity from the international community in order to achieve a better world and to have a more equitable and effective economic model that would allow them to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@Algeria has adopted a sustainable development plan that it has made a national priority and integrated into all of the plans, strategies and programmes that have been launched by the Government.@@@That in turn has made it possible for us to achieve considerable results in the area of the Sustainable Development Goals, especially with regard to education, health care, construction, electricity and water.@@@Speaking of water, my country has launched a desalination of sea waters programme, and by the end of 2024 will be able to produce over a billion metric tons of water daily.@@@My country has always enjoyed the support and confidence of the Human Rights Council and is party to most international human rights treaties.@@@We strengthen our cooperation with the Human Rights Council, coordinate with various human rights bodies and deal with the Universal Periodic Review (UPR).@@@In the context of the UPR, my country issued its fourth national report in November 2022.@@@My country is firmly convinced that respect for and the promotion of human rights are the very cornerstones of any credible political system.@@@That is why we work to strengthen human rights by all means available to us.@@@That resolve is based on the Algerian people’s attachment to human rights.@@@My country’s Constitution was amended in 2020 on the basis of that conviction and our belief in the need to strengthening fundamental freedoms and human rights.@@@The amendment explicitly bans any undermining of those freedoms; enshrines equality among all citizens, men and women, in terms of rights and duties; and strengthens the effective participation of all, especially in the promotion of women’s rights, the empowerment of women economically and politically, and women’s participation in positions of responsibility.@@@We are also seeking to guarantee the principle of equality in the labour market, to strengthen the role played by women in the area of peace and security, and to enhance the status of women in all walks of life, be it at the national, continental or international levels.@@@A practical national plan in the context of implementing Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) has been implemented.@@@Algeria is committed to strengthening the role of women in the prevention of and resolution of conflicts, in keeping with the principles of our foreign policy.@@@Algeria has many young people, accounting for more than 70 per cent of our population.@@@We have therefore adopted measures to provide institutional management with the means necessary to build capacity for young people and to make them a driving force of the process of sustainable development and in the economic, political and cultural arenas.@@@In conclusion, we aspire to a world where peace and prosperity will reign for all human beings under the aegis of the United Nations.@@@We must show sincere determination and strong commitment to meeting the legitimate aspirations of our peoples.@@@We have gathered in New York once again.@@@The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are at their midpoint, facing mounting obstacles.@@@To our dismay, the aggression against Ukraine has yet to cease.@@@This year, as the world stands at a historical inflection point.@@@Japan is serving as a non-permanent member of the Security Council and the presidency of the Group of Seven (G-7).@@@In those capacities.@@@I have heard the desperate calls for peace and the pleas of vulnerable people seeking help.@@@We should respond to these voices and work towards a world filled with cooperation, not division and confrontation.@@@That is my message to all the leaders of the Member States.@@@In his report Our Common Agenda (A/75/982).@@@Secretary-General Guterres called for international solidarity.@@@Let us renew our commitment to a strong and effective multilateralism, with the United Nations at its core.@@@The world is facing complex and interrelated issues, ranging from climate change and infectious diseases to challenges to the rule of law.@@@Now, at a time when international cooperation is needed more than ever, we cannot overcome those difficulties if the international community remains divided over ideologies or values.@@@That is why I believe we should go back to the very basic foundation of treating human life and dignity with paramount importance.@@@We should aim for a world caring for human dignity, where vulnerable people can live safely and securely.@@@At a time when the international community is facing multiple crises and increasingly being divided, we need a common language that resonates with all of us.@@@By shedding new light on human dignity.@@@I believe that the international community can overcome differences in regimes or values and steadily advance human-centred international cooperation.@@@Japan has led human-centred international cooperation based on the concept of human security.@@@With that approach, we need to accelerate efforts among the international community to achieve the SDGs.@@@The dignity of the individual must not be neglected as States and the international community tackle global challenges.@@@To overcome inequalities and achieve the SDGs, quality growth and sustainable growth are essential.@@@The key is to invest in people, which is my political credo.@@@The gender perspective is also important for quality growth.@@@Japan aims to reduce inequalities and overcome social divisions by promoting women's participation.@@@Japan will promote transparent and fair development finance in accordance with international rules to achieve sustainable growth in developing countries.@@@Private finance will also be tapped to fill the gap of development finance.@@@Japan will work with other countries to find ways to manage economies that protect human dignity while attracting investment dynamism.@@@In order to address unprecedented crises and challenges and to protect and strengthen human dignity, let us start step by step where we can.@@@The first step is cooperation towards the realization of a peaceful and stable international community where human dignity is respected.@@@Hailing from Hiroshima, which was devastated by atomic bombing.@@@I have made nuclear disarmament my lifelong mission.@@@With a view to achieving a world without nuclear weapons, we will continue to bolster realistic and practical efforts, while upholding and strengthening the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons by implementing measures under the Hiroshima Action Plan.@@@I call on the political leaders of nuclear-weapon States and other countries around the globe to step up their engagement on nuclear disarmament so that people from all walks of life are exposed to its importance and take concrete action, not despite of but because of the challenging security environment.@@@With a view to working towards a world without nuclear weapons, which we have been striving for together with the hibakusha — the surviving victims of atomic bombings — we must crystalize the nuclear disarmament trend, which has been successfully mainstreamed thanks to the efforts of our predecessors.@@@As we speak, we are faced with the threat of the reversal of the downward trend of the global number of nuclear weapons.@@@The significance of a treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other explosive devices (FMCT), which was avowed here in the General Assembly 30 years ago, has not diminished by any measure.@@@That is why I recently co-hosted a high- level event on FMCT, with the Philippines and Australia, to refocus political attention towards the FMCT on the thirtieth year of its initial proposal.@@@Having nuclear- weapon States engage in concrete nuclear disarmament measures is key.@@@Japan, as a non-permanent member of the Security Council, will work with the United Nations and relevant States to promote dialogue between nuclear- weapon States and non-nuclear-weapon States.@@@To set in stone the trend of mainstreaming nuclear disarmament, it is paramount to transcend purely governmental efforts and to engage in multilayered efforts.@@@To overcome the divisive debate among academia and Government over whether we should be choosing deterrence or disarmament.@@@Japan will contribute ¥3 billion to establish a Japan chair for a world without nuclear weapons at overseas research institutes and think tanks.@@@We will also continue to build a global network of young people for nuclear abolition, making use of the Youth Leader Fund for a World Without Nuclear Weapons, which I established last year in cooperation with the United Nations.@@@It is also essential to ensure nuclear safety and the security of nuclear materials and facilities, including in situations of conflict.@@@We also need to defend the dignity of people threatened by armed conflicts.@@@Russia’s aggression against Ukraine continues.@@@A food crisis must not be perpetuated.@@@Supporting vulnerable people in Africa, the Middle East and elsewhere is essential.@@@We need to protect the safety of women and children, who are the most vulnerable in conflict situations, strengthen border controls and measures against trafficking in persons, and provide international support to retrieve abducted children.@@@The women and peace and security agenda identifies women as crucial and active players in relevant policies for peace and security, and Japan will continue to promote that agenda.@@@The second issue is how to strike a balance between the progress of digitalization and human dignity.@@@Digitalization is bringing benefits to all; however, there are risks of privacy and human rights violations.@@@We need a digital ecosystem and international rules that are compatible with human dignity.@@@That is why, at the G-7 Hiroshima Summit, we launched the Hiroshima Artificial Intelligence (Al) Process on generative Al, towards attaining trustworthy Al.@@@Japan will also strengthen its support for digitalization in developing countries while ensuring cybersecurity.
Thirdly.@@@Japan will work to mitigate the potential impact on people that may arise before net zero is achieved.@@@Asian countries are the key to globally achieving net zero.@@@Under the Asia Zero Emission Community initiative.@@@Japan will promote effective cooperation, taking into account various needs.@@@Japan will further support disaster risk reduction for countries vulnerable to climate change, including island States, aiding efforts towards resilient economies and societies against sea level rise and natural disasters associated with extreme weather events.@@@The ocean is a new frontier with abundant potential, and it is essential to take comprehensive measures, including making use of blue carbon to tackle climate change.@@@The perspective of international law is also important.@@@Japan supports the preservation of existing baselines under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, even after the future regression of coastlines due to sea level rise.@@@As the G-7 presidency, we have set a framework for cooperation on biodiversity conservation and a target of reducing additional plastic pollution to zero by 2040.@@@Japan will continue to contribute in the field of environmental protection.@@@Fourthly, we must prepare for the next infectious disease outbreak.@@@We must be ready for the next infectious disease, learning from the lessons learned in our fight against the coronavirus disease.@@@At the G-7, both the public and private sectors have pledged more than $48 billion to achieve universal health coverage and to strengthen prevention, preparedness and response to health crises.@@@Japan will contribute $7.5 billion for the period 2022- 2025.@@@Together with the mobilization of domestic financial resources.@@@Japan supports mobilizing financial resources in the private sector through the promotion of impact investments.@@@Japan will continue to work with developing countries, including emerging economies, to ensure equitable access to medical countermeasures for health emergencies, based on the Group of 20 outcomes.@@@At a time when the world is at an historical inflection point, we must reflect on how we started here.@@@Inscribed in the Charter of the United Nations is the firm determination of our predecessors, following the experience of two world wars, to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war and to protect human dignity.@@@The principles of the United Nations Charter, such as sovereign equality, respect for territorial integrity and the prohibition of the use of force, are fundamental principles of international law allowing people to live in peace and provide the basis of the rule of law.@@@International law exists for the benefit of weaker States.@@@Together, under the rule of law.@@@Japan would like to protect the right of vulnerable nations and peoples to live in peace in order to safeguard and strengthen human dignity.@@@However, to this day.@@@Russia, a permanent member of the Security Council, is infringing upon international law and the rule of law.@@@Unilateral changes to the status quo by force or coercion are unacceptable anywhere in the world.@@@The situation, which the General Assembly has repeatedly condemned as a violation of the United Nations Charter and human rights, must be rectified as soon as possible and the nuclear threat must be ended.@@@In March.@@@I announced a new plan for a free and open Indo-Pacific.@@@Based on the principles of freedom, the rule of law, inclusiveness, openness and diversity.@@@Japan will work with countries that share a vision of a world where diverse nations coexist and prosper together.@@@Japan will further extend our support for peacekeepers.@@@Japan will strengthen the scope and quality of the United Nations Triangular Partnership Programme, with an additional contribution of approximately $9 million to support the capacity-building of personnel deployed in African Union peace support operations.@@@Japan’s policy on North Korea remains unchanged.@@@Japan seeks to normalize its relationship with North Korea, in accordance with the Japan-Democratic People’s Republic of Korea Pyongyang Declaration, by comprehensively resolving outstanding issues of concern, such as the abductions, nuclear and missile issues, and the settlement of our unfortunate past.@@@From the perspective of opening up a new era together.@@@I would like to convey my determination to meet with President Kim Jong Un face to face, at any time and without any conditions, and to hold high-level talks under my direct supervision to realize a summit meeting at an early date.@@@The United Nations should be a place of listening to the voices of people facing difficulties, empowering them and overcoming such difficulties through cooperation.@@@It should not be a place of confrontation and division.@@@This year, we have agreed on concrete measures to strengthen the structures that support the President of the General Assembly.@@@That is a firm step towards a United Nations for cooperation.@@@We commend the Secretary-General’s leadership with his vision for multilateralism.@@@Initiatives to limit the use of the veto, which exacerbates divisions and confrontation in the United Nations, will strengthen and restore confidence in the Security Council.@@@Japan will also pursue its efforts to increase the transparency of discussions in the Security Council, including by improving access to deliberations in the Security Council for Member States other than the permanent members.@@@To that end.@@@Japan will contribute to the clarification of the rules of the Security Council.@@@The world is changing dramatically.@@@We need a Security Council that reflects the world today.@@@Japan supports increased representation of Africa and the need to expand both the permanent and the non-permanent membership of the Council.@@@Looking ahead to next year’s@@@Summit of the Future and the subsequent eightieth anniversary of the United Nations, now is the opportunity to move to concrete action.@@@International cooperation that protects and strengthens human dignity will be the driving force that brings the world back towards the same goal.@@@I am looking forward to deepening this discussion at next year’s Summit of the Future with future generations in mind.@@@As we envision the post-2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development world.@@@I believe that human dignity should be the core principle that illuminates the future of the international community.@@@Let us join our forces to strengthen human dignity and create a United Nations for cooperation.@@@Today humankind faces enormous shifts unseen in a century and has entered yet another period of geopolitical confrontation.@@@The essence of the threat comes from the simultaneous erosion of fundamental principles of international law embodied in the Charter of the United Nations.@@@The displacement of those pillars puts an increasingly heavy burden on the existing structure of international relations and creates confrontations.@@@The pattern of non-compliance, suspension and withdrawal from key international legal instruments is extremely concerning, as it could lead to the point of no return.@@@This situation disrupts the trading system, weakens the supply chains that drive economic life, damages food security and accelerates inflation.@@@Current negative trends further exacerbate human suffering.@@@Some 108 million people have been forcibly displaced, more than 1 billion live in poverty, and 2 billion do not have access to essential medicines.@@@The ultimate result is humankind’s loss of confidence in the future stable development of the world.@@@The younger generations no longer believe that the world they inherit will be a better one.@@@Therefore.@@@Kazakhstan finds it necessary to restate its unwavering commitment to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.@@@The leaders gathered here are responsible for the fate and future of humankind, yet as we approach the United Nations eightieth anniversary, we have come almost full circle back to the Organization’s point of departure.@@@The resolution of political issues by force in fact results only in deadlock.@@@Dialogue is the only way to create a conducive environment that enables agreement on new principles and norms.@@@Despite our best efforts, conflicts persist in many regions of the world.@@@We urge all parties to seek diplomatic solutions to conflicts based on the United Nations Charter and universally recognized international law.@@@In that regard.@@@Kazakhstan commends all the efforts and plans proposed by different States and groups of countries in support of a political settlement of the Ukrainian crisis.@@@Diplomacy and dialogue should always prevail in seeking the resolution of international disputes.@@@We must therefore together make the greatest efforts to stabilize the only system of global institutions we have.@@@We will not succeed in tackling those challenges without a comprehensive reform of the Security Council.@@@That is an urgent need of our time that meets the interests of the vast majority of humankind.@@@I am strongly convinced that the voices of the middle Powers and all developing countries on the Council need to be amplified and clearly heard.@@@Since the Security Council appears unable to move beyond deadlock, it should become more representative so that other countries — including Kazakhstan — can play a greater role in the maintenance of peace and security.@@@In our own region, the growing engagement of Member States has been a positive force in the transformation of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building Measures in Asia into a full- fledged international organization that can contribute to continental mediation and peacemaking.@@@Similarly, as the current Chair of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.@@@Kazakhstan has put forward the initiative of World Unity for a Just Peace and Harmony.@@@The initiative, which we invite Members to join, comprises a new security paradigm, a fair economic environment and a clean planet.@@@Open dialogue between the global South and the global North is its central pillar.@@@Of all the challenges we face, perhaps the most destructive is the threat of use of nuclear weapons.@@@Thirty years ago.@@@Kazakhstan voluntarily renounced the fourth-largest inherited nuclear arsenal.@@@That is why the logic of the nuclear agenda must be reversed.@@@Only mutual trust and cooperation among nuclear Powers on the path to a world free of nuclear weapons can produce global stability.@@@In that context.@@@Kazakhstan declares its continuous commitment to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.@@@We support the development of new mechanisms in the field of disarmament and non-proliferation.@@@A strategic plan for the complete renunciation of nuclear weapons by 2045 could well be the most significant contribution to global security of this generation of leaders.@@@At the same time, the coronavirus disease has painfully illustrated our vulnerability to future biological risks and threats.@@@Kazakhstan appeals to the Secretary-General and the President of the Assembly to launch the process of establishing an international agency for biological safety.@@@We welcome the Secretary-General’s New Agenda for Peace.@@@That strategic document must confront the trust vacuum and growing hostility in the world.@@@At the upcoming Summit of the Future next year.@@@Kazakhstan will play a constructive and supportive role in adopting a pact for the future.@@@But the search for peace is not just about the banning of weapons or the signing of declarations.@@@Interreligious and interfaith dialogue plays a key role in fostering a culture of peace.@@@We are therefore concerned about recent acts of profound disrespect towards holy books.@@@Such barbaric acts against Islam or any other religions cannot be accepted as expressions of freedom, free speech and democracy.@@@All holy books, including the Holy Quran, deserve legal protection against vandalism.@@@Finally, a culture of peace can be based only on the principles of unity in diversity and mutual respect.@@@I am proud therefore of the outstanding role of the Astana-based Congress of Leaders of World and Traditional Religions.@@@In brief.@@@Kazakhstan is a peace-loving nation that pursues its own national interest while continuously searching for peaceful solutions to pending international issues.@@@Independence, territorial integrity and sovereignty are core principles that will guide my people now and in the future.@@@We will continue cooperation with our major allies on all strategic issues.@@@We need new assessments that will enable us to tackle pressing global economic problems while ensuring the right to development.@@@To do so, we require an open, transparent and inclusive multilateral trading system based on the principles and rules of the World Trade Organization.@@@We also need to think about a better global food security system.@@@Nearly 10 per cent of the world’s population faced hunger last year.@@@We must 
boost voluntary information exchange on food security, including volumes of production, and the export and import of food products.@@@In concert, we must enable the transparent tracking of funding from the international community in response to food crises.@@@Kazakhstan is ready to act as a regional food supply hub.@@@We have all the required resources, infrastructure and logistics in place for those purposes.@@@Kazakhstan is already a reliable link for nearly 80 per cent of overland transit traffic between Asia and Europe.@@@The Trans-Caspian International Transport Route — the so- called Middle Corridor — can significantly strengthen East-West engagement.@@@The route could increase the pace of trade between critical markets, cutting by almost half the amount of time required to transport goods via the maritime route.@@@The urgency of climate action risks become a cliche, but it is a dangerous cliche because immediate, effective and transformational steps are urgently required to prioritize environmental protection.@@@Central Asia is one of its front lines.@@@Even if we successfully limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C by 2030 — which is looking increasingly unlikely — we will experience between 2°C and 2.5°C of temperature rise in Central Asia.@@@Despite the long road of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, we must all remain committed to a carbon-free future.@@@The climate agenda should not be used to introduce measures restricting trade and investment cooperation.@@@Instead we must focus on positive change, such as the climate-positive actions identified by the United Nations, including investing in green jobs, ending fossil fuel subsidies, and ensuring that all climate actions are fair and inclusive and involve women at all levels.@@@Yet without proper funding, ambitious plans to combat climate change will remain unmet.@@@In that regard, we propose to launch a just energy transition partnership in Kazakhstan.@@@A gradual, sustainable and socially responsible transition away from coal would be a big bonus for global climate change goals.@@@Kazakhstan’s initiative to open a project office for Central Asia on climate change and green energy in Almaty can lead on those issues.@@@We look forward to hosting a regional climate summit in Kazakhstan in 2026 under United Nations auspices.@@@In our region, we have seen how water scarcity has created serious economic and other challenges in transboundary river basins.@@@That will be replicated across the world — by 2040, global demand for water may outstrip supply by as much as 40 per cent.@@@We must therefore combine political will and economic resources to address that critical global issue, simultaneously with climate action.@@@Next year we will assume the chairmanship of the International Fund for Saving the Aral Sea.@@@We will continue our efforts to prevent the further degradation of the environment and its impact on livelihoods around what was once the fourth largest lake on the planet.@@@Today it is the world’s largest lake — the Caspian Sea — that also faces ecological challenges, including shallowing, water diversion and the pollution of flora and fauna.@@@Saving the Caspian Sea must be a matter of common priority that requires long-term international cooperation.@@@Kazakhstan is committed to further enhancing multifaceted cooperation with the countries of Central Asia.@@@Our region can play a more active role as a cohesive and independent part of the international community, while contributing to global development processes.@@@Fortunately, economic activity is growing.@@@Over the past five years, intraregional trade has doubled to $10 billion.@@@Our regional agenda includes Afghanistan, which must become a stable and prosperous State and a reliable trade partner.@@@In that context, the time is right to establish a United Nations regional centre for the Sustainable Development Goals for Central Asia and Afghanistan in Almaty.@@@I call on all Member States to support our initiative.@@@Let me also present a brief update on our domestic reform efforts.@@@Despite global, regional and geopolitical challenges, our society and Government are building a just and fair Kazakhstan.@@@In a very short period of time, we have reformed our institutions, amended our Constitution, curtailed the powers of the presidency, reset political and economic systems and battled corruption.@@@Much has been done in only two years.@@@The mindset of our people, particularly of the younger generation, has already changed substantially in that time.@@@The presidential mandate has been limited to one seven-year term.@@@That proposal was supported by the people of Kazakhstan in a public referendum and will remain unchanged in the future.@@@We will firmly adhere to the formula of “a strong President, an influential Parliament and an accountable Government”.@@@Those reforms are based on principles of justice, equality. 
fairness, and freedom.@@@It is my personal credo that the rule of law must prevail in all circumstances.@@@We understand that only political reform and investments in human capital can make our economy more resilient and robust.@@@Kazakhstan has made significant progress in achieving gender equality and empowering women and girls.@@@We have introduced a 30 per cent quota for women, youth and persons with disabilities in the electoral party lists.@@@It will allow them to participate more actively and equally in the political life of the country.@@@In my recent State of the Nation address.@@@I presented a new economic policy that is designed first of all to provide all citizens the opportunities necessary for decent life.@@@We are giving greater attention and value to young people who work hard and, with the support of the Government, will contribute to the sustainable development of the country and its leading position in international forums.@@@The health, well-being and good education of the younger generation are key priorities of Kazakhstan’s State policy.@@@I place my hope in the younger generation.@@@They will drive our country into future.@@@At home and abroad, we are working for that better future.@@@Let us rekindle the spirit of unity and collective action that underpins the United Nations.@@@Let us remember that our shared commitment to a better world transcends our differences.@@@Kazakhstan stands ready to collaborate with all Member States in the pursuit of a brighter, more just, and sustainable world.@@@We first give thanks to God the Almighty for having guided our steps and allowed us to find ourselves in this beautiful cosmopolitan city of New York.@@@Allow me to offer my sincere thanks to the host country, the United States of America, and its people, in particular the authorities and the people of the state of New York, for the very warm welcome and the legendary hospitality extended to me and the delegation accompanying me.@@@I would like to reiterate my deepest condolences to the peoples of Morocco and Libya, who are today bereaved by natural disasters whose human and material damage is immeasurable.@@@May God comfort the hard-hit families.@@@Allow me to extend my warm congratulations to Mr. Dennis Francis on his outstanding election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session.@@@Burundi assures him of its full cooperation and sends him its best wishes for success in the exercise of his mandate.@@@I am also pleased to pay well-deserved tribute to Mr. Csaba Korosi, his predecessor, for his remarkable work during his mandate.@@@The time has come to rebuild a peaceful world favourable to progress.@@@We must cultivate trust, mutual understanding and solidarity.@@@That is why we welcome the theme that animates us today.@@@“Rebuilding trust and reviving global solidarity: Accelerating the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals towards peace, prosperity, progress and sustainability for all”.@@@While we gather every year in this Hall and in other equally important venues, the world continues to face serious existential threats, unfortunately becoming more and more unstable and vulnerable as a result.@@@While trust and solidarity are values that should characterize relations among our States, they are weakened because we have domesticated them and recreated them in our image and according to our interests.@@@We must free them so that they are shared values.@@@They must regain their original meaning, shatteringly lost first with colonization and the expansion of other selfish ideologies that seek to exploit less developed countries further for the benefit of rich countries.@@@In reality, colonization squandered its opportunity to create solidarity through the meeting of cultures and knowhow and through a mutually beneficial partnership instead of a partnership of dependence.@@@Trust and solidarity then lost their primary meaning under the effects of neocolonialism, characterized by multifaceted interference in the internal affairs of developing States, by unfair remuneration for raw materials and by the strong demands imposed by the Bretton Woods institutions.@@@From “development assistance”, as it was called a few years ago, to the “partnership for development” in use today, the terms proliferate but all seem to be imbued with bad faith.@@@Indeed, the terms proliferate to veil that hypocrisy, while the resources put to work in the hope of economic returns likely to ensure recovery are declining.@@@It is important today to transcend the needs and interests of States, which are often divergent and even difficult to reconcile.@@@International solidarity must ensure that all countries can interact with each other on an equal footing — the international solidarity that we want seeks not to homogenize but to be a bridge between differences and even divergences, connecting each other through mutually respectful and beneficial relationships.@@@Trust and solidarity should be the foundation on which international relations free from inequality and conflict flourish.@@@It is also to that end that we in Burundi are working, first at the national level, to cultivate and strengthen that ideal within our people.@@@Thus, after years of instability, the truth and reconciliation process begun in Burundi is now bearing remarkable fruit because Burundians are now driven by the same ideal in the pursuit of the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@That is why we call on friendly and partner countries to support the action of the Burundian Government, and we strongly encourage foreign investment.@@@However, the sad observation is that public development assistance, which should support the 
Government’s efforts in seeking the well-being of citizens, has gradually collapsed in favour of funding intended for non-State actors serving the unspoken geopolitical and economic interests of certain donor States.@@@International solidarity should obviously encourage developed countries to contribute concretely to the socioeconomic development efforts of the least developed countries.@@@The moral of the Kirundi saying “Ntawutungira mu boro” —which means “prosperity is lasting only if it is shared”— reminds us that investing in the prosperity of our neighbours truly guarantees the security and sustainability of our own progress.@@@That underlines the urgent need to rethink and strengthen the global partnership, which, in our opinion, requires debt relief, a substantial increase in resources devoted to the fight against poverty, the strengthening of South- South cooperation, the sharing of technologies and innovation, and the expansion of trade agreements.@@@Despite all those challenges.@@@Burundi remains determined and confident that the General Assembly will help restore confidence in my country and drive a renewal of international solidarity.@@@The Government and the people of Burundi have a real and firm determination to optimize the dividends of peace and reconciliation so dearly won.@@@To that end, our battle cry is the promotion of good governance and the fight against all forms of injustice.@@@Indeed, we have engaged in a tireless fight for the good management of public affairs and, thanks to that fierce struggle.@@@Burundi has made significant progress in terms of democracy, good governance and the improvement of the business climate, thus becoming a safe place for investment opportunities and various economic activities.@@@Moreover, considerable efforts are being made in the production sectors that create mass employment and bring growth.@@@In that context, my Government strives to particularly promote the agricultural sector, which employs a large part of the Burundian population.@@@That is why we made the decision to finance the agricultural sector through a national agricultural subsidy programme that subsidizes fertilizer, selected seeds and phytosanitary products.@@@Our action also focuses on the development of research in the agricultural sector, mechanization and the use of advanced technologies for agrifood processing and rural infrastructure.@@@To that end, a national pact for agriculture has been developed to establish two agropoles around four profitable sectors in the short term, as well as a special agricultural industrial zone.@@@We want to involve Burundian economic operators and foreign investors on that front.@@@In that context and to implement the plan, the appropriate regulations of the new Investment Code are today very attractive.@@@Given its climate, which is conducive to year-round agriculture, the abundance of labour and the exceptional fertility of its soil.@@@Burundi is the best destination for anyone wishing to invest in the agricultural sector.@@@In other sectors, my Government has just updated the Mining Code in order to create an environment favourable to investors in that sector, whose abundant mineral potential remains underexploited.@@@The ambition of my Government is to boost our economy by exploiting natural resources to make Burundi an emerging country by 2040 and a developed country by 2060.@@@To win our bet, we are placing young people and women, the real stakeholders actors in socioeconomic development, at the forefront through the promotion of entrepreneurship, innovation and the spirit of creativity.@@@Indeed, we are focusing above all on youth because there is no more effective weapon than youth in the fight against poverty and in the prevention of conflicts.@@@As African Union Champion for Youth.@@@Peace and Security.@@@I take this opportunity to advocate for the better inclusion and effective participation of young people in the development programmes of our respective States.@@@In that regard.@@@I welcomed the decision of the General Assembly to establish a United Nations Youth Office, and I congratulate Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who proposed that flagship idea in his report Our Common Agenda (A/75/982).@@@That is how intergenerational trust and solidarity can truly be sources of peace and security for sustainable development.@@@A supporter of non-discrimination against young people and women, the Burundian Government has chosen to take advantage of their many talents and broad knowledge and to promote their economic empowerment.@@@Thus, in a desire to accelerate the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, free education in Burundi since 2005 has enabled Burundian girls to exercise their right to quality education and thereby prepare for active participation in national life.@@@For two decades.@@@Burundi has improved gender relations in the political arena by setting the representation of women in the National Assembly and the Senate at at least 30 per cent.@@@That rate is today 
around 50 per cent in Parliament, the Government and positions of responsibility.@@@Eager to leave no one behind in its drive for socioeconomic development, the Government of Burundi is sparing no effort to promote the emancipation and empowerment of all specific groups of its population.@@@With that in mind, the Batwa community, long victims of discrimination, now benefits from a policy of positive discrimination in the education, health and housing systems.@@@Free health care for children and pregnant women has also contributed to improving the living conditions of women in general and Batwa families in particular.@@@I have taken my time in describing the situation in my country to demonstrate that Burundi is back on track and has earned its place in the concert of nations.@@@It is a country that has recently overcome a difficult moment in its history but that has all the assets to go very far in development.@@@In reality, while Burundi today may be a burden for development partners, tomorrow the situation could change if we manage to obtain substantial start-up capital to definitively exit the category of less developed countries.@@@We want a better world, but our world faces a multitude of conflicts that we must collectively oppose with unity and fraternity.@@@Countries in difficulty need all of us.@@@It is therefore in a spirit of solidarity that, within the East African Community that I chair, we have initiated a series of actions with a view to restoring peace and security in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.@@@Burundi also participates in peacekeeping and counter-terrorism operations in the Central African Republic and Somalia, which demonstrates the desire of the Burundian people to contribute to the advent of a better and more united world.@@@Thus, in reiterating my call for international solidarity for the pacification of eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.@@@Burundi reaffirms its unwavering support for the Luanda and Nairobi peace processes and the Peace.@@@Security and Cooperation Framework for the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Region, whose Regional Oversight Mechanism is chaired by Burundi.@@@On this subject, if we insist on restoring trust among States, we should succeed together in condemning certain fishermen in troubled waters who fuel conflicts and destabilize other States.@@@Let us dare to say that the political and security instability of the countries of the South, especially in Africa, arises from the desire of Powers that want to guide the internal policies of developing countries.@@@Africa in particular, having become the arena for geopolitical clashes among great Powers, is still years behind in terms of economic development.@@@It is that economic deficit that has become the cause of the internal conflicts that continue to push our countries into extreme poverty.@@@At the same time as we protest external interference in the affairs of States, we also condemn the resurgence of unconstitutional changes of power, which constitute a serious setback to the democratic gains recorded over several years in Africa and around the world.@@@The constitutional order and the rule of law must take precedence above all.@@@My country reiterates its firm commitment to the peaceful resolution of conflicts through dialogue, cooperation, consultation and negotiation.@@@Generally speaking, peace, security and stability in the world seem to be giving way to war, terrorism and violent extremism, crimes and violence of all kinds.@@@In that respect, at a time when the African Union Transitional Mission in Somalia is preparing to withdraw in the coming months as its successful mandate comes to an end.@@@I salute the professionalism and sacrifice of the troops committed to peace in Somalia, including the Burundian contingent.@@@I also take this opportunity to draw the attention of the international community to the consequences of the hasty closure of the Mission, which risks giving terrorist groups the opportunity to strengthen themselves.@@@Concerning the climate crisis.@@@I welcome the commitments already made by States, in particular through the various international consultations on the climate issue to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to finance environmental protection, climate resilience and the green transition of less polluting countries.@@@We want to see those commitments followed up by concrete action, because the failure to mobilize $100 billion per year since 2020 through the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, and annually until 2025, endangers future generations.@@@We believe that the twenty-eighth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which will be held this year in Dubai, will be an excellent opportunity to transform promises into realities.@@@Regarding the intensification of the migratory phenomenon, we are all aware of its scale and of the resulting threats to peace and security.@@@Indeed, that movement, which worries rich countries, is the consequence of poverty because migrants in search of a 
better life leave deprived areas to earn a living in more affluent areas.@@@Reducing the migratory phenomenon will necessarily involve the adoption of appropriate and concerted measures enabling young people to improve their chances of finding decent work, self-employment or entrepreneurship opportunities, particularly through the implementation of programmes aimed at achieving the objectives of sustainable development at the national level.@@@We are called upon to focus our efforts on a global partnership that seeks to combat poverty in all its forms.@@@However, while awaiting a lasting solution, the countries of transit and destination should understand and provide dignified and humane assistance to migrants and guarantee them the enjoyment of their fundamental human rights.@@@Respect for human rights is a subject on which we all agree.@@@May those rights be universal and indivisible for all.@@@My country has always opposed discrimination, the weaponization of human rights and their treatment by double standards.@@@We condemn States that, under the pretext of protecting human rights, use them as a means of interfering in the internal affairs of States.@@@Likewise, we are against politically motivated resolutions targeting particular States, as well as the implementation of mechanisms stifling targeted States without any form of constructive dialogue.@@@Allow me, before closing my speech, to reaffirm our commitment to the democratization of the multilateral system, including the reform of the Security Council and the international financial system, to make them more representative, fair, inclusive and able to more effectively tackle emerging challenges around the world.@@@International law recognizes the principle of the sovereign equality of all States .which must therefore enjoy the same international rights and duties, including in the sensitive sector of maintaining international peace and security.@@@I thank the States members of the Security Council, some of which understand the wish long expressed by Africa.@@@On this International Day of Peace.@@@I would like to close my speech by paying vibrant tribute to our valiant peacekeepers wherever they may be, because they defend a universal cause that transcends all our differences.@@@For peace, let us rebuild trust and revive international solidarity.@@@From the homeland of the liberator Simon Bolivar and Commander Hugo Chavez Frias, we convey warm greetings on behalf of the constitutional President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.@@@Nicolas Maduro Moros, and the entire Venezuelan people.@@@Allow us to congratulate the President of the General Assembly on his election.@@@We wish to express 
our solidarity with the sister nations of Libya and Morocco over the recent and painful loss of lives due to natural disasters.@@@It is 78 years since the historic moment when humankind, having defeated fascism and Nazism, envisioned the creation of a space where dialogue among all States would prevail, on the basis of which we could build global stability and cooperation on the pillars of peace and security, human rights and sustainable development.@@@Eighteen years ago, at this very rostrum, our Commander Hugo Chavez Frias said:
“the United Nations has outgrown its model.@@@It is not just a question of simple reform.@@@The twenty- first century requires profound changes that will be possible only if the Organization is truly recast.”@@@(A/60/PV.6, p. 17)@@@As painful as it is to acknowledge, that statement remains relevant.@@@The United Nations has not been able to fulfil its founding purpose, and we now face much more serious challenges.@@@The United Nations has not managed to overcome the unilateralism of countries that, by replicating a colonial and imperial rationale, seek to assert themselves over and above the principles enshrined in this Organization’s founding Charter.@@@The solution to the new and complex challenges facing humankind today cannot be achieved without consolidating inclusive multilateralism, the democratization of international relations and a genuine multipolar system.@@@Today we see how many agencies, funds and programmes of the United Nations system fail to fulfil their mandates and end up being exploited by the interests of the United States of America and its allies.@@@We must reform the Organization to make it a democratic institution in which all Members have a voice and participate in decision-making on equal terms.@@@It is crucial to return to the practice of consensus, including within this General Assembly, which requires ending the zero-sum mentality and, instead, promoting a win-win vision that allows us to effectively address collective interests through cooperation, tolerance and understanding.@@@It is equally necessary to move forward with the reform of the Security Council to correct historical imbalances and provide greater representation to our mother Africa in that important organ.@@@The United Nations cannot continue to operate as it is.@@@How many resolutions must this General Assembly adopt to put an end once and for all to the criminal blockade against our sister Cuba?@@@How many more resolutions must this General Assembly or the Security Council itself, the decisions of which are legally binding, adopt for the rights of Palestine to be truly respected as a free and independent State?@@@We wonder how many more summits it will take for us to realize that the commitments we have made, particularly in the area of development, have not been fulfilled?@@@How much more time must pass for us to realize that, under the current system, it is impossible to achieve the goals that we have set for ourselves?@@@Since the year 2000, when we agreed on the now defunct Millennium Development Goals, no less than 30 summits have been convened by the United Nations.@@@It is crucial to move forward without further delay regarding the reform of the international financial architecture, including the governance and decision-making methods of the Bretton Woods institutions, which serve the interests of a minority of wealthy countries, which also politicize them to exert pressure and domination over sovereign nations.@@@The restructuring of the United Nations involves settling the historical debt of decolonization.@@@Our peoples were victims of the crimes of colonization and slavery.@@@A just future is possible only if reparations are made for the recognition, justice and development of historically affected populations.@@@We also reiterate our strong support for Argentina.@@@Mauritius and the Comoros in their sovereignty disputes over the Falkland Islands, the Chagos archipelago and Mayotte island, respectively, as well as for the heroic brotherly peoples of Palestine.@@@Puerto Rico and Western Sahara, with whom we firmly stand in their just claim for their inalienable right to self-determination and the realization of their legitimate national aspirations.@@@In the past few hours, very worrisome events have taken place.@@@The Government of the United States of America, believing itself to be sovereign over our continent under the pretext of the illegal Monroe Doctrine, has once again intervened in a territorial dispute over our territory of Guay ana Esequiba, which has lasted for more than 200 years.@@@The origin of that dispute lies in the dispossession of our territory by the British Empire during the height of its violence in the nineteenth century.@@@The imperialist aggression was 
imposed on us by the Powers of the time in 1899 under false pretences.@@@Today the Government of the United States of America seeks to appropriate our oil resources through the ExxonMobil company, which has incorporated the Government of Guyana into its ranks.@@@Guyana is granting oil concessions in undelimited maritime territory, in complete violation of international law.@@@It is not possible to utilize a disputed territory unilaterally, but the Co-operative Republic of Guyana persists in its illegal conduct.@@@We condemn the fact that the Government of the United States of America intends to militarize the situation.@@@The Southern Command seeks to establish a military base in the contested territory, with the aim of creating a launching pad for its aggression against Venezuela and entrenching the plunder of our energy resources.@@@Two days ago, the National Assembly of Venezuela unanimously decided to call on our people to participate in a consultative referendum to reaffirm the defence of our sovereign territory in the face of the aggression of the American empire, which seeks to lead us into a war over natural resources.@@@The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela reaffirms its commitment to peace, but also its resolute determination to safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity.@@@The protection of cyberspace, the fight against cybercrime, the regulation of new information technologies, social media and artificial intelligence must become a strategic priority for the United Nations.@@@If we truly advocate for the defence of human rights and democratic principles, we must promote fair and equitable regulation that does not allow the focus of those new tools to be for the interests and control of a few.@@@Neither can we accept the use of those new technologies to destabilize legitimate Governments and destroy social harmony and peace.@@@In that regard, our country has serious and legitimate concerns given the destabilization, espionage, sabotage and cyberattacks that have been carried out in recent years against the banking sector, the electrical supply, the oil industry and national health-care systems.@@@In order to reclaim the founding spirit of the United Nations, hate speech and practices must be mitigated, and the attempts by some sectors to promote racist, discriminatory and xenophobic trends must be unequivocally rejected.@@@Those trends seek to revive and even glorify ideologies that we thought were overcome, such as fascism.@@@Nazism, neo-Nazism, white supremacism and nationalist radicalism.@@@While such phenomena have their main manifestations in Europe and the United States of America, our own region of Latin America and the Caribbean has not been exempt from such events.@@@Fifty years ago, a just man, who dared to speak great truths from this very rostrum and called on us to work for a fairer international economic order, the martyr President Salvador Allende, was assassinated by fascists acting on behalf of transnational capital interests.@@@In more recent times, political extremism and the culture of hatred driven by similar interests instigated the attack on our Head of State and Government in 2018, as well as the assassination attempt on our colleague Mrs. Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner.@@@Vice-President of the Argentine Republic.@@@Added to that is the attempt to disregard the democratic will of the Brazilian people at the beginning of this year and the recent developments in the sister Republic of Ecuador.@@@Using double standards, those who claim to defend freedoms become persecutors.@@@Those who claim to defend democracy activate mechanisms of political persecution to reverse democratic processes or to restrict the freedom of expression, as in the case of Julian Assange, who remains a political target of those who cannot forgive him for revealing the true nature of imperialist interventionism.@@@We also condemn the persecution of diplomats, in clear violation of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, as in the case of our diplomat Alex Saab, who was illegally kidnapped by the Government of the United States of America.@@@We demand his immediate release.@@@That kind of persecution jeopardizes the security and integrity of all diplomatic envoys worldwide, regardless of their nationality.@@@From the United Nations, we call on all countries to condemn that nefarious practice.@@@The current crisis of global leadership, including within this very Organization, coupled with the polarization prevailing in our world, exacerbates the current global crisis and threatens to entrench a Cold War mentality in international relations, based on confrontation, deepening divisions and the imposition of competing visions and agendas.@@@An example of that is the irresponsible provocations by the most powerful military force in the world, which, by dividing the world into power blocs, exacerbates 
conflicts, pushing humankind into an arms race, which can lead only to the destruction of life on our planet.@@@Let us count how much has been invested in armaments and how much in promoting spaces for diplomacy and dialogue, and we will sadly realize how many opportunities to save lives we have lost.@@@We express our concern at the rapid increase in military spending in recent months, reaching levels unseen in the past generations.@@@That is about a new and alarming arms race that diverts resources that would be of greater benefit to humankind if they were used not only in financing development agendas or fighting poverty, but also in addressing the food crisis and the climate crisis that currently threatens our world.@@@We support the proposal of Colombian President Gustavo Petro Urrego to convene a world conference for peace in Ukraine and in Palestine.@@@We call for addressing those issues in a balanced and cautious manner, reducing tensions and promoting confidence-building measures, not only in Eastern Europe, but also on the Korean peninsula and in Western Asia.@@@We are confident that that will create a conducive environment for the success of diplomatic efforts for peace.@@@Venezuela is committed to the Declaration of Latin America and the Caribbean as a Zone of Peace.@@@We actively participate in the reconciliation process in the Republic of Colombia, convinced that the achievement of complete peace for our sisters and brothers will lead to strengthening regional peace.@@@The world still faces a major pandemic — the pernicious effects of an aggressive policy, manifested in the illegal imposition of unilateral coercive measures against a third of humankind.@@@The so-called sanctions, in violation of all norms of international law and the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, represent mass violations of human rights for millions of people.@@@Such measures are applied precisely by those who then claim to present themselves as champions of human rights.@@@They are also a deliberate attack on the right to development of entire peoples and an impediment to the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which we have discussed to such an extent throughout this week.@@@Those illegal measures have created a crisis in the system of international relations, and we therefore demand their complete, immediate and unconditional lifting.@@@It is unacceptable to our peoples, who daily resist the effects of a criminal blockade policy, for the General Assembly to seek to disregard such a disgrace in its policy documents.@@@We therefore cannot endorse any declaration that ignores or omits that pivotal issue for the lives and existence of hundreds of millions of human beings.@@@How much our countries could improve the quality of life for our peoples, eradicate hunger or cure diseases if we were allowed to fully develop our capacities, based on our potential.@@@The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has been a victim of a cruel policy of aggression and siege.@@@More than 930 unilateral coercive measures have been imposed on our country by the Government of the United States of America and its accomplices.@@@Those illegal measures have caused great pain and suffering for our people, with economic losses amounting to more than $232 billion, a steep drop in our gross domestic product and the confiscation of billions of dollars in sovereign resources held in the international financial system, including 31 tons of gold seized by the British Government in the Bank of England.@@@Not even the coronavirus disease pandemic was reason enough to lift those illegal measures.@@@Today we face a new wave of crueller and more destructive unilateral coercive measures, which affect access to vaccines, food and other basic goods and services, turning such atrocities into true crimes against humanity.@@@The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has recommended the suspension and lifting of all unilateral coercive measures harmful to human rights.@@@Venezuela demands a complete, immediate and unconditional end to all illegal policies of sanctions and economic, commercial and financial blockades imposed on Venezuela.@@@Cuba.@@@Eritrea.@@@Iran.@@@Nicaragua.@@@Syria.@@@Zimbabwe and other sister nations, which have successfully weathered those imperial policies through determination and commitment.@@@In that context, we thank all the peoples of the world and the many sister nations that have called for the lifting of sanctions from platforms such as the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America-Peoples’ Trade Agreement, the Caribbean Community and the Southern African Development Community, as well as every country in this very Hall that has demanded that the sanctions be removed.@@@That demonstrates that Venezuela has never been alone.@@@Without the obstacle of unilateral coercive measures.@@@Venezuela is prepared to be part of the solution to the crisis, particularly in the areas of food security and energy.@@@We propose the establishment of a zone free of unilateral coercive measures, in which we can conduct our financial transactions and interbank payments, enabling us to ensure direct investments and legal trade among our nations without risk or arbitrary or punitive impediments from Western Powers.@@@Nevertheless, despite the difficulties and aggression, our Government’s commitment to eradicating poverty, achieving social justice and fully enjoying our human rights, as well as to the sister peoples of our Latin America and the world, is unwavering.@@@Despite the attacks, aggression, siege and looting resulting from unilateral coercive measures, the Venezuelan economy has begun a process of recovery, with projected growth figures far surpassing those of other countries of our region, as highlighted by the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean and other specialized organizations.@@@Such results, achieved through our own efforts, have made us a regional benchmark for economic growth, while never neglecting the essential — protecting our people through social investment.@@@We are facing an existential climate catastrophe for millions of people, especially our brothers and sisters from small island developing States, in both the Caribbean and the Pacific.@@@The effects of years of climate injustice, marked by unsustainable patterns of consumption and production, have accelerated in recent years.@@@Libya has been one of the most recent victims of the impacts of climate change, also affecting our country, which has experienced floods and record temperatures in recent months.@@@In renewing our firm commitment to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement, we stress the need to ensure adequate funding for the loss and damage fund, always bearing in mind the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities and equity.@@@We know that the resources exist, where they are and who has them.@@@As Commander Chavez Frias said 14 years ago, let us not change the climate; let us change the system.@@@Given the economic and financial crisis that particularly affects developing countries, we need a new model for the mechanisms of global governance, where the global South has fair access to international financing.@@@Until there is a genuine and effective reform of the multilateral system in the financial sphere, the Sustainable Development Goals, the focus of this session, are doomed not to be met.@@@Debt is a crucial issue for developing countries, and there is little hope that things will improve soon if the current system is not radically changed.@@@The World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and Western credit institutions in general, while charging their friends low interest rates, burden developing countries with unpayable interest rates, which some experts have termed criminal financial apartheid.@@@That neocolonialist system of plunder and financial dependence must be rooted out.@@@Among the major challenges facing humankind today, in the context of that global systemic crisis, in which this Organization has a fundamental role to play, is the phenomenon of international migration.@@@We cannot allow migrants to be stigmatized and criminalized.@@@President Nicolas Maduro Moros requests the support of the United Nations to hold an international conference in Venezuela, without any exclusion, to reach joint agreements and commitments to address the phenomenon of migratory flows from a comprehensive and humanistic perspective — a genuine international commitment to ensuring the rights of migrants to citizenship, identity, dignified work, social security and respect for their dignity.@@@We, the free peoples, are building a new world order.@@@That new multipolar and multi-centric world of peace and economic prosperity, free from hegemony, anchored in the United Nations Charter, must be based on the values of genuine multilateralism, international cooperation and solidarity.@@@In that regard, we acknowledge the contribution of the Brazil.@@@Russia.@@@India.@@@China and South Africa (BRICS) bloc, which Venezuela aspires to join, to the current global geopolitics and the democratization of international relations.@@@We also applaud the efforts of countries that contribute to dialogue, understanding, global peace and common progress, such as the People’s Republic of China.@@@Venezuela supports its Global Development Initiative, its Global Security Initiative and its Global Civilization Initiative.@@@It is through common efforts, in a spirit of complementarity, solidarity and cooperation, that we can change the course towards a common destiny of prosperity and stability for all humankind.@@@It is up to us to save the system of international relations from the threats that currently loom over it.@@@It is up to us to preserve the principles of the United Nations Charter, on which international law is based.@@@It is up to us to make our people’s aspirations for peace and security, sustainable development and human rights a reality.@@@Cognizant of that historic task.@@@Venezuela, together with a group of countries from various regions of the world, undertook the task of building a platform from which all responsible members of the international community can be mobilized to preserve, promote and strengthen the founding treaty of our Organization.@@@Thus, two years ago, the Group of Friends in Defence of the Charter of the United Nations was born, which has now positioned itself as a key actor in various intergovernmental processes taking place in this multilateral forum.@@@As our President.@@@Nicolas Maduro Moros, said a few weeks ago at the BRICS Plus summit:
“Definitely, unity is what makes strength, and that united strength promotes a new global relationship paradigm and promotes a new twenty-first-century global geopolitics”.@@@Let us work together so that the United Nations also becomes an organization that meets the needs of peoples for this century.@@@In recent years, much has been said about Venezuela.@@@Much disinformation has been spread through major media corporations and social networks about the reality of what is happening in our country.@@@Many attempts have been made to disseminate a media campaign through so-called fake news, with the aim of deploying a humanitarian intervention in our country, in flagrant violation of our sovereignty.@@@However, thanks to Bolivarian peace diplomacy, under the leadership of President Nicolas Maduro Moros, the truth about Venezuela has always prevailed and has always resonated strongly within the United Nations.@@@Today the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela is in complete peace and tranquillity.@@@Dialogue has been an ongoing policy of the Bolivarian revolution and has prevailed as the only option on the table, without foreign interference or tutelage of any kind, and within the framework of our national Constitution, to settle differences that exist in our nation and that are characteristic of the robust Venezuelan democratic system.@@@We have been, are and always will always a country open to, and ready for, respectful debate among equals.@@@Those who tried to subjugate our people through economic terrorism, hunger, disease, foreign invasion, the thwarted assassination of our Head of State and Government and the imposition of fictitious entities to promote a regime change agenda and facilitate the theft of national assets have failed miserably.@@@Dozens of countries took a senseless and foolish position, which, unfortunately, rendered them ridiculous in the eyes of history.@@@Today the vast majority of those countries, with few exceptions, have overcome the awkward episode and have returned to the path of diplomacy and understanding among equals.@@@In Venezuela, we continue to stand tall, fighting alongside our people, in perfect harmony with all sectors of the country and heading towards a new electoral process, which, despite the campaigns that have already been launched to discredit it or question it, we are sure will result in new victories of the people, based on the sovereign will of the Venezuelan people.@@@Once again, in 2024, we will go to the polling stations in a civic and collective manner to reiterate support for the Bolivarian revolutionary socialist movement initiated by the eternal Commander Hugo Chavez Frias.@@@Allow me to conclude by reiterating that Venezuela remains determined to be the master of its destiny and to exercise its sovereignty, resolved to continue to consolidate its independence and its right to live in peace.@@@Our nation and our people will never yield to pressure, blackmail or threats and will remain free.@@@Today we find ourselves in high spirits and with a heightened awareness and unity to continue to move forward in building a homeland of social justice, solidarity and inclusion, inspired by our liberators and the enduring will of a people who does not surrender and will never surrender, determined to continue to triumph in revolution.@@@In today’s challenging and turbulent times, the international community needs integration and trust more than ever.@@@We are now witnessing alarming developments in the international arena, against the backdrop of increasing modern threats and challenges.@@@Terrorism, extremism, transnational organized crime, rapid armament and the escalation of the Cold War imperil international peace, security and development.@@@At the same time, the disastrous impacts of climate change — extreme heat, floods, droughts, fires and other natural disasters, in addition to water shortages and famine — pose a serious threat to humanity.@@@In that context, joint concerted efforts to address these threats and challenges and to achieve the goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development have become more imperative.@@@To that end, we welcome the theme of the seventy-eighth session of the General Assembly.@@@“Rebuilding trust and reigniting global solidarity: Accelerating action on the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals towards peace, prosperity, progress and sustainability for all.”@@@Despite the international community’s efforts to implement the 2030 Agenda, the world is not on track to meet most of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).@@@Unfortunately, developing countries, least developed countries and small island developing States are bearing the brunt of that.@@@While Tajikistan has made significant progress on some of the SDGs, in particular Goals 1. 7. 12 and 13, the country still faces challenges in fulfilling its pledge to achieve the SDGs by 2030.@@@Therefore, we understand that solidarity, financing, the implementation of commitments and other practical measures should be strengthened, and doing so requires a truly fundamental shift.@@@Tajikistan therefore supported the Secretary- General’s proposal made by the Secretary-General in his report.@@@Our Common Agenda (A/75/982), to reverse the course and turbocharge the SDGs.@@@We also welcome the Secretary-General’s SDG Stimulus to Deliver Agenda 2030 and call for at least $500 billion to be made available to developing countries, least developed countries and small island developing States annually in order to accelerate progress on the 2030 Agenda.@@@We also welcome the call to reform the international financial architecture in order to ensure the mobilization of stable and long-term financing and investments, among other things, to achieve the SDGs and tackle climate issues.@@@As we can all observe, climate change impacts are increasing across the globe.@@@This year we witnessed the highest air temperature recorded in the period since observations began.@@@Asia is warming faster than the global average, according to the World Meteorological Organization’s most recent State of the Global Climate report.@@@The negative consequences of that process, such as droughts, floods, landslides and fires in different regions of the world, including Tajikistan, are very alarming phenomena.@@@With 93 per cent of its territory covered by mountains.@@@Tajikistan is experiencing the impact of climate change first-hand and is considered one of the countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change.@@@Frequent climate-related disasters in the form of landslides, mudflows, floods and droughts in Tajikistan result in loss of human life and infrastructure on an annual basis.@@@To that end.@@@Tajikistan attaches particular importance to the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, which contains calls to promote the improvement of early warning systems, to increase investments in programmes on natural disaster risk reduction and to render financial assistance to developing countries.@@@Tajikistan is one of the pilot countries implementing the Secretary-General’s Early Warnings for All initiative.@@@More than 13 thousand glaciers are registered in the Republic of Tajikistan.@@@Sixty per cent of the region’s water resources form in our country.@@@Unfortunately, over the past decades.@@@Tajikistan has lost more than 1.000 glaciers, with significant implications for future food security, water availability and the ecosystems of Central Asia and beyond.@@@The intense melting of glaciers, which are the primary source of fresh water, requires the adoption of concrete measures, including research, data collection and processing and enhanced international cooperation.@@@I express my gratitude to all Member States for their cooperation in adopting General Assembly 77/158 of 14 December 2022, which declares 2025 the International Year of Glaciers’ Preservation.@@@I invite all interested parties to join efforts to ensure the targeted implementation of the resolution.@@@We stand ready to work with the international community within the newly created Group of Friends of Glaciers and beyond to implement the mandates contained in the resolution.@@@Tajikistan is convinced that that initiative will give a powerful impetus to a new global movement to take necessary collective action and to protect glaciers from intense melting.@@@I would also like to highlight the successful outcomes of the United Nations Conference on the Midterm Comprehensive Review of the Implementation of the Objectives of the International Decade for Action.@@@“Water for Sustainable Development”.@@@2018- 2028.@@@I believe that fulfilling the commitments made by the international community at the Conference will contribute to achieving Goal 6 and addressing other internationally agreed water-related goals.@@@Recently, following the Conference, the General Assembly unanimously adopted another resolution, proposed by Tajikistan, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and Senegal.@@@We hope that Member States and other partners will join our efforts in that process.@@@It is worth noting that Dushanbe will host the third International High-level Conference on the International Decade for Action.@@@“Water for Sustainable Development”.@@@2018-2028, in 2024 and the International Conference on Glaciers’ Preservation in 2025.@@@We expect the international community to take an active part in those important international conferences.@@@As a proactive country that champions the global water and climate agenda.@@@Tajikistan will continue to strive to promote cooperation between countries and organizations.@@@In modern conditions, the formation of a green economy has become one of humankind’s urgent tasks.@@@In our country.@@@98 per cent of electricity is produced from renewable sources, that is, hydropower, and Tajikistan ranks sixth in the world in that aspect.@@@Tajikistan’s effective and rational use of its tremendous hydropower resources can provide a favourable basis for the development of green energy generation throughout the region.@@@We consider the role of the Green Climate Fund to be positive and constructive in the process of addressing environmental challenges and adapting to climate change.@@@In support of the Fund’s strategic plan for 2024-2027, we invite Member States, especially developed countries, and other stakeholders to contribute to financing its implementation.@@@Regional solidarity and integration are of paramount importance in today’s interconnected world.@@@It enables countries to address shared challenges, promote peace and respond effectively to emergencies.@@@Currently, as a result of joint measures taken by the countries of Central Asia, a favourable atmosphere has been created for strengthening regional integration.@@@It was fully demonstrated during the fifth consultative meeting of the Heads of State of Central Asia, which took place on 14 and 15 September in Dushanbe.@@@That initiative will contribute to a stable atmosphere of peace, cooperation, sustainable development and prosperity in our region.@@@Security, stability and regional cooperation in Central Asia are directly linked with the situation in neighbouring Afghanistan.@@@Afghanistan continues to face a difficult political, economic and social situation.@@@As stated by the Secretary-General.@@@97 per cent of Afghans live in poverty.@@@In this challenging time.@@@Tajikistan reaffirms its commitment to continue providing humanitarian assistance and allowing the use of its infrastructure, including six bridges on its border, to support the Afghan people.@@@I would like to take this opportunity to once again appeal to the international community to increase the volume of humanitarian aid to the suffering people of Afghanistan.@@@In that regard, we are ready for further increased cooperation with international partners and other interested parties.@@@We continue to consider the establishment of intra-Afghan dialogue and the creation of a truly inclusive Government, with the participation of representatives of all peoples, nations and political and social groups, as an important basis for achieving lasting peace and genuine stability in Afghanistan.@@@Drug trafficking, especially from Afghanistan, has increased dramatically over the past two years.@@@During that period, the competent authorities of Tajikistan seized more than 10 tons of narcotics on the border with that country, which is several times more than in previous years.@@@The Government of Tajikistan is continuously taking practical measures within the framework of its national strategy for combating terrorism and extremism for 2021-2025.@@@In cooperation with the international community, we intend to hold the next international conference on counter-terrorism and its financing in Dushanbe in 2024.@@@Tajikistan reiterates that the response to the growing threats of terrorism, extremism, trafficking in narcotics and other global modern threats and challenges must be comprehensive and uncompromising.@@@In that connection, we believe that the Office of Counter-Terrorism can and should contribute effectively to the integrated and balanced implementation of the United Nations Global Counter-@@@Terrorism Strategy and other relevant documents to address all aspects of that threat and challenge.@@@The efforts should also be focused on preventing the use of the Internet for radicalization, recruitment and propaganda in service of extremism and violence.@@@Tajikistan welcomes the adoption in June of the eighth review of the United Nations Global Counter-terrorism Strategy.@@@We believe it provides a robust framework in further guiding our counter-terrorism efforts.@@@The fabric of our societies is woven with the threads of different cultures, traditions and faiths.@@@That solidarity is a good basis for peaceful life in a space of mutual understanding between different cultures and religions.@@@In that regard, manifestations of discrimination or racial and religious hostility, with an understanding of their negative consequences, are absolutely unacceptable.@@@Those actions, as well the politicization of religious issues, undermine the very essence of our international community.@@@Insulting religious sentiments or perpetrating hatred or violence against any religion or belief has tragic consequences.@@@In most cases, such provocative actions trigger intolerance and mistrust, causing divisions and conflicts among civilizations.@@@In that sense.@@@Tajikistan strongly condemns any insult to the religious sanctity of peoples, including the Holy Qur’an and other cultural and religious values of humankind.@@@As a co-sponsor of the resolution entitled “Promoting inter-religious and intercultural dialogue and tolerance in countering hate speech” (resolution 77/318), recently adopted by the Assembly.@@@Tajikistan reiterates the importance of promoting dialogue and mutual understanding among civilizations for peace and harmony in the world.@@@We believe that spreading the values of tolerance and peace is the best way to confront hate speech, fanaticism, extremism, violence and incitement.@@@Let us stand united against actions that seek to divide us and instead work towards a world in which mutual respect and recognition are the cornerstones of our global society.@@@As a nation that has demonstrated resilience, stability and commitment to peace.@@@Tajikistan seeks to secure a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for 2028-2029.@@@I take this opportunity to call on the Member States to render their valuable support for Tajikistan’s candidacy during the 2027 elections.@@@In conclusion.@@@I would like to once again emphasize that achieving all our agreed goals will be possible only based on mutual understanding, coordination, integration and tolerance.@@@To that end, allow me to recite a poem from the famous Tajik-Persian poet, writer and thinker Saadi Shirazi that is very relevant, speaks to the theme of the seventy-eighth session of the General Assembly and corresponds to our shared commitments: “Human beings are members of a whole;@@@In the creation of one essence and soul.@@@If one member is afflicted with pain; Other members uneasy will remain”.@@@It is a great honour for me to convey the cordial greetings of His Excellency Colonel Assimi Goita.@@@President of the Transition and Head of State of Mali, on behalf of all the Malian people.@@@From this rostrum.@@@I am also speaking on behalf of His Excellency Brigadier General Abdourahamane Tiani.@@@President of the National Council for the Safeguarding of the Homeland and Head of State of the Niger, precluded from speaking at the rostrum of this General Assembly session.@@@First of all.@@@I would like to reiterate the sympathy of the authorities and people of Mali to the authorities and the people of Morocco.@@@Libya.@@@Turkey and Syria following the natural disasters that have plunged those brother countries into mourning.@@@Peace and security remain the priority for the populations of Mali and the Sahel after more than a decade of violence, with particularly devastating consequences.@@@Yet that region was known as a haven of peace, social cohesion and coexistence among its communities.@@@For its part.@@@Mali has decided to change its paradigm and take its destiny into its own hands.@@@In terms of security.@@@Mali has therefore prioritized strengthening the capacities of the Malian Defence and Security Forces to enable them to discharge their sovereign duties of defending the national territory and protecting people and property.@@@Today the Malian people have regained trust in their defence system.@@@Today the people of Mali are encouraged by the results achieved in the fight against armed terrorist groups and their foreign State sponsors.@@@Mali once again strongly condemns the interference of certain Powers that continue to enable the criminal activities of terrorist armed groups in Mali and the Sahel.@@@It should be recalled that, on 15 August 2022, the Government of Mali alerted the Security Council to France’s acts of hostility and aggression (see S/2022/622).@@@Instead of putting a stop to such practices, that country, a permanent member of the Security Council, continues its tactics to destabilize Mali and the Sahel with complete impunity, as demonstrated by the recent release of terrorists in the tri-border area of Burkina Faso.@@@Mali and the Niger, outside any judicial framework and without the knowledge of the States concerned, to perpetrate more terrorist acts against our civilian populations and our defence and security forces.@@@France’s hostile actions are also illustrated by its ill-timed and illegal interventions to delay, or even prevent, the processing of our requests for funding from several subregional, regional and even international financial institutions.@@@In the same vein, it is regrettable that the same country.@@@France, tries to exploit African subregional organizations, and sometimes unfortunately succeeds, pitting brother countries against each other solely for its own geopolitical interests in a neocolonial and paternalistic approach.@@@Mali is aware of the fact that military action alone is not enough to put a lasting end to the complex challenges posed by terrorism and to certain issues of governance in the country.@@@That is why the Government has adopted a comprehensive strategy, which includes political and institutional reform, development and addressing the specific concerns of young people and women, including employment and their representation in local and national decision-making bodies.@@@To create the conditions that will enable the Malian people’s deep-seated aspirations for change to be realized, the Government is committed to implementing the political and institutional reforms needed to rebuild the State.@@@As part of that process, a referendum on Mali’s new Constitution, which was adopted by more than 96 per cent, was successfully held on 18 June.@@@Its promulgation by the Head of State on 22 July marks the advent of the Fourth Republic of Mali.@@@By taking that step, the Government of Mali is demonstrating its genuine resolve to return to a peaceful and secure constitutional order, including the holding of general elections in the coming months.@@@After 10 years of presence in my country, the international response to Mali’s security challenges has not been commensurate with the threats.@@@The expectations of the Malian people, repeatedly expressed by the authorities, have therefore often been ignored.@@@The United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) has been unable to help Mali to re-establish its authority over its entire territory despite the substantial resources invested in it over the past 10 years.@@@During its presence on the national territory, regrettably, the security situation in Mali has only deteriorated.@@@Insecurity, which was confined to Mali’s northern regions at the time of its deployment in 2013, has now spread to the central and southern regions.@@@That spread of insecurity is fortunately now abating thanks to the undeniable achievements on the ground by the Malian armed forces despite the challenges associated with that kind of operation.@@@Despite the difficulties faced by MINUSMA due to the fact that the Mission is ill-suited to the security context, namely, peacekeeping in an environment in which there is no peace to keep, the Government of Mali had come to terms with the Mission’s passive presence.@@@However, it became unacceptable for the Government of Mali to allow MINUSMA to continue to be part of the problem by exacerbating tensions among our communities and by exploiting the issue of human rights for political ends, thereby serving the foreign agendas of countries hostile to Mali.@@@After an in-depth assessment, in June the Government of Mali therefore requested the immediate withdrawal of MINUSMA.@@@We are pleased that the Security Council accepted our request.@@@The Government of Mali is working with MINUSMA for its orderly, coordinated and safe withdrawal by the set deadline of 31 December, in accordance with the relevant provisions of resolution 2690 (2023), adopted by the Security Council on 30 June.@@@The Government of the Republic of Mali does not intend to extend that deadline.@@@The Government reassures the people of Mali and the international community that every measure has been taken to ensure the continuity of State services after the departure of MINUSMA.@@@The first phase of the withdrawal process has been completed, and the second phase is already under way.@@@It is true that MINUSMA was not able to fulfil its mandate, but the Malian Government and people remain grateful for the efforts and sacrifices made over the past 10 years in Mali.@@@I would like to pay tribute to the memory of all the victims, civilian and military.@@@Malian and foreign, who fell on the field of honour in Mali.@@@However, the withdrawal of MINUSMA does not mean the end of cooperation between Mali and the Organization.@@@On the contrary, my country is committed to its membership of the United Nations, and the Government remains committed to the principles and noble ideals of the Charter.@@@Likewise.@@@Mali renews its commitment to cooperating with all States in the world that so wish and that respect the fundamental principles of my country’s foreign policy.@@@In a spirit of national ownership, the Government is committed to pursuing the effective and judicious implementation of the Agreement on Peace and Reconciliation in Mali emanating from the Algiers process, together with our brothers in the signatory movements who so wish.@@@We are delighted with the progress already made since the Agreement was signed in 2015, including the adoption of the new Constitution, which incorporates several of the Agreement’s provisions.@@@From now on, the Government has decided to give priority to intra-Malian dialogue to further the peace process with the signatory groups.@@@The Government is aware of the challenges on the road to peace, such as the grisly series of indiscriminate terrorist attacks against civilians and members of the Malian Defence and Security Forces.@@@The savage and barbaric attack on the boat Timbuktu and the assaults on camps in the towns of Bamba.@@@Gao and Bourem between 7 and 12 September show the cruelty of those organized terrorist and criminal groups, which cowardly attack targets such as women and children.@@@On behalf of the Head of State of Mali and the Malian Government and people.@@@I would like to thank all the friendly nations and international organizations that have shown their compassion and their solidarity during those tragic events.@@@However, even given such tragic events, and at a time when the theme of our session calls on us for greater solidarity, it is regrettable that the Security Council has not reached a minimum consensus to, at the very least, condemn those barbaric acts. Despite such difficulties, or rather because of them, the Government 
of the Republic of Mali is more determined than ever to exercise its sovereignty, assert its authority — its full authority — over the entire national territory.@@@The Defence and Security Forces will continue their offensive against obscurantist attacks, and the response will be immediate and resolute.@@@That was recently the case in Bourem, where our brave soldiers repelled an attack by those criminal and obscurantist gangs by inflicting substantial losses on them.@@@As part of the drive to strengthen the State presence and authority, the State is committed to occupying all the areas vacated, or to be vacated, by MINUSMA.@@@Contrary to certain allegations, the occupation of those sites, which complies in every respect with United Nations texts, in no way represents an act of belligerence towards the signatory movements by the Malian State.@@@On the contrary, we continue to reach out to our brothers in the signatory movements for lasting peace and harmonious development for the benefit of our people.@@@To that end, we call on the armed groups to distance themselves from, and cease the collusion observed with, the terrorist armed groups during the most recent attacks, in accordance with the peace agreement and the various relevant Security Council resolutions.@@@In the current geopolitical context.@@@Mali does not wish to become a theatre of conflict or competition among the geopolitical interests of foreign Powers.@@@We remain willing to cooperate with all partners that respect our sovereignty, our choice of partnerships and the interests of the Malian people.@@@In the regional and international context.@@@Mali continues to pay close attention to ongoing developments in Africa and the rest of the world.@@@With regard to global governance, the Government of the Republic of Mali reiterates its commitment to respecting the United Nations Charter, in particular respect for the sovereign equality of States and, consequently, its condemnation of the activities of certain Powers to perpetuate neocolonial domination and to subjugate other peoples, other countries and other nations.@@@Mali pays close attention to institutional developments and regrets the fact that the assessment of recent regime changes in some African countries is based on the closeness of the new leaders to certain Powers or, simply, on geopolitical interests, while completely ignoring the aspirations of the populations of the countries concerned.@@@In that regard, we condemn and reject the policy of double standards employed by certain Powers and some regional and even international organizations, including the United Nations.@@@That inconsistency and manipulation serve only to undermine the credibility of our organizations in the eyes of the people and public opinion, thereby eroding their trust in those institutions, which are now perceived as having been hijacked from their primary purpose.@@@Some organizations are used, outside any legal or community framework, as weapons against the countries and populations that have freely joined them, sometimes at the cost of transferring sovereignty.@@@Such organizations therefore become instruments for perpetuating and imposing a neocolonial and hegemonic order.@@@In particular, we are following with great interest the developments in the Niger since 26 July.@@@The people and the Government of Mali reiterate their solidarity with, and full support for, the Government and the people of the Niger, a neighbourly and friendly brother country.@@@We condemn in principle the imposition of sanctions and unilateral coercive measures against any State, whether in Africa or elsewhere.@@@We condemn sanctions all the more when they are unjust, illegal and inhumane, such as those that the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the West African Economic and Monetary Union imposed on the Niger and, before that, on my country.@@@Mali, which has recovered.@@@The humanitarian consequences of the sanctions on the Niger are so dramatic that the Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator had to send a letter to the President of the ECOWAS Commission, calling on him to ease those measures.@@@I must recall that even in the war waged between Iraq and the United States a humanitarian corridor was opened to allow supplies to be delivered to the Iraqi people.@@@How is it that we in organizations founded on cooperation and fraternity can punish our own neighbours and brothers by preventing them from having food and medicines?
Furthermore.@@@Mail remains strongly opposed to any military intervention by ECOWAS, which would have disastrous consequences for the Niger, as well as the entire region.@@@Any military intervention in the Niger — I was going to say any aggression or invasion of that country — represents a direct threat to the peace and security of Mali and the region and will have serious consequences.@@@We will not stand idly by.@@@It is vital to avoid repeating the serious mistakes of the relatively recent past.@@@Member States will recall that in 2011, despite the firm opposition and warnings of African leaders, the Security Council unfortunately decided to authorize a military intervention in Libya by NATO, the consequences of which have had a lasting destabilizing effect on that brother country and the entire region.@@@NATO’s war in Libya is at the root of the spread of terrorism and violent extremism in the Sahel region, with all its innocent victims and destruction.@@@That is why we will never tire of recalling the international responsibility for the human tragedy experienced by Libya and the Sahel since that intervention.@@@On behalf of all victims since 2011 to the present day, the tens of thousands of deaths and the millions of displaced persons and refugees, we therefore demand justice and reparation.@@@But, above all, we demand that the international community assume its responsibilities and learn all the lessons from that risky military intervention by major Powers in a third country.@@@It is crucial to avoid repeating in the Niger the serious mistakes made in Libya, which are at the very root of the deteriorating situation in the entire Sahel region, including Burkina Faso.@@@Mali and the Niger.@@@That is vital to restoring trust among nations, as per the theme of our session.@@@The many challenges to international peace and security call for the reform of the existing architecture of the United Nations.@@@Mali reiterates its support for the legitimate demand of the African continent for reform of the Security Council so as to make it more representative of the realities of our time.@@@In the same vein.@@@Mali will continue to advocate for reform of global economic, financial and political governance in order to create optimal and fair conditions for the participation of our countries in multilateral institutions.@@@In that context.@@@Mali reaffirms the central role that Africa must play within international organizations and institutions.@@@In that regard.@@@Mali welcomes the opening up of the Brazil.@@@Russia.@@@India.@@@China and South Africa (BRICS) alliance to new member States, including African States.@@@The BRICS alliance and its mechanisms, including the bank, offer a flexible alternative tailored to the development needs of the countries of the global South.@@@In the same vein, the recent expansion of the Group of 20 to include the African Union is an encouraging sign, but it is not enough.@@@It is important that Africa’s participation in other international forums be stepped up in the name of justice and equity.@@@Climate change is a genuine threat to the current and future generations.@@@We must have the courage to move beyond the prevailing dogmatism and narrow interests surrounding that issue.@@@In that regard, the time has come to effectively implement the decisions of our summits and sessions of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.@@@It is more important than ever that the countries responsible for climate change assume their full and complete responsibilities, including that of supporting the efforts of countries of the South to achieve development that respects the environment.@@@I would like to recall that the United Nations was established in 1945, as we know, primarily to save future generations from the scourge of war.@@@That noble objective, enshrined in the United Nations Charter, is far from being achieved.@@@Indeed, the current geopolitical tensions and multiple conflicts around the world are real causes for concern for multilateralism, peaceful coexistence and harmonious development.@@@Let us take a break from the rhetoric of intimidation, threats and war.@@@As the theme of this seventy-eighth session invites us to do, let us work together to restore trust and rekindle global solidarity.@@@Let us dare to carry out reforms that help to build a world where everyone counts, a world where no one is left behind.@@@Let us work together to put in place effective, fair and inclusive international mechanisms to resolve crises rather than encouraging or even, in certain cases, perpetuating them.@@@As direct victims of the ongoing interference of certain countries in their internal affairs, the people of Mali and several other Sahelian States are unfortunately continuing to suffer the tragic consequences of multidimensional crises imposed and perpetuated by those who paradoxically come to give lessons in democracy and respect for human rights.@@@In implementing the Head of State’s vision for the emergence of a new Mali, free from any external neocolonial domination, the Government of the Republic of Mali is honoured to be able to count on sincere partners and on countries that value equal relations based on mutual respect.@@@In that regard.@@@I would like to make a special mention of the Russian Federation for its active solidarity and reliable commitment, both bilaterally and multilaterally.@@@Mali remains committed to strengthening African regional and subregional mechanisms that genuinely support the interests of the African people as a matter of priority.@@@Faithful to its pan-Africanist mission, reaffirmed in all its successive constitutions.@@@Mali reiterates its support for all relevant collective security mechanisms, particularly those in which African leadership is declared, as well as in those where manipulation is rejected and fought.@@@That is the essence behind the establishment of the Alliance of Sahel States on 16 September by Burkina Faso.@@@Mali and the Niger through the signing of the Liptako-Gourma Charter.@@@That organization seeks to set up a collective defence and mutual assistance framework in order to combat all forms of aggression, terrorism and cross-border organized crime in the common area of the Alliance.@@@The new organization also seeks to federate the efforts of the three countries in the socioeconomic and financial fields, as well as strengthen regional integration on a new basis, this time an integration of peoples based on solidarity, respect for the dignity and identity of our peoples and our countries; the affirmation of our sovereignty over our lands and resources, as well as our sovereignty over our organizations; financing our activities from our own resources; and the rejection of external interference, hegemonic policies, neocolonial domination and subjugation.@@@In addition to security mechanisms.@@@Mali fully supports African initiatives that strive to promote and strengthen ties of fraternity and solidarity, such as the African Political Alliance, launched by the sister Republic of Togo, which aspires to an independent, politically strong, unabashed and non-aligned Africa, capable of participating as an equal player as an actor in global governance.@@@In conclusion.@@@I would like to point out that the many challenges to peace, security and development require an overhauled, adapted and inclusive multilateral framework.@@@We can, and must, no longer continue to do the same thing with the same ill-adapted mechanisms and institutions and expect different results.@@@For its part.@@@Mali remains committed to a multilateralism in which every nation counts, a cooperative multilateralism that provides ambitious solutions to the challenges of our time, particularly in the Sahel, an open multilateralism that takes into account the deep-seated aspirations of our populations to change, dignity, respect, the sovereign equality of States, equity, justice, development, security and, lastly, peace.@@@It is with great pleasure that I take the floor at the General Assembly, at a time when the world faces a very complex situation that requires our Organization to strengthen its role and its ability to formulate the most appropriate responses in order to be able to tackle the serious challenges facing the world.@@@I would like to wish Mr. Dennis Francis all the best during his term of office, starting now, as the President of the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session.@@@I would also like to express my thanks to Mr. Antonio Guterres for his tireless efforts in service of peace and development under very challenging circumstances.@@@As I did not attend the session of the General Assembly held in 2022.1 did not have an opportunity to express, on behalf of Angola and Angolans, our views on and concerns about the problems facing the world, which were exacerbated by the eruption of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine in that year.@@@In spite of the great efforts made to create a more peaceful and prosperous world, we recognize that.@@@78 years after the founding of our Organization, it has not been possible to build a solid foundation of trust among nations in order to prevent the emergence of pockets of tension in a number of places, which have degenerated into open conflicts in Africa.@@@Asia.@@@Latin America, the Middle East and now in Europe, where a war of such large proportions as the one currently being waged was not expected.@@@The management of interests at the global level in terms of security, science and technology, as well as the management of resources in general terms, in particular of strategic raw materials and energy sources, does not yet meet the interests and expectations of the different nations and peoples of our planet.@@@It is therefore essential that we do everything in our power to continuously promote respect for, and the observance of, the values enshrined in the Charter of United Nations and in international law, so that we can correct the dangerous trajectory that the world took after the fall of the Berlin Wall.@@@In discussing contemporary problems in international relations, we highlight the importance of objectively assessing the nature and origin of conflicts and the prospects for resolving them, while always upholding the universal norms that govern relations among States.@@@We must recognize that the gap between developing and developed countries remains an unacceptable reality, because in many cases there is no real political will to overcome it, resulting in difficulties in accessing the financial and material resources that are needed to carry out development projects.@@@We must also recognize the constraints imposed on technology transfer, which are factors that delay the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set out in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@I would like to welcome the call of the Secretary-General for reform of the global financial architecture and for SDG stimulus funding to the tune of at least $500 billion dollars per year in order to tackle emerging challenges.@@@Because developing countries are not adequately represented in most global governance institutions, they are not in a position to express their sensitivities and make their points of view heard at the appropriate levels, and thereby to contribute to the formulation of realistic solutions to their problems.@@@That situation generates anxiety and frustration among the most vulnerable populations who, by not having their expectations met, become easily prone to negative influences that are dangerous to the order and stability of their respective countries.@@@Over the past decade.@@@Africa has witnessed transformations that have galvanized changes with an impact on upcoming generations.@@@Many African countries have their resolved conflicts, invested as much as they could in socioeconomic development and have promoted the education of their citizens, making them more informed and ready to contribute to the economic and social development of their respective countries.@@@Democratic transitions have become regular, and essential institutions for consolidating democracy have become more active and therefore more capable of sustaining and solidifying the democratic achievements in our nations.@@@That is a record that should be commended, and we are convinced that everything must be done to prevent a return to the models that prevailed before the advent of democracy in Africa.@@@However, the lack of economic and social prospects in many of our countries creates fertile ground for unrest and the weakening of our continent’s recent democracies.@@@It is therefore urgent and imperative that real support be given to development through financing in favourable conditions for the construction of production and distribution infrastructure and water-related infrastructure, road and railway routes, basic sanitation, the construction of schools, as well as direct private investment in African economies, so that Africa can make a greater contribution to the world economy.@@@In Africa, we have sought ways out of the current state of affairs, such as the initiative to establish the African Continental Free Trade Area, which has more than 1 billion consumers and is therefore an important platform to boost progress on the continent.@@@Africa’s international partners must believe in and invest in our market because they will surely see a satisfactory return on their investments in the different sectors of our economies in which they decide to invest.@@@We would like to meet the expectations of young Africans who are forced to try to make their dreams come true outside their continent in contexts that are almost always difficult to adapt to, in addition to the major life risks that many of them face when undertaking dangerous crossings of the Mediterranean.@@@Angola has promoted dialogue which, in our opinion, should not be limited to political and diplomatic spaces, but should also include a wide range of protagonists, including civil society organizations, companies and individuals, with a prominent place for young people, who are the real driving force behind the changes we are seeking in order to guarantee the progress of our nations.@@@It was in that spirit that Angola decided to host the Pan-African Forum for a Culture of Peace in Africa, organized in partnership with the African Union and UNESCO, whose third edition will be held in November this year in Luanda.@@@The Forum, also known as the Biennale of Luanda, is a privileged platform for exchange among different cultures, religions and social models, through interactive and constructive sessions aimed at identifying, promoting and disseminating viable and inclusive models of peaceful conflict resolution on the African continent, and can serve as a potentially inspiring reference for other regions of the world.@@@The Republic of Angola has sought to contribute its experience in terms of peacebuilding, harmony and national reconciliation to the resolution of conflicts on the African continent, with special emphasis on what is happening in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where we believe it will be possible to build a basis of trust between the belligerents, which will contribute to an easing of tension in the Great Lakes region and lead to the long-awaited peace.@@@Those efforts to contain the spread of terrorism and other destabilizing actions entail high financial costs that our countries are not always able to bear, and which can therefore jeopardize the success of the peacemaking operations that are being carried out and dash the hopes that are nurtured with regard to those processes.@@@It is therefore essential that we reaffirm the need for adequate, sustainable and predictable funding for efforts in the fight against terrorism on the continent, which is why I believe it is appropriate to renew our call to the United Nations, particularly the Security Council, for the use of fixed contributions for peacekeeping operations mandated by the African Union.@@@Until relatively recently, the Sahel region was plagued only by the actions of terrorist groups reinforced by mercenaries for hire, who, having found a power vacuum in Libya, settled there and expanded into neighbouring countries.@@@Added to that already dangerous situation, a wave of unconstitutional changes of power led by the military emerged in more or less the same region.@@@Those new powers should not be rewarded with the possibility of sharing with us the same political stages.@@@Alternatively, we will convey the wrong message that is contrary to the principles we advocate.@@@We are increasingly convinced of the existence of an invisible hand interested in destabilizing our continent, only concerned with expanding its sphere of influence, which we know will not provide the necessary support for the economic and social development of African countries.@@@The international community is concerned not only about the situation in the Sahel countries, in the Horn of Africa, in Mozambique and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, but also about the conflict in the Sudan, which, in addition to the high number of deaths, injuries and the destruction of the country’s infrastructure, has caused countless internally displaced people and refugees and has become one of the biggest humanitarian disasters the world has ever seen, the consequences of which are being felt by neighbouring countries.@@@The world must not forget the suffering of the Palestinian people, let alone ignore the need to resolve the conflict in the Middle East, especially the Israeli- Palestinian conflict, whose formula of two States living side by side peacefully has for years been found by the United Nations to not have made any progress and to lack implementation.@@@The international community runs the risk of being accused of prioritizing the conflict in Europe to the detriment of others, because they are in the Middle East and Africa, including the conflict in the Sudan which is as deadly and devastating as that of Ukraine but receives less international media coverage and less attention by the major centres of decisions on global peace and security.@@@In Europe, the war between Russia and Ukraine deserves our full attention.@@@There is an urgent need to put an immediate end to the war, given the levels of human and material destruction there, the risk of escalation into a major conflict on a global scale and the impact of its harmful effects on energy and food security.@@@All the evidence indicates that it is unlikely that there will be winners and losers on the battlefield, which is why the parties concerned should be encouraged to prioritize dialogue and diplomacy as soon as possible, to establish a ceasefire and to negotiate a lasting peace — not only for the warring countries, but to guarantee Europe’s security and contribute to world peace and security.@@@In the past three years, we have faced a major global challenge posed by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, which has demonstrated the importance and strength of solidarity among nations as a basis for tackling and solving major global problems.@@@This example should serve as a paradigm for our behaviour in facing other challenges, especially those relating to the fight against poverty and the disparities between developing and developed countries in the field of science and technology, which, as we all know, are critical factors for boosting the development and well-being of the peoples of our planet.@@@Coordination among all the world’s nations, which has been the keynote in the process of combating COVID-19, has highlighted the central role of multilateral institutions.@@@We therefore believe that pluralism in international relations is the main guarantee of the effectiveness of the actions we take to resolve the major issues affecting humankind today.@@@It is clear that, from the point of view of multilateralism, the United Nations needs to be empowered to play an effective role in fulfilling its duties and that there is an urgent need to reform the Security Council so that it reflects the reality of the times, which is totally and profoundly different from that experienced immediately after the end of the Second World War.@@@The Republic of Angola therefore defends the need to review the representation of the different regions of the world on the Security Council.@@@In this area, as far as the African continent is concerned, we defend the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration, which establish the need for Africa to be granted permanent membership of the Security Council, with all the privileges inherent in that category.@@@For decades, the United Nations has been dealing with a series of situations in which it has adopted a series of resolutions that are simply ignored and disrespected, without any consequences for those involved.@@@I think we need to reflect together on the need to try to create mechanisms to strengthen the Organization’s authority so that we do not discredit it or weaken its decisive role in building an effective world peace and security architecture, to which all the world’s nations must feel bound with a strong sense of commitment, regardless of their economic and military power.@@@It is therefore appropriate to emphasize the importance of complying with the current resolutions on the embargo against Cuba and the decades-long conflict in the Middle East between Israel and Palestine.@@@It is important to remember that in 2021.1 took part in a Security Council meeting in this city (see S/PV.8802) to discuss the issue of lifting the arms embargo on the Central African Republic.@@@Since then, there has been no progress on that issue, which seriously affects the exercise of a fundamental right of countries to have their own national army to guarantee the defence of independence, sovereignty and the normal functioning of the country’s institutions.@@@Once again.@@@I would like to reiterate the relevance of putting that issue on the agenda 
of the Security Council, so that a decision can be taken that will allow the Central African Republic to fully assume its role as an independent and sovereign State, without having to resort to hiring foreign paramilitary forces for an indefinite period of time.@@@The Republic of Angola is chairing the Organization of African.@@@Caribbean and Pacific States (OEACP) Summit of Heads of State and Government, which gives us the responsibility to address some aspects of that organization.@@@The negotiation of the partnership agreement between the OEACP and the European Union was successfully concluded, and the signing ceremony is expected to take place soon, thus marking a new phase in that cooperation, adapted to the current reality and the aspirations of the member States of both organizations.@@@This important instrument, which will be the basis of cooperation between the OEACP and the European Union, lays the foundation for actions in a wide range of areas, with a particular focus on environmental sustainability and climate change, human and social development and migration and mobility.@@@The OEACP comprises 79 countries from three continents and three oceans, representing enormous potential for cooperation for those who establish partnerships in priority areas for the member States, thus generating reciprocal benefits.@@@I would like to take this opportunity to appeal to investors to look to the OEACP countries as a safe destination with important advantages for their business.@@@I would also like to take this opportunity to speak briefly about the issue of climate change, which is currently a central concern for humankind.@@@Governments and societies in all our countries.@@@The international community must do its utmost to fulfil the promises made at the two most recent Conferences of the Parties on climate finance, so that at the twenty-eighth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change summit, to be held in the United Arab Emirates, that issue no longer takes up a significant part of the agenda and we can focus concretely on the need to urgently implement the measures to be taken to reduce polluting gases, deforestation and global warming and, thus, save our planet Earth while there is still time.@@@Allow me to take this opportunity, on behalf of the Angolan Government and people, to express our deepest sympathy to the authorities and the people of Morocco and Libya for the sudden loss of thousands of human lives and valuable national heritage as a result of natural disasters.@@@We express our total solidarity with the families and loved ones who feel the pain of the irreparable loss of loved ones.@@@I am bringing to this Assembly the voice of the South, the voice of the “exploited and scorned” — the words of Ernesto Che Guevara in this same Hall almost 60 years ago (see A/PV.1299).@@@We are diverse peoples with the same problems.@@@We just confirmed that recently in Havana, which was honoured to host a summit of leaders and other high representatives of the Group of 77 (G77) and China, the most representative, broad and diverse group in the multilateral arena.@@@During those two virtually non-stop days, more than 100 representatives from the 134 nations that comprise the Group raised their voices to call for changes that can no longer be postponed amid the unjust, irrational and abusive international economic order that, year after year, has deepened the enormous inequalities between a minority of very developed nations and a majority that has not managed to shed the euphemism of “developing nations”.@@@Worse still, as recognized by the Secretary-General at the Havana Summit, the G77 was founded six decades ago to repair centuries of injustice and abandonment and, in today’s convulsive world, they are entangled in a host of world crises, where poverty is on the rise and hunger is ever-growing.@@@We are brought together by the need to change that which remains unresolved and by the condition of being the main victims of the current global multidimensional crisis, the abusive unequal exchange, the scientific and technical gap and the degradation of the environment.@@@But we have also been brought together, for more than half a century now, by the inescapable challenge and the determination to transform the current international order, which is exclusionary, irrational, unsustainable for the planet and non-viable for the well-being of all.@@@The countries represented in the G77 and China, where 80 per cent of the global population lives, face not only the challenge of development, but also the responsibility to modify the structures that marginalize us from global progress and turn many peoples of the South into laboratories of renewed forms of domination.@@@A new and more just global contract is urgently needed.@@@Only seven years ahead of the deadline set for the implementation of the promising 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the panorama is discouraging.@@@This institution has already recognized that.@@@At the current pace, none of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals will be achieved and more than half of the 169 agreed targets will not be met.@@@In the midst of the twenty-first century, it shocks the human conscience that almost 800 million persons suffer from hunger in a planet that produces enough to feed everyone and that, in the era of knowledge and accelerated development of information and communication technologies, more than 760 million persons — two thirds women — do not know how to read or write.@@@The efforts of developing countries are not enough to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@They must be supported by concrete actions to provide access to markets, financing under fair and preferential conditions, technology transfer and North-South cooperation.@@@We are not begging for alms or favours.@@@The G77 clamours for rights and will continue to demand a profound transformation of the current international financial architecture because it is deeply unjust, anachronistic and dysfunctional and because it was designed to profit from the reserves of the South and perpetuate a system of domination that increases underdevelopment and replicates a pattern of modern colonialism.@@@We need and demand financial institutions in which our countries can have real decision-making capacity and access to financing.@@@We urgently need a recapitalization of multilateral development banks in order to radically improve their lending conditions and meet the financial needs of the South.@@@The member countries of this Group were forced to allocate $379 billion from their reserves to protect their currencies in 2022, almost twice as much the amount of special drawing rights allocated by the International Monetary Fund.@@@A streamlining, review and change of the role of credit rating agencies is needed.@@@It is also critical to establish criteria beyond gross domestic product to define the access of developing countries to financing under favourable conditions and to adequate technical cooperation.@@@While the richest countries fail to meet the commitment to allocate at least 0.7 per cent of their gross national income to official development assistance, the nations of the South need to spend up to 14 per cent of their income to service their foreign debt.@@@Most G77 nations are forced to allocate more resources to servicing the debt than to investing in health or education.@@@What sustainable development can be achieved with that noose on their necks?@@@The Group reiterates today its call on public, multilateral and private creditors to refinance the debt with credit guarantees, lower interests and longer maturities.@@@We insist on the implementation of a multilateral mechanism to renegotiate sovereign debt, with the effective participation of the countries of the South, that will allow for a fair, balanced and development-oriented treatment.@@@It is imperative to redesign, once and for all, the debt instruments and to include activation provisions to alleviate and restructure said debt whenever a country is affected by natural catastrophes or macroeconomic shocks — problems that are so common among the most vulnerable nations.@@@No one in their right mind is denying now that climate change is threatening the survival of all, with irreversible effects.@@@It is also no secret that those who are least responsible for climate change are the ones suffering the most from its effects, particularly small island developing States.@@@Meanwhile, industrialized countries, voracious predators of resources and the environment, elude their greatest responsibility and fail to comply with their commitments under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement.@@@To mention just one example, it is extremely disappointing that the goal of mobilizing no less than $100 billion a year until 2020, for climate financing, has never once been met.@@@On the eve of the twenty-eighth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP28), the G77 countries will need to prioritize the exercise of a global balance, the implementation of the Loss and Damage Fund, the definition of the framework for the adaptation goal and the establishment of a new climate financing goal, fully abiding by the principle of shared but differentiated responsibilities.@@@The G77 is organizing a summit of the leaders of the South, to be held on 2 December, in the context of COP28 in Dubai.@@@That initiative, unprecedented in the context of a Conference of the Parties, will provide a forum in which to articulate the positions of our Group at the highest level in the context of the climate negotiations.@@@COP28 will demonstrate whether, beyond the speeches, there is a real political will on the part of developed nations to achieve the urgent agreements required on this issue.@@@The priority of the G77 is to shift, once and for all, the paradigms of science, technology and innovation, which are limited to the environment and perspectives of the North, thus depriving the international scientific community of considerable intellectual capital.@@@The successful Havana summit launched an urgent appeal to centre science, technology and innovation around the indispensable objective of sustainable development.@@@At the summit, we decided to resume the work of the Consortium on Science.@@@Technology and Innovation for the South in order to promote joint research projects and foster productive linkages aimed at reducing dependence on Northern markets.@@@We also agreed to promote the convening, in 2025, of a high-level meeting of the General Assembly on science, technology and innovation for development.@@@The 17 cooperation projects that Cuba has set up in the context of its chairmanship of the G77 will contribute to channelling the potential for South South and triangular cooperation.@@@We urge the richest nations and international organizations to participate in those initiatives.@@@Cuba will not relent in its efforts to boost the creative potential, influence and leadership of the G77.@@@Our Group has much to contribute to the multilateralism, stability, justice and rationality that the world requires today.@@@In addition to all the problems and challenges of the realities of our nations and which are mobilizing peoples, there are unilateral coercive measures — euphemistically called sanctions — which have become a practice of powerful States purporting to act as universal judges to weaken and destroy economies and isolate and subjugate sovereign States.@@@Cuba is not the first sovereign State against which measures of that nature have been applied, but it is the one that has endured them the longest.@@@That is despite the worldwide condemnation of them expressed almost unanimously every year in the Assembly, which is intentionally disrespected and ignored by the Government of the biggest economic, financial and military Power in the world.@@@We were not the first, and we will not the last.@@@The pressures to isolate and weaken economies and sovereign States are also currently affecting Venezuela and Nicaragua, and, both before and after those cases, they have been the prelude to invasions and the overthrowing of inconvenient Governments in the Middle East.@@@We reject the unilateral coercive measures imposed on countries such as Zimbabwe.@@@Syria, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and Iran, among many others, whose peoples suffer the negative impact of those measures.@@@We reiterate our solidarity with the cause of the Palestinian people.@@@We support the right to self-determination of the Saharan people.@@@Let us strive for a world of peace, without wars or conflicts.@@@Five years ago.@@@I spoke for the first time from this rostrum (see A/73/PV.8), where once stood the historic leader of the Cuban revolution.@@@Commander-in-Chief Fidel Castro Ruz, and Army General Raul Castro Ruz, to speak these truths and the ideals of peace and justice of a small archipelago that has resisted and will continue to resist, reflecting the dignity, courage and unwavering resolve of its people and history.@@@But I cannot stand in this global platform without once again denouncing the fact that for 60 years now.@@@Cuba has been suffering a suffocating economic blockade designed to depress its income and living standards, inflict continuous shortages of food, medicines and other basic supplies and restrict its development potential.@@@That is the nature and those are the objectives of the policy of economic coercion and maximum pressure applied by the Government of the United States against Cuba, in violation of international law and the Charter of the United Nations.@@@Cuba has not implemented a single measure or action aimed at harming the United States through damage to its economic sector, trade or social fabric.@@@Cuba has not engaged in any action to threaten the independence or national security of the United States or to impair its sovereign rights, interfere in its internal affairs or affect its people’s well-being.@@@The behaviour of the United States is absolutely unilateral and unjustified.@@@Every day, the Cuban people use creative ways to resist and overcome that merciless economic war which, since 2019, at the height of the coronavirus disease pandemic, has been escalated opportunistically to reach an even more extreme, cruel and inhumane dimension.@@@Its effects have been brutal.@@@The United States Government pressured entities not to supply the medical oxygen and pulmonary ventilators that were needed in Cuba to face the peak of the pandemic.@@@Our Cuban scientists created the vaccines and developed the pulmonary ventilators needed save our country, and we also made them available to other countries in the world.@@@With surgical and vicious precision.@@@Washington and Florida calculated how to inflict the greatest possible damage on Cuban families.@@@The United States has tried and continues to try to prevent the supply of fuel and lubricants to our country, an action that would seem unthinkable in peacetime.@@@In a globalized world, it is not only absurd but criminal to prohibit access to technologies, including medical equipment for which more than 10 per cent of the components are from the United States.@@@The United States actions against the medical cooperation provided by Cuba in many nations are shameful.@@@It has gone so far as to openly threaten sovereign Governments that have requested such help to respond to the public health needs of their populations.@@@The United States deprives its citizens of the right to travel to Cuba, in defiance of its own Constitution.@@@The tightening of the blockade has contributed to an increase in migratory flows registered in our country in recent years, which imposes a painful cost on Cuban families and has adverse demographic and economic consequences for the nation.@@@The Government of the United States lies and does enormous damage to the international efforts to combat terrorism when it accuses Cuba, without any basis whatsoever, of being a sponsor of that scourge.@@@Under the cover of that arbitrary and fraudulent accusation, it extorts hundreds of banking and financial institutions all over the world, forcing them to choose between continuing their relations with the United States or maintaining their ties with Cuba.@@@Our country is suffering a real siege — an extraterritorial, cruel and silent economic war — one that is supported by a powerful political machinery of destabilization, with billions of dollars in funds approved by the United States Congress, aimed at capitalizing on the shortages caused by the blockade and undermining the constitutional order of the country and the peace of our citizens.@@@Despite the hostility of the United States Government, we will continue to build bridges with the country’s people, as we do with all the peoples of the world.@@@We will continue to strengthen relations with Cuban emigrants in every corner of the planet.@@@The promotion and protection of human rights is a common ideal that requires a genuine spirit of respect and constructive dialogue among States.@@@Unfortunately.@@@75 years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the reality is very different.@@@That issue has become a political weapon of powerful nations that seek to subject independent nations, mainly in the South, to their geopolitical designs.@@@No country is exempt from challenges, just as no country has the authority to designate itself as a model for human rights or to stigmatize other models, cultures or sovereign States.@@@We support dialogue and cooperation as effective ways to ensure the promotion and protection of human rights, without politicization or selectivity and without the application of double standards, conditions or pressure.@@@In that spirit.@@@Cuba submitted its candidacy to the Human Rights Council for the period 2024-2026 in the elections that will be held on 10 October.@@@We would like to thank in advance for their trust those countries that have already given us their valuable support.@@@If elected.@@@Cuba will continue to raise its voice for a universal vision, representative of the South and in favour of the legitimate interests of developing countries, based on a constructive commitment to, and unwavering responsibility for, the full realization of all human rights for all.@@@Cuba will continue to strengthen its democracy and its socialist model, which even under siege has shown how much a developing country — small in size and with modest natural wealth — can do.@@@We will continue our transformative process, seeking ways out of the siege imposed on us by United States imperialism and ways to achieve the prosperity with social justice that our people deserve.@@@In that endeavour, we will never give up the right to defend ourselves.@@@I wish to conclude by extending an invitation to everyone to work to overcome differences and to face common challenges together and with a sense of urgency.@@@To achieve that, the United Nations and the General Assembly, even with their limitations, are the most powerful instruments at our disposal.@@@Cuba can always be counted on to defend multilateralism and to jointly promote peace and sustainable development for all.@@@It will always be an honour to fight for justice, sharing the difficulties and challenges with the people of the South that are willing to change history.@@@And we will win.@@@I would like to greet the President of the General Assembly.@@@Ambassador Dennis Francis of Trinidad and Tobago.@@@It is also a great pleasure to be preceded by Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.@@@I acknowledge all the Heads of State and Government and representatives present.@@@I pay tribute to our compatriot Sergio Vieira de Mello and the 21 other staff members of the Organization who fell victim to the brutal attack in Baghdad 20 years ago.@@@I also would also like to express my condolences to the victims of the earthquake in Morocco and the storms that struck Libya.@@@Like the recent events in the state of Rio Grande do Sul in my country, those tragedies have claimed lives and caused irreparable losses.@@@Our thoughts and prayers are with all the victims and their families.@@@Exactly 20 years ago.@@@I stood at this rostrum for the first time and said, on 23 September 2003.@@@“Let my first words before this world parliament be of confidence in the human capacity to overcome challenges and to move towards higher forms of partnership” (A/58/PV.7, p.5).@@@I return today to say that I maintain my unshakable trust in humankind.@@@At that time, the world had not yet realized the severity of the climate crisis.@@@Today it is at our doorstep, destroying our homes, cities and countries, killing people and causes losses and suffering for our brothers, especially the poorest.@@@Hunger — the central theme of my statement at this world parliament 20 years ago — today affects 735 million human beings, who will go to sleep tonight without knowing if they will have anything to eat tomorrow.@@@The world is increasingly unequal.@@@The 10 richest billionaires have more wealth than the poorest 40 per cent of humankind.@@@The destiny of every child born on the planet seems to be decided while they are still in their mother’s womb.@@@The part of the world where their parents live and the social class to which their family belongs will determine whether or not they will have opportunities throughout their life; whether they will eat at every meal or they will be denied the right to eat breakfast, lunch and dinner every day; whether they will have access to health care or they will succumb to diseases that could have already been eradicated; whether they will finish school and get a decent job or they will be numbered among the countless unemployed, underemployed and discouraged people.@@@First of all, we must overcome our resignation, which makes us accept such unfairness as a natural phenomenon.@@@There is a lack of political on the part of those who govern the world to overcome inequality.@@@If today I have returned in the honourable capacity as President of Brazil, it is thanks to the victory won through democracy in my country.@@@Democracy ensured that we overcame hate, misinformation and oppression.@@@Hope, once again, has won over fear.@@@Our mission is to ignite Brazil and rebuild a sovereign, fair, sustainable, supportive, generous and joyful country with solidarity.@@@Brazil has once again found its place within our region, the world and multilateralism.@@@As I never tire of repeating.@@@Brazil is back.@@@Our country is back to make its rightful contributions to facing the major global challenges.@@@We have reclaimed our foreign policy’s universalism, marked by respectful dialogue with everyone.@@@The international community has been immersed in a flood of multiple and simultaneous crises.@@@The coronavirus disease pandemic, the climate crisis and food and energy insecurity have been amplified by growing geopolitical tensions.@@@Racism.@@@intolerance and xenophobia have spread, encouraged by new technologies that were created supposedly to bring us closer together.@@@If we had to summarize those challenges in a single word, it would be “inequality”.@@@Inequality is at the root of those phenomena and serves to aggravate them.@@@The United Nations broadest and most ambitious collective action aimed at development, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, could turn into its greatest failure.@@@We have reached the mid-point of the implementation period and are still far from achieving its defined goals.@@@Most of the Sustainable Development Goals are moving at a slow place.@@@The moral and political imperative of eradicating poverty and ending hunger appears to have been numbed.@@@In the seven years that we have left, reducing inequalities within and among countries should become the core objective of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@Reducing inequalities within countries requires providing for the poor in Government budgets and making the rich pay taxes that are proportional to their wealth.@@@In Brazil, we are committed to implementing all 17 Sustainable Development Goals in an integrated and indivisible manner.@@@We want to achieve racial equality in Brazilian society through an eighteenth goal, which we will voluntarily adopt.@@@We launched the Brazil zero-hunger programme, which will bring together a series of initiatives to reduce poverty and food insecurity, including the Bolsa Familia Programme, which has become a global reference for income transfer programmes for families who keep their children vaccinated and in school.@@@Inspired by Brazilian Bertha Lutz, a pioneer in and advocate for gender equality and the Charter of the United Nations, we have adopted a bill that makes equal pay between women and men mandatory when they perform the same roles.@@@We will fight femicide and all forms of violence against women.@@@We will strongly advocate for the rights of LGBTQI+ groups and people with disabilities.@@@We have revived social participatory practices as a strategic tool for implementing public policies.@@@Taking action against climate change involves thinking about tomorrow and facing historical inequalities.@@@Rich countries grew, based on a model with high rates of climate-damaging emissions.@@@The climate emergency makes it urgent to correct course and implement what has already been agreed.@@@There is no other reason why we speak of common but differentiated responsibilities.@@@It is the vulnerable populations in the global South who are most affected by the loss and damage caused by climate change.@@@The richest 10 per cent of the world’s population is responsible for almost half of all carbon that is released into the atmosphere.@@@We, the developing countries, do not want to repeat that model.@@@In Brazil, we have already proved once and will prove again that a socially fair and environmentally sustainable model is possible.@@@We are at the forefront of an energy transition, and our matrix is already one of the cleanest in the world.@@@Some 87 per cent of our electrical power comes from clean and renewable sources.@@@Solar, wind, biomass, ethanol and biodiesel power generation is growing every year.@@@The potential for generating green hydrogen is immense.@@@With the ecological transformation plan, we will invest in sustainable industrialization and sustainable infrastructure.@@@We have renewed the sound Amazon Agenda with oversight actions aimed at combating environmental crime.@@@Over the past eight months, deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon has already been reduced by 48 per cent.@@@The entire world has always talked about the Amazon, and now the Amazon is speaking for itself.@@@A month ago, we hosted the Belem Summit meeting in the heart of the Amazon and launched a new collaboration agenda among countries that are part of that biome.@@@There are 50 million South Americans living in the Amazon whose future depends on the decisive coordination and action by the countries that hold sovereignty over the region’s territories.@@@We also have continued our dialogue with other countries that have tropical forests in Africa and Asia.@@@We want to arrive at the twenty-eighth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, in Dubai, with a joint vision that reflects, without any coaching, priorities for preserving the Amazon, the Congo and Borneo-Mekong basins, based on our needs.@@@Without mobilizing financial and technological resources, there is no way to implement what we decided in the Paris Agreement and the global biodiversity framework.@@@The promise to allocate $100 billion annually to developing countries remains just that — a promise.@@@Today that amount would be insufficient for the demand, which already reaches trillions of dollars.@@@The principle on which multilateralism is based — that of the sovereign equality of nations — is being eroded.@@@At the main global governance levels. 
negotiations in which all countries have a voice and vote have lost momentum.@@@When institutions reproduce inequalities, they are part of the problem, not the solution.@@@Last year, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) made available $160 billion in special drawing rights to European countries and just $34 billion to African countries.@@@The unequal and distorted representation of the management of the IMF and the World Bank is unacceptable.@@@We have not corrected the excesses of market deregulation and support for the ideology of the minimum state.@@@The foundations of a new economic governance have not been laid.@@@The Brazil.@@@Russian Federation.@@@India.@@@China and South Africa (BRICS) group was the result of that paralysis and constitutes a strategic platform to promote cooperation among emerging countries.@@@The recent expansion of the group at the Johannesburg summit meeting strengthens the fight for an order that accommodates the economic, geographical and political plurality of the twenty-first century.@@@We are a force that works towards fairer global trade in the context of a serious crisis of multilateralism.@@@The rich countries’ protectionism has gained strength, and the World Trade Organization remains paralysed, in particular its dispute-settlement system.@@@No one remembers the Doha Development Round anymore.@@@Meanwhile, unemployment and precarious work have been undermining people’s confidence in better times, especially the youth.@@@Governments must stem the increase in dissonance between the voice of the markets and the voice of the streets.@@@Neoliberalism has aggravated the economic and political inequality that plagues democracies today.@@@Its legacy is a mass of disenfranchised and excluded people.@@@Amid the wreck, far-right adventurers emerge, who deny politics and sell solutions that are as easy as they are wrong.@@@Many have fallen to the temptation of replacing failed neoliberalism with primitive, conservative and authoritarian nationalism.@@@We reject an agenda that uses immigrants as scapegoats, undermines the welfare State and attacks workers’ rights.@@@We need to reclaim the best humanist traditions that inspired the creation of the United Nations.@@@Active inclusion policies at the cultural, educational and digital levels are fundamental for promoting democratic values and defending the rule of law.@@@Preserving press freedom is essential.@@@A journalist such as Julian Assange cannot be punished for informing society in a transparent and legitimate way.@@@Our fight is against misinformation and cybercrime.@@@Applications and platforms should not abolish the labour laws for which we fought so hard.@@@Upon assuming the presidency of the Group of 20 next December, we will spare no effort to place the fight against inequality in all its dimensions at the core of the international agenda.@@@Under the motto.@@@“Building a just world and a sustainable planet”, the Brazilian presidency will coordinate social inclusion, combat hunger and promote sustainable development and the reform of global governance institutions.@@@There will be no sustainability or prosperity without peace.@@@Armed conflicts are an offence to human rationality.@@@We know the horrors and suffering caused by all wars.@@@Promoting a culture of peace is a duty for all of us.@@@Building it requires persistence and vigilance.@@@It is disturbing to see that old, unresolved disputes persist and that new threats emerge or gain force.@@@The difficulty of guaranteeing the creation of a State for the Palestinian people clearly shows that, not to mention the persistent humanitarian crisis in Haiti, the conflict in Yemen, threats to Libyan national unity and institutional ruptures in Burkina Faso.@@@Gabon. Guinea-@@@Conakry. Mali, the Niger and the Sudan.@@@In Guatemala, there is a risk of a coup d’etat, which would prevent the winner of the democratic elections from taking office.@@@The war in Ukraine exposes our collective inability to enforce the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.@@@We do not underestimate the difficulties of achieving peace, but no solution will be lasting if it is not based on dialogue.@@@I have reiterated that work needs to be done to create space for negotiations.@@@Much is invested in weapons, and very little in development.@@@Last year, military spending totalled more than $2 trillion.@@@Expenditures on nuclear weapons reached $83 billion — a value 20 times higher than the regular United Nations budget.@@@Stability and security will not be achieved where there is social exclusion and inequality.@@@The United Nations was born to be the home of understanding and dialogue.@@@The international community must choose: on the one hand, there is the expansion of conflicts, the furthering of inequalities and the erosion of the rule of law; on the other, there is the renewal of multilateral institutions dedicated to promoting peace.@@@Unilateral sanctions cause great harm to the populations of affected countries.@@@In addition to not achieving their alleged goals, unilateral sanctions hinder mediation and prevention processes and the peaceful resolution of conflicts.@@@Brazil will continue to reject measures taken without the support of the Charter of the United Nations, such as the economic and financial embargo imposed on Cuba and the attempt to classify that country as a State sponsor of terrorism.@@@We shall continue to criticize any attempt to divide the world into zones of influence and revive the Cold War.@@@The Security Council has been progressively losing its credibility.@@@Its frailty is the specific result of the actions of its permanent members who wage unauthorized wars aimed at territorial expansion or regime change.@@@The Council’s paralysis is the most eloquent proof of the urgent need to reform it, which will bring it greater representation and efficacy.@@@Inequalities need to inspire outrage — outrage over hunger, poverty, war and disrespect for human beings.@@@Moved by the power of outrage, we may act willingly and unwaveringly in the fight against inequality and effectively transform the world around us.@@@The United Nations needs to fulfil its role as a builder of a world with greater solidarity, fraternity and fairness, but it can do so only if its members have the courage to proclaim their discontent at inequality and work tirelessly to overcome it.@@@I bring warm greetings from the people of the Federated States of Micronesia to the Assembly.@@@At the outset.@@@I congratulate Mr. Dennis Francis on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session.@@@I assure him of my and my delegation’s full support and have every confidence that he will be successful in leading the General Assembly to a successful conclusion.@@@I should also like to express our appreciation to his predecessor.@@@Mr. Csaba Korosi, for his service to the General Assembly, and to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for his bold and visionary leadership in steering the United Nations during these challenging times.@@@We have just emerged from the coronavirus disease pandemic, yet our collective challenges have not diminished; rather, we have faced a number of intersecting crises, from the adverse impacts of climate change to the decline in the health of our ocean, from sustainable development to peace and security.@@@I will briefly elaborate on them from the perspective of a Pacific small island developing State, but I also want to highlight our opportunities.@@@In 2015, the same year in which this organ adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1), the international community also adopted the landmark Paris Agreement on Climate Change.@@@Though far from perfect, the Paris Agreement represents a key tool to combat the climate crisis.@@@The adoption of the Paris Agreement marked a high point of multilateralism, similar to this organ’s adoption of the 2030 Agenda.@@@Unfortunately, the international community has not done nearly enough to get us on track to limiting the global average temperature increase to 1.5°C.@@@One need only scan the news on any random day to see the evidence of the climate crisis in devastating effects around the world today.@@@Loss and damage caused by the climate crisis are accumulating every day in Micronesia, and they will continue to worsen at a faster pace as tipping points are reached.@@@As the Secretary-General recently stated, we are now in an era of “global boiling”.@@@We need a fast-acting mandatory approach, which should be modelled on the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, the best environmental agreement ratified by every United Nations Member State.@@@We should use that work-horse treaty — the little engine that could — as a model for a new agreement to cut methane, the blowtorch pushing the planet from global warming to global boiling.@@@The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) tells us that current nationally determined contributions under the Paris Agreement, if fully implemented, will still lead to over 2°C of warming by the end of this century, with 3°C being a very distinct possibility.@@@That is an existential threat to my country and many other small island developing States.@@@And yet, major emitters, including from the developing world, have yet to commit to updating their nationally determined contributions as part of the global stocktake in order to get us on a 1.5°C track.@@@This week.@@@I joined my fellow leaders in the High Ambition Coalition on climate change in issuing a statement with a strong call for action.@@@In line with the statement.@@@Micronesia strongly implores all parties to the Paris Agreement — particularly major emitters from the developed and developing world — to commit, by the twenty-eighth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP28), to major reductions of emissions of at least half by 2030, with the peaking of emissions by 2025, and to peg their net zero goals to no later than 2050, in line with the recommendations of the IPCC.@@@As part of that effort, countries should eliminate the emissions of methane, hydrofluorocarbons and other short-lived climate pollutants from their industrial products and activities, which altogether could result in the avoidance of at least 0.5°C of global warming.@@@While Micronesia has negligible global emissions, it has bold ambitions to limit its emissions.@@@Through our nationally determine contribution strategy, by 2030 we aim to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from electricity generation by more than 65 per cent below 2000 levels.@@@By 2050.@@@Micronesia will achieve net zero.@@@That bold pledge will result in a healthier, happier and climate resilient island nation.@@@The climate crisis is indeed impacting health security, food security, water security, economic security and peace security.@@@It is without a doubt an existential threat.@@@We reiterate our call for the appointment of a special representative for climate and security to address those threats.@@@We also call for the full operationalization of the new Loss and Damage Fund at COP28 in order to equip those who are most affected by climate change to deal with the ongoing loss and damage impacts that are faced every day.@@@It is time for those most responsible for climate change to put their money where their mouth is, for the cost of not doing so is far greater than what could ever be quantified.@@@Additionally.@@@Micronesia is proud to announce that we have recently adopted an amendment to our national constitution that recognizes the right of our people to a healthy environment.@@@As custodians of our natural heritage, we adopted the amendment in part to underscore that this right is a general principle of international law applicable to all States, including major contributors to the climate crisis.@@@We need all available tools to fight the climate crisis, including those provided to us under international law.@@@For that reason.@@@Micronesia is proud to have been a member of the core group of countries that advocated for the adoption by this organ of a resolution requesting an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice on the obligations of States and consequences under international law in relation to climate change.@@@Countries like mine and people like mine are the front lines of climate change, but we do not need more promises.@@@What we need now is action for promises to turn into policy and for policy to turn into proactive steps towards real solutions.@@@As islanders, resilience is in our DNA, but let me recall that our resilience should not be a placeholder for continued inaction.@@@As a Big Ocean State, we recognize one clear truth — the ocean is suffering from multiple stressors.@@@It is the duty of the international community to address the sources of those stressors for the sake of present and future generations of humankind, as well as for the sake of the ocean itself.@@@Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 14 would not have been included in the 2030 Agenda if not for the sustained advocacy of Micronesia and other small island developing States, particularly from the Pacific.@@@By the same token, the recent adoption of the agreement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction (BBNJ) would not have been possible without the key contributions of Pacific small island developing States like Micronesia.@@@Just as Micronesia actively engaged in the negotiation of the BBNJ agreement, it is also committed to implementing it.@@@That is why I am honoured to have been the first Head of State to sign the BBNJ agreement, which I did yesterday on behalf of Micronesia.@@@I urge Members of the United Nations and other world leaders to sign and ratify the agreement, and also urge the full implementation of SDG 14 as soon as possible.@@@We also commit to doing our part in implementing the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, including with respect to the establishment of marine protected areas and similar measures for at least 30 per cent of the global ocean by 2030.@@@Our work on the Micronesia Challenge.@@@Blue Prosperity Micronesia and similar initiatives in our part of the world already contribute to that effort.@@@The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is at its halfway point.@@@We are not on track on a number of issues.@@@I have already pronounced myself in more detail at the SDG Summit.@@@But we also have opportunities.@@@We have just completed preparatory meetings for the fourth International Conference on SIDS.@@@We expect the outcome of the Conference to be concise and action-oriented, yet to address our most pressing needs in partnership with the international community, including how internet connectivity can change life in the islands by making telemedicine and remote learning available at every outlying island, and how transportation can be more sustainable if one’s only means of transport are boats.@@@It is my hope that practical action will flow from the Conference, including to support the implementation of the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent.@@@Micronesia is a proud matrilineal society, where our clans, lineage and land control are mainly passed down from generation to generation through women.@@@That symbolizes the powerful role of women in our culture and society.@@@Yet we recognize that, historically, women have had difficulty in attaining roles in leadership and decision-making in Government.@@@I am therefore pleased to report that finally, finally, there are women members currently serving in our national congress.@@@In my own administration.@@@I am committed to putting more women into leadership and decision-making positions while continuing to meaningfully consult and engage women 
on matters of national importance, in order to strive for a more inclusive and equal Micronesia.@@@Traditional threats to peace and security persist, making the principles of the United Nations all the more valuable to uphold.@@@That is why Micronesia stands in solidarity with Ukraine and supports its independence within its internationally recognized borders.@@@We also urge all Member States to cooperate to urgently address the adverse impacts of the war in Ukraine on food security, energy and finance, including in small island developing States like my own, which are vulnerable to such impacts.@@@We must find ways to put an end to that illegal war, which continues to erode the credibility and integrity of this premier international body and the principles enshrined in its Charter we all agree to support.@@@That brings me to a related and most crucial point—the reform of the Security Council, which was put in place almost 80 years ago.@@@The Security Council has become archaic and ineffective in addressing security challenges of our contemporary world, which are much more complicated, interlocking and interconnected, including the worsening and devastating impacts of climate change.@@@As the Secretary-General mentioned in his opening statement.@@@“The world has changed.@@@Our institutions have not” (A/78/PV.4, p.l).@@@The time for that change is now.@@@The geopolitical dynamics that we face demand that we embrace change and adapt to the realities and dynamics of the twenty-first century.@@@Permanent membership of the Security Council must be expanded to include Japan.@@@India.@@@Germany and others; and non-permanent membership should be expanded as well, including a stand-alone seat for small island developing States.@@@Those changes are needed in order to enhance the legitimacy, credibility and effectiveness of the Council.@@@The time for Security Council reform is now.@@@In conclusion, more than ever in the history of the United Nations, we urgently need to live up to our name and to fortify unity among nations, for the challenges of our time demand it of us.@@@Our global community is interconnected and interdependence among nations is reality.@@@And so, no challenge can be solved by any one country or community alone.@@@We must admit that we all need each other.@@@And so, in addressing those challenges, we must remember that people lie at the heart of every solution, both as a driver and as a benefactor.@@@As a global community, we all gather here within these walls because, despite it all, we still believe that we can do better.@@@We still have the audacity to reimagine a more just, safe and prosperous world that is worthy of the next generation.@@@It gives me great pleasure to stand before the General Assembly on this historic rostrum to participate in the Assembly’s seventy-eighth session.@@@I would like to express our heartfelt congratulations to the President of the General Assembly, as well as the State of Trinidad and Tobago, on his election.@@@I assure him of Somalia’s full readiness to work with him as he undertakes his responsibilities.@@@I would also like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation to his predecessor.@@@Mr. Csaba Korosi, for his successful leadership of the previous session.@@@Given the theme of this year’s session “Rebuilding trust and reigniting global solidarity: accelerating action on the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals towards peace, prosperity, progress and sustainability for all”.@@@I would like to recall a Somali proverb: “to be without knowledge is to be without light”.@@@Somalia is a country that has been blessed by God with resilient people who have great and countless abilities.@@@We clearly see the great contradictions between the promise on the ground and the harsh realities and challenges that we face.@@@Therefore.@@@I stand before the Assembly today to bear witness to the dire consequences of inaction.@@@I realize what inaction means for ordinary innocent people in terms of failing to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).@@@As we stand at the halfway point of the implementation of the SDGs, we must be able to scale up and accelerate our actions.@@@The time for complacency has passed.@@@Future generations are looking to us as leaders.@@@States and institutions, to enhance efforts to find innovative solutions to our problems and crises and to create effective partnerships that will transform promises into policies and commitments and tangible measures.@@@We must fully honour our moral responsibility not to leave anyone behind.@@@That is the best way to ensure that everyone lives in peace, prosperity, progress and sustainable development.@@@The coronavirus disease pandemic exposed the fragility of our interconnected world, but it also showed the power of solidarity and cooperation during difficult times.@@@That painful experience has demonstrated gaps in mobilizing resources and in preparedness and pandemic prevention mechanisms, which requires an 
urgent response to international emergencies.@@@We must therefore adopt an approach that includes the whole of society.@@@In that regard, we call for the establishment of platforms to coordinate policies at the global and regional levels and to collect resources and expertise, with a view to enhancing measures to protect against pandemics and maintain readiness.@@@Those platforms must adopt an approach that realizes equality and the SDGs as essential principles for enhancing our collective ability to detect, respond to and recover from shocks while promoting global solidarity.@@@The differences and inequalities in the ability to mobilize resources during the pandemic demonstrate the need to restructure the global financial order, which has become more urgent than ever before.@@@We live in one interconnected world, whose peoples have the same aspirations and challenges.@@@Therefore, we must urgently adopt a financial system that is capable of changing those tangible and painful realities.@@@The time has come to leave behind obsolete structures, remedy historic ills and build a financial order that is in line with the values of joint prosperity and collective progress.@@@We can plant the seeds of stability and progress only in a land that is nourished by the principles of consultation and inclusiveness.@@@Today our world faces unprecedented challenges as we witness a dangerously increase in violence.@@@We see that new technologies, such as artificial intelligence, pose new and terrifying threats to all of us.@@@The noticeable increase in armed conflicts and military coups, especially on the African continent, is a source of deep concern, because those conflicts have a devastating impact on the lives of civilians and lead to a significantly increase in displacement and poverty.@@@Those are all issues from which Somalia is still struggling to recover.@@@In the light of the most recent international incidents, which recall our painful past, we call for an immediate and comprehensive cessation of violence and destruction.@@@We call for adherence to democratic principles and the protection of constitutional systems that guarantee civil liberties.@@@In an era of increasing hatred and violence.@@@Somalia remains guided by the principles of noble Islam.@@@We remain firm advocates for the principles of tolerance among the different faiths and enhancing mutual understanding.@@@We clearly and unequivocally condemn the racial discrimination and oppression that targets Muslim communities in many areas of the world.@@@We firmly believe that we cannot achieve global harmony except through diversity and the eradication of bigotry.@@@The question of Palestine, which remains intractable, continues to be a source of shame to us all.@@@We reaffirm that Somalia will continue to defend the inalienable rights and self-determination of the brotherly Palestinian people.@@@We also reiterate our call for a just two-State solution that respects the 1967 borders.@@@Our solidarity with Palestine is a true testament of our steadfast commitment to justice and protection of human rights.@@@Somalia welcomes the New Agenda for Peace proposed by Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, because it reminds us that conflicts arise from problems of inequality.@@@We completely agree with the need to make every effort to remedy the root causes of conflicts through comprehensive development, dialogue and the protection of human rights.@@@We live in an international system that is both fragmented and unequal.@@@Therefore.@@@I call on my fellow Heads of State and Government to work together to reform multilateral institutions, such as the United Nations, development banks and the Security Council, because those institutions with their current structures are no longer fit for addressing the challenges that we face today.@@@We must all work together to implement a collective agenda that will make those institutions more inclusive, transparent, accountable and fit for their purposes, goals and objectives.@@@The Summit of the Future, convened by the Secretary-General, provides a rare opportunity to address those shared objectives.@@@We call on everyone to ensure that peace, justice and the rule of law prevail, thereby laying the foundations for a world in which conflicts are resolved through diplomacy and peaceful means.@@@Climate change constitutes an existential challenge to all humankind.@@@It is a challenge that transcends barriers and will not respond to isolated efforts, and can be addressed only through united resolve.@@@Extreme weather events, the increase in temperature and the raging forest fires that are ravaging communities in an unexpected and often unpredictable manner are all real reminders that the consequences of failing to take responsible collective action are no longer a distant concern.@@@In recent years.@@@Somalia has been caught in a vicious cycle of long droughts and devastating floods that have claimed thousands of lives and dispersed millions.@@@It is extremely unjust that Somalia, the country that has contributed the least to global carbon 
emissions, has had to bear the brunt of the adverse impacts of climate change.@@@From this rostrum, we call on the international community to support us in addressing that urgent issue and bolstering our resilience in confronting climate change.@@@There is no country poorer than Somalia, when compared to its situation in the 1960s.@@@Nevertheless, over the past decade.@@@Somalia has achieved remarkable progress towards peace and stability, and we have begun to see tangible socioeconomic growth.@@@The principle of a Somalia living in peace with itself and its neighbours is the cornerstone of our Government’s foreign policy as it works towards peaceful coexistence and effective cooperation with our neighbours and partners to achieve shared prosperity.@@@At the local level, we have adopted a conciliatory approach with a view to reaching political settlements and promoting lasting cohesion within our society.@@@We have used a firm hand in uprooting and eliminating extremism.@@@Our recent campaign against terrorism has achieved a quantum leap against terrorists at the military, financial and ideological levels, with 45 per cent of regions previously occupied by the terrorist group Al-Shabaab being liberated in less than one year.@@@Thanks to our efforts over the past year and our effective commitment, resolve and cooperation with our partners and local communities, there will not be a single rock left for terrorists to hide under.@@@We therefore call for a similar approach to be taken to eradicating international terrorism and for the effective integration of local communities and the protection of their rights through the enforcement of justice and the rule of law.@@@In that regard.@@@I take the opportunity to commend the courage and sacrifices of the African Union Transition Mission in Somalia (ATMIS).@@@We also thank troop contributing countries and all our partners and allies for their fraternal support.@@@Somalia is committed to fully implementing the security transition plan and assuming full responsibility for security once the African ATMIS troops have withdrawn from the country by the end of 2024.@@@In that context.@@@I would like to reiterate Somalia’s call for the full and unconditional lifting of the arms embargo imposed by the Security Council in 1992, which is the longest-running and most expansive embargo of different kinds of arms in the world.@@@Today Somalia has stronger administrative systems in place to regulate the possession, use and storage of firearms.@@@Lifting the embargo will enable us to effectively address terrorism and build a future marked by peace and prosperity for our people.@@@Somalia looks forward to a fruitful and bright future.@@@To that end, we need to take three critical steps.@@@First, we need to fulfil the requirements of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative.@@@We have successfully reached the decision point under the Initiative.@@@We expect to reach the completion point by the end of this year, paving the way for alleviating the debt burden on Somalia and unleashing its vital resources to achieve autonomous growth.@@@Secondly, we need to put the era of the Al-Shabaab terrorist movement behind us.@@@As we continue to wage our robust campaign against terrorism, we are optimistic about the limitless opportunities to achieve socioeconomic progress in a country free of security threats.@@@Thirdly, we need to reach the post-ATMIS period.@@@The withdrawal of foreign troops and the assumption by Somali troops of full responsibility for national security constitute an important step towards restoring our sovereignty, re-establishing our social compact with our people and promoting a peaceful and cohesive society.@@@We stand ready to rejoin the international community as an active and productive partner.@@@We call on the international community to join us in that process and to be a part of our success.@@@In conclusion.@@@Somalia is a beautiful country, rich in human and natural capital.@@@Our doors are wide open to any cooperative effort to invest in its varied capacities and achieve prosperity for everyone.@@@An investment in Somalia is an investment in the future.@@@I congratulate Mr. Francis on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session.@@@I wish him success in assuming that task, and I assure him of the support of the delegation of Lebanon for the visionary programme of work that he has set for the upcoming year.@@@This year marks the eightieth anniversary of Lebanon’s independence, eight decades during which Lebanon has been striving to merit its place among peace-loving and prosperous nations.@@@Lebanon was among the founders of this international Organization in which we meet today and significantly contributed to the drafting of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.@@@However.@@@Lebanon’s journey was not an easy one.@@@In addition to the bright stages of its history in terms of stability, growth, prosperity and peace-building.@@@Lebanon has also lived through long and very dangerous and difficult phases, during which it witnessed conflicts on its land and in neighbouring areas, along with wars of aggression against it, resulting in a prolonged occupation of dear parts of Lebanon’s territory, accompanied by two refugee and displacement crises and an unprecedented economic, financial and humanitarian crisis.@@@Today Lebanon faces many overlapping crises against the backdrop of a weakened international system and a regional climate full of tensions and challenges, which weigh heavily on the Lebanese people, who suffer daily from the lack of basic moral and material elements that enable them to survive, in addition to the brain and youth drain and the receding flicker of hope in the eyes of many Lebanese men and women.@@@The first challenge is of course the vacant presidency of the Republic and the inability to elect a new President of the country.@@@That has led to institutional and political instability, the exacerbation of the economic and financial crises and the failure of the reform plans and economic and financial recovery on which the Lebanese are counting to save the country from the difficult conditions.@@@I sincerely look forward to the Lebanese Parliament exercising its sovereign role by electing a President of the Republic in the upcoming period, a President around whom the Lebanese are united and who enshrines the return of the Republic through the country’s presidency and constitutional institutions and Lebanon’s return to fulfilling its mission and playing its leading role, in close cooperation with our Arab brothers and friends in the international community.@@@In that regard.@@@I commend the role played by the committee of five, as well as the French initiative aimed at helping to achieve that constitutional milestone.@@@Twelve years have passed since the Syrian crisis began, and Lebanon is still bearing the burden of successive waves of displacement, the economic and social repercussions of which have affected all aspects of its life, thereby threatening its very existence.@@@Despite voicing our concerns in all international forums and in this very forum, the international community’s response to the consequences of that human tragedy and its repercussions for us remains extremely shameful and fails to address it effectively and sustainably.@@@From this rostrum.@@@I once again warn of the negative repercussions of displacement, which deepen Lebanon’s crises.@@@However.@@@Lebanon will not be the only victim.@@@I repeat that Lebanon will not be the only victim.@@@I also reiterate the call for the development of a road map, in cooperation with all international stakeholders, to find sustainable solutions to the Syrian displacement crisis before its repercussions spiral out of control.@@@In that regard.@@@I would like to mention a positive development in terms of the agreement reached by Lebanon with the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees on the exchange of information regarding the Syrian presence in Lebanon.@@@We stress Lebanon’s commitment to deepening cooperation with international institutions and United Nations organizations as a cornerstone of the sustainable solution that we seek.@@@The third challenge is Israel’s continued occupation of parts of our land in the south, its daily attacks and violations of Lebanese sovereignty and violation of its obligations under Security Council resolution 1701 (2006).@@@Lebanon affirms its full commitment to all the provisions of that resolution and its respect for all other relevant Security Council resolutions.@@@I take this opportunity to thank all the troop-contributing countries participating in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, the mandate of which was renewed by the Security Council at the end of August.@@@The mission entrusted to that United Nations force cannot be accomplished without close cooperation and ongoing coordination with the Lebanese army.@@@That would help to consolidate peace and security in the region and to restore the authority of the Lebanese State throughout its territory within its internationally recognized borders.@@@Let me place on record Lebanon’s satisfaction with the start of oil and gas exploration in its territorial waters and its desire to play a constructive energy role in the Mediterranean basin in the future.@@@Parts of the Middle East region are witnessing worrisome levels of political and security instability, which cast a shadow over the countries and peoples of the region.@@@However, it is worth noting that there are striking exceptions of stability, development, growth and building a future in the Arab Gulf countries.@@@Those countries and their peoples are dear to our hearts.@@@Lebanon owes them a great deal of gratitude and appreciation.@@@In that context, we welcome the return of the Syrian Arab Republic to its membership in the League of Arab States and the Saudi-Iranian agreement.@@@Meanwhile, the brotherly Palestinian people continue to languish under occupation and to struggle to achieve their inalienable human rights.@@@With the growing need to alleviate the suffering of the Palestinian people, we reaffirm our commitment to a just and comprehensive peace, based on the two-State solution and international parameters, in particular Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973).@@@Today I take this opportunity to recall the Arab Peace Initiative, adopted at the Beirut summit in 2002, which laid the foundations for the desired peace.@@@In that context, and as a country that has hosted hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees since 1948.@@@Lebanon would like to once again remind the international community of its humanitarian and moral responsibility towards the Palestinian refugees, and we call for full support to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East to enable it to continue to carry out its tasks, pending a final solution.@@@We have always said that the world is witnessing cross-border challenges that require greater coordination and cooperation among countries, from climate change and viral pandemics to security, food security, cybersecurity, illegal migration, extremism and terrorism, to name but a few.@@@There are many challenges of a global nature that can be met only through the concerted efforts of Governments, international organizations and civil society organizations.@@@In that regard, we would like to express our solidarity with the Libyan and Moroccan peoples in the aftermath of the natural disasters that struck the two brotherly countries.@@@International cooperation, based on the principles of partnership and inclusiveness, has become a sine qua non for the security, safety and well-being of peoples.@@@The United Nations and its specialized agencies are at the heart of that international effort, guiding and supporting it with standards and tools.@@@In the light of the challenges facing Lebanon at the national level, and despite the regional tensions and their adverse effects in various areas, my country is keen to continue to play the role expected of it at the regional and international levels.@@@Despite the current situation.@@@Lebanon has sought to continue to implement the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.@@@It also actively participated in the twenty-seventh session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP27), held in Sharm El-Sheikh, the Arab Republic of Egypt, and looks forward to the same level of active participation in the COP28 climate conference, to be held in Dubai.@@@We wish that brotherly host country and the conference every success.@@@I would like to take this opportunity to stress the importance of a sovereign and independent Lebanese State that is strong, capable and inclusive and cooperates 
with the international community and friendly and brotherly countries; a Lebanese State that protects the parliamentary democratic system and public and private freedoms and engages in structural reforms and in strengthening the rule of law, citizenship, accountability and justice; a Lebanese State that believes in tolerance and brotherly relations and that adopts a policy of dissociation and stays away from the policy of axes; and a Lebanese State as an urgent need for security, peace, stability and prosperity in the region.@@@That is the best way for all of us to keep pace with the changes, mitigate the negative repercussions, build the future and face the challenges of poverty, unemployment, the brain drain, extremism and terrorism, thereby avoiding the unknown.@@@Finally.@@@I would like to conclude by recalling the pillars laid by the President as his vision to lead the General Assembly at its current session.@@@Peace, prosperity, progress and sustainability indeed summarize the aspirations of all our countries and peoples.@@@There can therefore be no secure and prosperous future for us all without achieving those pillars, which in turn can be achieved only through solidarity and collective action to avoid further wars, conflicts, challenges, human tragedies and material and environmental losses.@@@Kotahi ano te kdhao o te ngira e kuhii ai te miro ma, te miro whero, te miro pango, Kia man Kia te ture, te whakapono ko te mea nui ko te aroha.@@@There is only one eye of the needle, through which the white, the red and black threads must pass.@@@Hold fast to the lore, faith and, above all else, love.@@@These opening words, taken from my ancestors, remind me that no matter where we are from around the world, we are bound by a shared spirit of humanity.@@@I acknowledge the Lenape people, on whose tribal lands we stand.@@@Tena koutou katoa.@@@I have been encouraged by the commitment I have witnessed in this great Hall to find transformative solutions to the interlocking challenges we face.@@@At the same time.@@@I am deeply concerned that the sum of our collective efforts to meet those challenges is falling well short of what is required.@@@We meet at a time of sharply increasing danger for people and the planet.@@@As we emerge from the worst health emergency in the past 100 years, our efforts to build back better have faltered in the face of accelerating ecological and planetary crises, deepening conflict and instability.@@@We are failing to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@We must rise to meet these challenges.@@@We owe it to our citizens and to the generations that follow us.@@@Mounting distrust and division are eroding the foundation of international cooperation and steering the multilateral system towards deadlock and dysfunction.@@@We have no hope of meeting our shared challenges by going it alone.@@@We live in an interconnected and 
interdependent world, in which we will thrive — or perish — together.@@@For the first time in several generations, we face the very real possibility of conflict between major Powers.@@@We cannot let that happen.@@@The stakes for all of us are simply too high.@@@The international rule of law and the Charter of the United Nations must mean something to a growing generation that is becoming increasingly sceptical.@@@We are not on track to keep global warming at 1.5°C.@@@Conflict and crises continue to impact, most harshly on women and children.@@@The fabric of democratic principles is being challenged and weakened by misinformation and disinformation, and the list continues.@@@Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine last year was a direct attack on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a United Nations Member State.@@@But it was much more than that.@@@To witness a permanent member of the Security Council launch an unprovoked attack on a sovereign State, attempting to annex its territory and waging war on its civilian population remains shocking.@@@Russia’s actions violate the most fundamental tenets of international law.@@@How can younger generations have confidence in the United Nations when a permanent member of the Security Council acts in a manner so fundamentally contrary to the United Nations Charter?@@@The consequences of Russia’s ongoing war of aggression are stark.@@@The suffering of Ukrainians is immense.@@@Ukraine’s neighbours are bearing a heavy burden.@@@Sadly, we are seeing children being weaponized in this unjust war.@@@That is wrong in every way.@@@Aotearoa New Zealand strongly supports efforts to hold Russia to account in both the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court.@@@This war has also highlighted geostrategic tensions and heightened nuclear risks.@@@Nuclear weapons must never be used.@@@We must be unequivocal in our determination to reduce nuclear threats and do so immediately.@@@The dangers of nuclear weapons and their toxic legacy, which are visible in our own blue Pacific region, have been with us for decades.@@@Other, newer technological developments also pose profound challenges in balancing the potential of their peaceful use with the threat of catastrophic harm if their development and military use is left unchecked.@@@We must commit to international rules and limits on autonomous weapon systems and establish clear norms to address responsible use of other new and emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence, as well as the continued peaceful use of outer space.@@@We must also confront digital challenges, including cyberthreats and online extremism through smart coalitions, in which Governments work effectively with civil society and industry.@@@That is our approach with the Christchurch Call to Action to Eliminate Terrorist and Violent Extremist Content Online.@@@The Christchurch Call is a global multi-stakeholder coalition that extends beyond traditional statecraft and governmental institutions.@@@It has successfully galvanized significant policy change, improved the crisis readiness of technology companies and built strong, collaborative relationships across sectors.@@@Conflict and crisis is placing incredible pressure on the humanitarian system.@@@Food insecurity is threatening the lives of hundreds of millions of people across the globe.@@@Let me be clear — food is not a weapon and hunger is not a tool.@@@Pervasive drought in the Horn of Africa and instability and violence in the Sahel.@@@Afghanistan.@@@Syria and Myanmar have left many millions in need of urgent humanitarian assistance.@@@Playing politics with innocent lives is cruel and immoral.@@@As we mark the halfway point in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, it is time to move beyond divisive narratives and polemics.@@@Now is the time to act to achieve meaningful progress against the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@The call to action is urgent.@@@In December, we will celebrate the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.@@@Last December, we reaffirmed our unwavering commitment to speak out against violations of human rights, wherever they occur.@@@There is no hierarchy when it comes to human rights abuses.@@@We need to resist attempts to undermine or hollow out existing commitments.@@@Aotearoa New Zealand will continue to fiercely protect the rights of women and girls.@@@New Zealand has long and deep connections to the Pacific through language, peoples, ocean, history, culture, politics and shared interests.@@@We also have a strong connection to the wider Indo-Pacific region.@@@We are concerned that the order that has underpinned prosperity and security in our region for most of the past seven decades is increasingly fraying.@@@We do not believe that recent events witnessed in other parts of 
the world need become the inevitable trajectory of our blue Pacific region.@@@Diplomacy is our strongest tool.@@@Peace and stability is our goal.@@@Our regional architecture must be inclusive and provide space for all those who wish to contribute positively to our region.@@@And those who engage in our region must understand Pacific values and norms.@@@We are committed to promoting the centrality of the Pacific Islands Forum in addressing regional challenges through the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent, which is our road map.@@@International partners are encouraged to listen, engage and contribute to the sustainable development of our Pacific region in a manner that puts the priorities of the Pacific first and recognizes the independence of those for whom the region is home.@@@The message to the partners of the Pacific is commitment with consistency.@@@Recent global shocks have reminded us that building resilient communities and societies requires a broad and holistic approach to development.@@@Strengthening resilience requires us to value progress across all dimensions of well-being.@@@Social, economic and environmental development are interlinked and interdependent.@@@We must urgently achieve reform that contributes to the intergenerational well-being of developing States.@@@We acknowledge the Secretary-General’s call to find systemic solutions to the shortcomings of the international financial architecture.@@@International financial institutions need to evolve to better serve the demands of the current era.@@@We are encouraged to see a growing recognition of the broader measures of development that go beyond gross national income.@@@Tools such as the Multidimensional Vulnerability Index offer opportunities to respond to the realities of those who are most vulnerable to external shocks, such as small island developing States.@@@Sustainable development will be achieved only if the international community delivers on its commitments to those who are experiencing the violent realities of climate change.@@@Climate change is the greatest existential threat facing our planet.@@@A stable climate is essential to a stable future.@@@New Zealand is committed to playing its part in the global efforts to combat the triple planetary crisis of climate change, pollution and biodiversity loss.@@@No country is immune to the impacts of climate change, which are real and happening now.@@@The countries of the Pacific are on the front lines and are already experiencing irreversible loss and damage.@@@The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has sent a very clear message that the world is not on track to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.@@@The first global stocktake of the Paris Agreement, which will take place at the twenty-eighth Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to be held later this year, is an opportunity for a course correction.@@@Limiting warming to 1.5°C is vital to achieve our shared development goals.@@@Every increment of a degree and every ton of emissions matters.@@@We have a narrow and rapidly closing window to secure a sustainable and liveable future for all of us and our children.@@@We call on all countries, especially major emitters, to align their actions with limiting the temperature increase to 1.5°C.@@@That means committing to a global phase-out of fossil fuels.@@@Aotearoa New Zealand is taking ambitious action to support the transition to low-emission economies, climate-resilient agriculture and sustainable trade policies.@@@Domestically, we are transitioning to a low- emission and climate-resilient future and working to meet our 1.5°C-aligned nationally determined contribution.@@@We have committed to reducing our emissions by 50 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030.@@@Our first emissions-reduction plan sets out the actions we will take to achieve our first emissions budgets on a pathway to our 2050 target.@@@We are investing in Pacific resilience, mobilizing climate financing and supporting Pacific partners to prepare and respond to climate-driven events.@@@At least half of our quadrupled $1.3 billion climate-finance commitment will go to the Pacific.@@@At COP 27, we stood with the Pacific on the priority issue of loss and damage.@@@New Zealand supports Australia’s bid to host COP 31 in 2026, in partnership with the Pacific region.@@@We were delighted by the consensus adoption of General Assembly resolution 77/276, on requesting an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice on the obligations of States with respect to climate change.@@@We acknowledge Vanuatu’s leadership in that regard.@@@New Zealand was a proud member of the core group that drove that initiative, which was an example of effective, cross-regional multilateral diplomacy.@@@Going forward, we will work with a diverse coalition to address the adverse impacts of sea level rise, including preserving the heritage, statehood and sovereignty of 
countries facing existential threats as a result of the climate crisis.@@@Aotearoa New Zealand welcomed the adoption in March of the Agreement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ), which represents the most significant upgrade of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea framework in 40 years.@@@We celebrate the fact that more than 70 States have signed the BBNJ Agreement this week.@@@It reminds us of what we can achieve when we focus on our interests in the planet we share and work long and hard to bridge divides between States.@@@We also applauded the United Nations Environment Assembly’s agreement last year to launch negotiations on an international legally binding instrument to end plastic pollution.@@@The Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, agreed last year, marked a welcome step forward in halting and reversing biodiversity loss.@@@Those significant successes show that the stakes are too high for us to leave the triple planetary crisis solely in the hands of Governments.@@@We need indigenous peoples, businesses, financial institutions, local Governments, young people, communities and individuals to play their crucial roles.@@@Contemporizing our multilateral institutions to ensure they are inclusive and fit for today’s challenges must be a high priority.@@@There has never been a greater need for innovation and creativity to secure the central place of the United Nations in addressing the collective challenges we face.@@@That is why New Zealand actively supports initiatives to revitalize and reform the United Nations, its organs and the wider multilateral system.@@@As a founding Member of the United Nations and an unwavering supporter of the international rules-based system, it is difficult to admit that our multilateral institutions are imperfect.@@@They have — and they will — fail us.@@@But Aotearoa New Zealand’s response will always be to find ways to make them stronger.@@@Fiercely independent but global in our outlook, we are driven by a strong sense of our responsibility to help to uphold the key tenets of the international rules-based system — respect for State sovereignty and respect for human rights and gender equality, and the will to achieve progress in addressing climate change and nuclear weapons.@@@It is clear that the norms and rules established by the Charter, including exercising tolerance and uniting in our strengths, are under considerable strain.@@@Aotearoa acknowledges the legitimacy of distinct political systems, histories and cultures.@@@At home, we choose to embrace difference as a source of strength for resolving challenges rather than as a wedge to divide.@@@We hold onto the hope of our forebears and the promise of the sense of nationhood set out in our founding document, the Treaty of Waitangi.@@@The people we serve deserve our vigilance to achieve that goal.@@@Ours is an Organization made up primarily of small States.@@@To deliver on the needs of small States and to achieve truly effective and inclusive multilateralism, we need to find ways to all pull in the same direction — yes, on our own terms, but in the same direction.@@@Next year’s Summit of the Future, which has its origins in the Secretary-General’s Our Common Agenda (A/75/982), provides an opportunity to rebuild trust among nations and contemporize the way we work.@@@We can — and should — take full advantage of that opportunity.@@@New Zealand stands ready to work with partners to ensure a robust outcome that best serves present and future generations.@@@Never in recent history has there been a greater need for transformative solutions to interlocking global challenges.@@@I for one do not believe in inevitabilities.@@@We must be purposeful.@@@In fact, the disruptions we are enduring provide an opportunity for a reset.@@@We need to rise above polarization and draw strength from our differences, rather than allowing them to create division.@@@Let me end by saying, whirl a te tangata — we must weave all our aspirations and our common and shared humanity together.@@@Nd reira, tend koutou katoa.@@@Te aroha

With love, faith and hope, we can all unite ourselves amid the sheer desperation.@@@On the occasion of the seventy-eighth session of the General Assembly of our common institution, on behalf of my country.@@@Togo, and His Excellency President Faure Essozimna Gnassingbe, allow me first of all to offer my warm congratulations to Mr. Dennis Francis of Trinidad and Tobago on his election and his skill in conducting the work of this session.@@@My warm congratulations also go not only to his predecessor.@@@Mr. Csaba Korosi, who presided over our work last year, but also, and above all, to Secretary- General Antonio Guterres, who is doing the best that he can to restore the image of the United Nations as a modern institution despite the procrastination and complexity of the path of the reform.@@@I would also like to convey the condolences and support of the President of the Togolese Republic.@@@Mr. Faure Essozimna Gnassingbe, and the Togolese people to the brotherly peoples and Governments of the Kingdom of Morocco and Libya following the earthquake and the floods in each of their countries, respectively.@@@As we meet here today, it is clear that our world is not in particularly good shape.@@@It is deeply sick, and its pathology calls on us to assume as high a level of responsibility as the United Nations.@@@Do our commitments match the scale of the challenges?@@@That is the question of which we cannot lose sight if our ambition at the United Nations is truly to improve the state of the world in order to grant our peoples and our various countries greater opportunity, safety, security and assurance.@@@Our world is increasingly less secure.@@@Trust and solidarity among nations are almost at half-mast, and we have the high responsibility to work to repair it by rediscovering the meaning of our noblest commitments.@@@The choice and relevance of the theme that guides the general debate of this seventh-eighth session of the General Assembly, namely.@@@“Rebuilding trust and reigniting global solidarity: accelerating action on the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals towards peace, prosperity, progress and sustainability for all”, clearly and unmistakably conveys not only the unsustainable, disrupted and unstable state of the world, but also our determination at a higher level to do things for the better.@@@The emergence of new sources of tension in the world must concern us.@@@I come from a country.@@@Togo, and from a continent that is currently under great strain.@@@Africa, oh, our Africa, the Africa of freedoms, the Africa of our fathers, oh, the Africa of our mothers, is wounded and bruised.@@@Our continent.@@@Africa, is facing multisectoral vulnerability — vulnerability due to our weak revenue and low levels of development, vulnerability due to major health crises, vulnerability due to the effects of climate change and vulnerability due to the disruption of global food supply chains.@@@It is a vulnerability due to the encroachment of African cyberspace by cybercriminals and disinformation, vulnerability due to the recurrence of armed conflicts and the prevalence of war, and vulnerability due to the spread on the continent of international terrorism, threatening international peace and stability.@@@In recent years, terrorism has developed at an alarming rate on our continent in the Sahel, the Horn of Africa region and Southern Africa.@@@Africa risks becoming a safe haven for international terrorism and remaining the weakest link in the global security system.@@@Our coastal countries on the Gulf of Guinea, long spared, have begun to pay a heavy toll due to terrorism.@@@To respond effectively to the terrorist threat.@@@Togo has therefore taken innovative multisectoral measures, as set out in its strategy document to combat violent extremism, adopted on 5 July 2022.@@@That strategy makes it possible to balance security and development approaches by combining operational and legal measures with more flexible endogenous measures.@@@It includes the emergency programme for the Savannah region, with an overall budget estimated at more than $324 million for the implementation of various projects in the water, energy, health, infrastructure, education and agriculture sectors by 2025.@@@I would like to take this opportunity to express the Togolese Government’s gratitude to all our partners in the fight against terrorism, and we hope that the various partnerships will be steadily strengthened in order to put an end to that terrorist maelstrom.@@@Given the many situations of vulnerability and crisis in Africa, and which basically spare no country 
on the continent, the Togolese Government is working at the national level to advance the development agenda through an ambitious road map 2020-2025.@@@Togo has implemented a series of priority projects with economic, social and structural benefits for our people.@@@Health, through the introduction of universal health coverage, food security, socioeconomic inclusion, decent work for the advancement of all and shared prosperity remain priority areas for Government action.@@@The Government’s efforts to make Togo a country open to the world continue.@@@We are committed to strengthening economic, social and democratic stability, which helps to attract investors and guarantee Togo’s place as a preferred destination.@@@The multifaceted actions that we are taking are in line with the United Nations and African commitments of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and Agenda 2063, and they are in line with the quest for sustainable development shared by all Members of the United Nations.@@@That programme gives pride of place to environmental protection and preservation.@@@It is the practical expression of Togo’s determination to join the international effort to combat the harmful effects of climate change.@@@To ensure the sustainable management and protection of marine and coastal ecosystems, the Togolese Government has therefore focused its priorities, on the one hand, on the sustainable management and protection of marine and coastal ecosystems, the regulation of fishing, the reduction of the vulnerability of people and property to extreme climatic phenomena and, on the other hand, on the fight against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and the promotion of the blue economy.@@@In terms of the sustainable protection of the marine and coastal environment.@@@Togo has set up a regional programme for integrated coastal management and combating coastal erosion.@@@Togo aims to protect 90 per cent of its coastline by 2025.@@@Finally, in the context of preserving and restoring ecosystems and combating desertification.@@@Togo has launched a major national reforestation programme to plant 1 billion trees by 2030, banned the import, marketing and use of glyphosate, and all products containing it, and promoted the use of biopesticides and biofertilizers in our country.@@@In the area of renewable energies, strategic and diversified partnerships have been forged to provide reliable, modern and low-cost services in rural areas.@@@A fund for access to electricity for all, called the Tinga Fund, was therefore established in order to enable Togo to ensure universal access to reliable, sustainable, modern and affordable energy services by 2030.@@@Through the Cizo project, solar energy kits are supplied to vulnerable rural populations throughout the country, while the Government tirelessly continues to install photovoltaic power plants and miniature solar power plants, thereby helping to boost the contribution of renewable energy to Togo’s energy management policy.@@@Accordingly, we welcome the commitments and announcements made at the twenty-seventh session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP27), in particular the establishment of a specific fund to finance loss and damage to vulnerable countries hit hard by climate-related disasters.@@@That is a major step towards the climate justice for which developing countries have been calling.@@@However, much remains to be done to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and the use of fossil fuels, among other things.@@@In that regard, we hope that COP28, to be held in Dubai in November this year, will enable us to see significant progress in the implementation of the commitments that we made.@@@The Climate Ambition Summit, held here on 20 September, was an opportune moment to demonstrate the existence of genuine will to expedite the implementation of a just transition towards a world that is equitable and more resilient to climate change.@@@In the continent’s challenging environment, characterized by the spread of international terrorism and the emergence of new areas of tension.@@@Africa is seeking its way forward, and Togo supports peace efforts in Africa.@@@Terrorism and instability in Africa are issues of international security and must be treated as such by the United Nations.@@@Our West African region, where several States are in transition in a volatile security context, must be supported in a spirit of active solidarity.@@@We must invest more in peace than we do in war.@@@If the protagonists of the world’s various conflicts are listening to us.@@@I would like to tell them that war is a denial of human dignity.@@@Immanuel Kant, that great 
philosopher of the Enlightenment, said that if the decision-makers in war could send their own children to the front, there would never be a war.@@@Togo is a country of peace, and Togo opposes war for any reason.@@@Since our independence on 27 April 1960.@@@Togo has never waged war on its neighbours.@@@Togo has never attacked its neighbours or any other country.@@@Togo has never served as a rear base for any form of aggression against a brother country.@@@Togo is a country of peace.@@@Peace is in the DNA of the Togolese people.@@@Togo has always been a country of mediation that favours dialogue, negotiation and understanding among peoples and Governments.@@@On 6 January.@@@49 Ivorian soldiers were released thanks to the mediation of the President of the Togolese Republic.@@@President Faure Essozimna Gnassingbe, putting an end to the tension between the Governments of Cote d’Ivoire and Mali.@@@Togo hosted various peace talks on its territory.@@@We can cite them.@@@There was Chad in 1982.@@@Sierra Leone in 1991, the Liberian war in 1991.@@@Cote d’Ivoire in 2000, et cetera, et cetera.@@@We call for the de-escalation and cessation of hostilities in the various hotbeds of tension in the world, in particular in West Africa.@@@Africa has suffered too much from war, and a minimum sense of responsibility must convince us to invest in the prevention and peaceful resolution of conflicts.@@@The bad thing about war, said our writer Immanuel Kant, is that it makes more villains than it can take away.@@@External interference causes conflict and crisis in Africa.@@@It generally complicates the search for solutions to our crises and undermines African initiatives to find solutions to African crises.@@@It is no longer welcome in an Africa that is aware of its own responsibilities in resolving the problems of peace, security and development.@@@Africa no longer wants external interference.@@@Africa wants to remain itself and the master of its destiny.@@@On the African continent for the past few months, the Sudan, a brother country, has been affected by an armed conflict that is causing a great deal of concern.@@@Aware of the importance of peace and security for sustainable and inclusive development.@@@Togo, which has made those one of the main axes of its development policy, hosted, under the aegis of the President of the Republic.@@@President Faure Essozimna Gnassingbe, a consultative and cooperative dialogue among the political and military leaders of Darfur in Lome in July, with a view to contributing to the resolution of the Sudanese conflict.@@@Those consultations led to a compromise to put an end to the violence and create a humanitarian corridor.@@@In order to achieve the full implementation of the commitments made in Lome, and thereby relieve the suffering of the civilian population, we urge the Sudanese parties to the conflict to favour the path of dialogue and consultation for a rapid settlement of the differences in the best interests of the Sudan.@@@We hope that the Togolese approach, which supports other initiatives, will help to put an end to the conflict, which, strangely, is not receiving the attention that it should from the international community.@@@In West Africa and the Sahel, the recent years have also been marked by unconstitutional devolutions of power, with the setting up of transitional regimes, whose reappearance, beyond the issues that they raise, oblige us to rethink our systems of governance.@@@Those and many other issues will be examined at the Lome Peace and Security Forum, the first of which is scheduled for 21 and 22 October, under the theme of strengthening transitions to democratic governance in Africa.@@@The aim is to examine how to develop strategies to meet the challenges of political transition in a coordinated, relevant and effective manner.@@@With the political and security crises that are transforming Africa, it is even more necessary to adopt a posture of adaptation.@@@Thus.@@@Togo and several other countries decided in Lome in May to create the African Political Alliance, which is intended to be a framework for consultation, political dialogue and joint action, based on the historical ties of fraternity and the principles of the sovereign equality of States, dependence and unity of action.@@@As far as the reform of the Security Council is concerned, we do not want to go back over it again.@@@We have already said that Africa can no longer remain on the sidelines of the organ responsible for ensuring international peace and security.@@@The Security Council can no longer remain merely the preserve of the victors and their allies of the Second World War.@@@Nothing can justify maintaining the status quo.@@@The ideological and institutional architecture of the post-war world is now obsolete.@@@The status quo cannot continue.@@@We are in a new era in Africa’s and the global South’s relations with the world, and in the new dynamic Africa no longer intends to remain in the shadow of any great Power.@@@The time is past when other entities claimed to speak on behalf of an Africa that they do not even listen to here at the United Nations and on the international stage.@@@Africa’s partners, new and old, which are still reluctant to accept the new direction taken by Africa in the process of historical evolution, must change their attitude and approach to an Africa that has changed profoundly.@@@Over the past few decades, our world has undergone great silent revolutions, the profound significance of which lies in the qualitative renewal that they bring about in relations among nations, and which accompanies them throughout their own history.@@@The reality of the world is that there are no longer monopolistic centres of gravity.@@@The centre of the world now is here and nowhere else.@@@No one is the centre of the world.@@@In any case, what is clear and what I would like to recall here is that Africa now looks at its relations with the great Powers in terms of its own interests.@@@Last year, at this same platform.@@@I told the Assembly that Africa no longer wanted to align itself with the great Powers, whichever they may be (see A/77/PV.11).@@@The role assigned to Africa in the twenty-first century is evocative of the image that certain Powers of our continent still have: their zone of influence.@@@We must be concerned about the place that Africa occupies on the world stage.@@@Today Africa does not occupy the place that it should hold on the international scene.@@@The great Powers want to reduce Africa to a purely instrumental entity in the service of their causes, and they obviously do not want the continent to be able to play an important role.@@@The fractures of the colonial era among a so-called French-. Spanish-. Portuguese-. Arabic-@@@and English- speaking Africa have diminished, as have the postCold War ideologies that dominated the entire second part of the twentieth century.@@@Today Africa wants to be itself.@@@We say today, as we said last year, we prefer Africanophone.@@@Africa expects more equality, respect, equity and justice in its relations and partnerships with the rest of the world and with the major Powers, whichever they may be.@@@Today Africans want to be true partners.@@@Africa certainly does not have the same megaphones as a great Power of the world, but the voice of Africa counts, and it must count if we want to have Africa as a partner on major international issues.@@@The issue of the reform of the global multilateral architecture is of such concern to Africa that it will be at the heart of the 2024 ninth Pan-African Congress, to be held in Lome.@@@For those who do not know, now is the time for an African, a pan-African, awakening.@@@As part of the pan-African impetus, and in line with the noble objectives of the fathers of African independence.@@@Africa and Africans are calling for, and expect, their own voices to be heard on the international stage in a sovereign, free and independent manner.@@@Africa knows what it wants.@@@The peoples of Africa and the global South are frustrated because they feel insulted and dehumanized.@@@Sometimes they ask themselves: who are you to scorn our humanity in that way?@@@Who are you to scorn us like that?@@@Who are you to humiliate us like that?@@@Our continental organization, the African Union, is working to best convey the hope and voice of a healthy Africa that wishes to be sovereign, free and independent on the international stage.@@@We are also working to that end as part of the African Political Alliance, launched in Lome.@@@The rivalry among the great Powers need not primarily be African rivalries.@@@The challenge for us, as African nations, is to avoid taking part in rivalries that are not our own.@@@We must fight our own battles, which include the struggle against neo-colonialism, the struggle against poverty, the industrialization of the continent, economic prosperity, the fight for peace, the struggle against the de-Africanization of Africa and for an African renaissance and dignity, the struggle to free ourselves once and for all from foreign subordination and the commitment to ensuring a better representation of our continent in the concert of nations and continents.@@@Our struggles are neither those of the West nor those of the East, still less those of any one side or part of the world.@@@We must focus on our current and future struggles.@@@International politics cannot be reduced to a captive field, where we are obliged to take a position in favour of one side against another.@@@We want a reformed international system, based on values and principles that are respected by all and that are respectful of the right of peoples to freely position themselves as they see fit on the international stage.@@@The right of peoples 
to self-determination implies the right of each State to behave as it wishes on the international stage within the limits of respect for its international commitments.@@@On the major transnational challenges of our century, such as climate change and the fight against international terrorism, our views may intersect with those of others, but they must remain our deeply considered views, decided in accordance with our own agendas.@@@There is no longer any question of the Africa that we want and wishing to play a secondary role in the dynamics of global change.@@@The Africa about which I am talking is no longer prepared to accept the tendency of certain countries to make their geostrategic agendas the concerns of Africans.@@@The challenges facing our world are indeed great, and Africa’s new directions in terms of foreign relations are driven by the dynamics of renewal and a paradigm shift.@@@The time has come for an African and panAfrican awakening, where our continent has regained an awareness of itself and of its responsibilities, both internally and towards the rest of the world.@@@Africa needs a partnership that respects the full dignity of every individual.@@@We want to be partners, not subjects.@@@We want to serve our peoples, not foreign interests.@@@As we repeatedly say, that new dynamic is not directed against anyone.@@@It is the expression of a new Africa, an African Africa, an African-speaking Africa that wants to be free, sovereign, independent and in control of itself.@@@In short, it is clear to Africa’s youth.@@@Those words are clear.@@@It is this.@@@It is that we are tired of paternalism.@@@We are tired of contempt for our people’s views, for our people and our leaders.@@@We are tired of the condescension.@@@We are tired of the arrogance.@@@We are tired, we are tired, we are tired.@@@It is an honour to address the General Assembly once again.@@@I represent Georgia, a strong nation that values freedom, cherishes its rich heritage and embraces progress amid an ever-changing geopolitical landscape.@@@As members are aware, my country experienced a full-scale military aggression in 2008 and continues to endure its destructive consequences.@@@That is still evident in the occupation of 20 per cent of Georgian territory by the Russian Federation and the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people from their homes.@@@I can confidently state that despite the devastation that we have endured, we have not hesitated to pursue our ambitions.@@@We have transformed Georgia into a dynamic society, fully committed to the realization of the fundamental principles and values enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.@@@Georgia understands the cost of war and recognizes the value of peace.@@@Since 2012, our Government has built and maintained an uninterrupted decade of peace and stability.@@@I would like to take this opportunity to express our deep appreciation to the international community for its unwavering support for Georgia’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.@@@To ensure our continued peaceful existence.@@@I call on the international community to persuade the Russian Federation to engage with the Geneva international discussions and fully implement the European Union (EU)-mediated 2008 ceasefire agreement.@@@Thanks to our pragmatic foreign policy, we have sustained economic growth over the past decade.@@@We continue to make critical investments to improve the quality of life for all Georgians.@@@We have experienced double-digit economic growth for two consecutive years, with a gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate of more than 10 per cent in 2021 and 2022.@@@That positive growth trend has continued in 2023, with an average rate of economic growth of 7 per cent.@@@A substantial increase in GDP per capita is among my Government’s most significant achievements.@@@Since 2012.@@@GDP per capita has nearly doubled.@@@We expect that that positive trend will continue.@@@In addition, in July, our official reserve assets reached a historic high, representing nearly a 90 per cent increase in July 2023 compared with 2012.@@@The unemployment and poverty rates are also at historical lows.@@@The World Justice Project’s 2022 Rule of Law Index places Georgia as the top-ranking country in the Eastern Europe and Central Asia regions regarding the rule of law.@@@According to the Eraser Institute’s annual report.@@@“Economic Freedom of the World 2022”.@@@Georgia is among the top 15 countries with the freest economies, while the Heritage Foundation Index of Economic Freedom 2023 places Georgia twenty-first in Europe, ahead of 11 European Union member States.@@@The Crime Index 2023 positions Georgia as one of the safest countries in the world, ranking eighteenth in the world and eighth in Europe.@@@My Government developed and approved “Vision 2030 - Development Strategy of Georgia”, our country’s first long-term policy framework, which outlines a comprehensive set of reforms covering areas such as economic functions, social progress, good governance, justice and human rights protection, to be implemented by 2030.@@@While we work towards comprehensive, multifaceted progress, we also place significant emphasis on education and social welfare.@@@The importance of robust education systems cannot be overstated, since they serve as the cornerstone for empowered, prosperous and productive societies.@@@We embrace education by allocating resources to enhance digital literacy and bridge the digital divide.@@@Our efforts extend to all levels of education.@@@We have allocated up to $1 billion to rehabilitate and construct schools and kindergartens across the country.@@@We have increased investments in health care and social welfare.@@@Currently.@@@95 per cent of our population benefits from universal health care, and we are continuously improving the quality of those services.@@@We are determined to ensure the best possible care for all citizens.@@@Those successes are just a fraction of the progress that my country has made, but they clearly demonstrate our efforts to create opportunities for all our citizens, including those residing in the occupied territories of Georgia.@@@I say to our Abkhazian and Ossetian brothers and sisters that it is our common adversary that opposes our unity.@@@We are an ingenious people, capable of incredible accomplishments, but only together can we ensure lasting stability, attract increased investments and reach our full potential as a united nation.@@@We must not let this opportunity for a peaceful, stable and prosperous future together slip from our grasp.@@@Each step we take is aimed at bringing Georgia back into the European family, where it belongs.@@@The remarkable achievements of our Government since 2012, including the EU association agreement, the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement and the visa-free regime with the European Union, demonstrate our geopolitical priority of becoming a State member of the European Union.@@@The recognition last June of Georgia’s “European perspective” has opened a new chapter in our relationship with the European Union.@@@Recent surveys show that nearly 90 per cent of Georgians support EU membership, and we have demonstrated an unwavering commitment to addressing the 12 priorities set forth for EU candidate status.@@@Through a rigorous, inclusive and transparent domestic implementation process involving all stakeholders, we are on track to complete them this year.@@@Our achievements deserve a favourable decision from the EU.@@@As a front-runner among the so-called Associated Trio countries.@@@Georgia has earned EU candidate status.@@@We anticipate that Georgia’s performance and the current geopolitical context in the region will be fairly evaluated.@@@Granting Georgia candidate status is the only course of action.@@@Considering recent developments.@@@I would like to emphasize the importance of the rules-based international order and the fundamental principles outlined in the Charter of the United Nations.@@@Georgia is a responsible member of the international community actively contributing to global peace.@@@For 
more than two decades, we have made substantial contributions to NATO missions worldwide, making Georgia one of the largest per capita contributors to the NATO missions in Iraq and Afghanistan.@@@Thirty-two brave Georgian soldiers made the ultimate sacrifice in Afghanistan, while hundreds of others suffered injuries in the pursuit of freedom and peace.@@@Georgia has sacrificed greatly to protect our shared values and common interests.@@@Georgia reiterates its unwavering commitment in that respect.@@@We have significantly contributed to Tilled missions and honour that commitment.@@@As we strive for peace, prosperity, progress and sustainability for all, it is disheartening to witness aggression against a State Member of the United Nations.@@@The war in Ukraine reawakens the trauma of the 2008 war in Georgia.@@@We feel the pain and hardship that Ukraine currently faces and stand in full solidarity with the Ukrainian people.@@@We have sponsored, joined and supported more than 500 resolutions, statements, joint statements and other initiatives by major international organizations and institutions to support Ukraine and the Ukrainian people.@@@Our Western partners, including the United States, the European Union and the United Kingdom, have repeatedly praised our compliance with all international financial sanctions.@@@My Government has been providing substantial humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and to its people since the beginning of the war, both in the country and to those currently residing in Georgia.@@@Georgian schools have welcomed more than 2.200 Ukrainian students, ensuring that most of them receive education in the Ukrainian language while following the official Ukrainian curriculum.@@@Let me be clear: the fundamental philosophy of our Government is to avoid war and secure peace.@@@Despite the challenges posed by our geographic location, we have managed to keep our people safe while supporting Ukraine and the international community through prudent policies and close coordination with our partners.@@@Through my Government’s Peaceful Neighbor Initiative, we are prepared to engage with our neighbours and friends from Armenia and Azerbaijan to finally bring lasting peace to the South Caucasus.@@@Georgia is emerging as a multidimensional regional hub.@@@Our financial services sector has garnered global recognition, and we are attracting international investors, infusing additional capital into our economy.@@@We have also prioritized investments in our infrastructure to enhance connectivity, successfully harnessing the logistics and energy sectors.@@@We are developing strategic transport corridors to establish crucial connections between Asia and Europe.@@@Georgia’s participation in various international initiatives and infrastructure projects enhance connectivity, facilitating trade across the Black Sea region.@@@The Middle Corridor has been emerging as a secure and reliable route connecting East with West.@@@We have signed comprehensive road maps with Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan to eliminate bottlenecks and enhance the Middle Corridor, from 2022 to 2027.@@@Those road maps provide for specific actions related to transport and logistics infrastructure development, operational optimization, the implementation of a unified tariff policy, corridor digitalization and improvements to the regulatory framework.@@@In pursuit of enhancing East-West connectivity.@@@Georgia established the Tbilisi Silk Road Forum in 2015, creating an international platform for dialogue among senior policymakers, businesses and community leaders.@@@The upcoming Silk Road Forum is scheduled to take place in Tbilisi this year on 26 and 27 October, bringing together approximately 2.000 representatives, including high-ranking officials and business representatives from more than 60 countries.@@@Georgia has launched significant infrastructure projects, including the railway modernization project.@@@Upon its completion by the end of 2024, the throughput capacity of Georgian railways will double.@@@The construction of a new Anaklia deep-sea port, which is expected to start soon, is a top priority for my Government.@@@That greenfield public-private partnership project will create a state-of-the-art deep- sea port on the eastern coast of the Black Sea.@@@Our Government is improving air connectivity by building a new international airport in Tbilisi that will serve as a world-class transportation hub, cementing Georgia’s status as a prominent player in global aviation.@@@Furthermore, the EU flagship Black Sea submarine cable project, initiated by Georgia, is currently under way.@@@That project involves the installation of a high- voltage submarine transmission grid to connect the South Caucasus region to South-East Europe through 
an underwater cable.@@@The implementation of the project will strengthen energy security in Europe and in the South Caucasus region, foster the development of renewable energy sources and create new opportunities for transit between those two regions.@@@While recognizing the increasing demand for energy as well as the need to address climate change, we are actively pursuing new ventures in the field of renewable energy, including hydropower, wind, solar and other sustainable sources.@@@Our objective is to attract investors and create a favourable environment for the establishment of innovative power plants, utilizing Georgia’s abundant green energy potential.@@@All those ambitious transformational projects will bring jobs, economic growth and prosperity to our people and the entire region.@@@Georgia has made significant progress since regaining independence.@@@We remain dedicated to achieving even greater results for the Georgian people while making significant contributions to the global community.@@@We stand ready to strengthen international partnerships and collaboration to ensure a more peaceful and sustainable future.@@@Our shared humanity binds us together, and it is our collective responsibility to uplift one another and leave a lasting legacy for the generations to come.@@@Building on the theme of this year’s session of the General Assembly.@@@“Rebuilding trust and reigniting global solidarity: Accelerating action on the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals towards peace, prosperity, progress and the sustainability for all”, from this important rostrum, allow me to talk about vital elements from the point of view of the small but proud State of Bosnia and Herzegovina.@@@For its part.@@@Bosnia and Herzegovina has given support to the 2030 Agenda, especially its Goals, which are fully related to creating a world and an environment among United Nations members so that we as States and our societies can train and prepare ourselves to implement all the steps that can lead us to self-sustainable development.@@@However, in today’s world, often dominated by war and various geopolitical goals, that will be very difficult to achieve, at least in the way it was planned in the 2030 Agenda.@@@For that reason.@@@I want to emphasize that our first step should be one that leads us to enduring peace.@@@That is the world’s first priority.@@@From there we can move to other mutually connected actions that can prepare our countries and societies for solidarity and progress.@@@Those actions are by no means easy, and they require a great deal of wisdom, planning and good management of all the processes and procedures that can help us implement the 2030 Agenda.@@@If we start with the theme of this year’s session of the General Assembly, which talks about building trust and encouraging global solidarity.@@@I would like to point out in a few sentences the elements that could possibly make achieving those goals difficult.@@@At the outset.@@@I take this opportunity to remind the Assembly that migration is one of the elements that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is attempting to address systematically and through the implementation of specific governance.@@@Although the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 
recognizes migrants as agents of change and enablers for development in countries of origin, transit and destination, the Agenda primarily focuses on the migrant as a beneficiary of the ends of sustainable development, e.g, through greater protections, rights and transparency.@@@Furthermore, the Agenda does not make reference to the broader concept of diasporas or to the role that they do and can play in development.@@@That statement, taken from the document entitled Migration in the 2030 Agenda of the International Organization for Migration, is certainly true, but when it comes to the starting point of migration, that is, the situation on the ground in certain countries, we see several things that are undeniably happening.@@@The current form of migration management has reached a stage in which large and powerful countries, for their own benefit, are carrying out a certain type of selection of migrants in such a way as to select the best and most educated among them, such as doctors, engineers, scientists and other highly qualified persons, and are ushering them to larger countries where their knowledge and abilities are exploited exclusively for the benefit of those larger systems.@@@In larger countries and larger systems, such selected migrants can be agents of change or bearers of various improvements, but at the same time the potential and capacities of the smaller countries from which the migrants are coming from are being weakened.@@@Small countries, in addition to losing their most qualified personnel, are also losing all the investments they have made, including financial investments, in creating those highly qualified profiles.@@@Of course, it is completely clear that there is a form of migration in which large groups of people are trying to escape war and the horrors of war, but there is also what we call economic migration through which migrants are being directed based on their potential and capacities.@@@In both cases of migration, large countries and their larger systems are the ones that are doing the selection and choosing the best profiles of migrants, in line with their needs and aspirations, while, at the same time, the systemic weakening of the small countries from which the migrants come from is taking place.@@@What do I mean by that?@@@In short, it is difficult to talk about building trust while larger countries and their large systems are taking over the population of smaller countries through migration and simultaneously the smaller countries are emptying out, resulting in the creation of an environment in which poverty develops and any form of economic or social development is completely prevented.@@@Therefore, the possibility of creating the prerequisites for self-sustainable development in smaller countries is under attack.@@@From the point of view of my country.@@@Bosnia and Herzegovina, it is very easy to provide additional arguments and proof confirming that situation.@@@In my country, there is a significant outflow of the population going to larger and more developed countries, mostly to countries we view as Western democratic countries.@@@While investigating why our people, the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina, decide to leave their country and seek better living conditions in other countries, we came to the conclusion that the fundamental reason for their departure is their belief that there is a lack of prospects in Bosnia and Herzegovina.@@@When we considered what our people referred to in terms of the basic shortcomings with regard to the prospects in Bosnia and Herzegovina, we saw that it was specifically the fact that the country’s political system is not a complete democracy, but rather a form of ethnocracy or a system in which elections for Government institutions, the exercise of power and the distribution of jobs in the State, even in the real sector, are primarily based on membership of a particular ethnicity as a prerequisite.@@@In such a system, one usually does not have the best people in key positions — people who, with their knowledge and abilities, can build a political, economic and social system in Bosnia and Herzegovina, for example.@@@On the contrary, you have ethnically and politically suitable staff who can hardly be expected to lead the overall progress of the country.@@@That value system has been in place for a very long time.@@@In such a system, the key jobs are not performed by the best and most qualified people, but by the politically and ethnically suitable ones.@@@The current political system in Bosnia and Herzegovina, based exclusively on ethnic and then on political affiliation, completely degrades democracy as an important principle for creating an environment with equal opportunities for all people.@@@Such a system, which guarantees participation in Government to certain political actors and their ethnically based political parties, has the form of former and current totalitarian systems, in which power is exercised in an autocratic manner through autocratically inspired political actors.@@@As a result of that unfinished political system, the development of the country is slow, and such politics obstruct what, in my opinion, is one of the key goals of my country — its path to membership 
in larger supranational systems, such as the European Union or NATO.@@@The irremovability or particularly difficult replaceability of the authorities creates such an environment where even the authorities themselves no longer work for the benefit of their citizens, because they feel that there is no need to do so.@@@The distribution of political and social power is already guaranteed to them in advance by the system itself, a system based on ethnicity.@@@Our current political system is skilfully used by our Eastern and Western neighbours and by ethnic communities in Bosnia and Herzegovina, to which they claim national rights.@@@They are running Bosnia and Herzegovina not with the primary aim of helping the members of those ethnic communities, but with the aim of dividing Bosnia and Herzegovina or making it meaningless as a State.@@@Our two neighbours, through the ethnic communities in Bosnia and Herzegovina to which they strive to claim every right, even 27 years after the aggression they carried out over Bosnia and Herzegovina, are in that manner attacking the sovereignty of our country, which makes it almost impossible to develop the democracy of Bosnia and Herzegovina.@@@That practice also violates the minimum of inter-State trust because, unfortunately, our neighbours are not sincerely investing energy with the goal of building inter-State cooperation but are rather investing energy in weakening our State.@@@One can see that this a problem, and it extends to the entire region of the Western Balkans, where there are different ideas, plans and intentions to change the internationally recognized borders and to reorganize the region into something that has no connection with democracy.@@@For such activities and policies, neighbouring countries very often have, at first glance, surprising and unexpected support from countries that we consider to be democratic liberal States and societies, but certainly also from those that are not democratic and that we recognize today as aggressor States with authoritarian regimes.@@@Regretfully, there are many, both in the East and the West, who believe that their barely hidden support for those who want to completely control and ultimately divide Bosnia and Herzegovina will bring stability to the Western Balkans.@@@We, who represent the State of Bosnia and Herzegovina at the United Nations, believe that this will not bring about stability or progress in the Western Balkans.@@@Our neighbours cannot divide Bosnia and Herzegovina among themselves without entering into mutual conflict.@@@We will certainly not allow the division and disappearance of our thousand-year-old State at any cost no matter what anyone thinks about it.@@@That is why we believe that it is in the interest of the United Nations, if peace is to be preserved in the Western Balkans, to support the State of Bosnia and Herzegovina and its institutions.@@@If the United Nations wishes to preserve peace in the Western Balkans, then it should support those who have not violated democratic and civilizational norms, have not committed genocide, were not part of joint criminal enterprises, did not destroy people’s lives due to their ethnicity, did not destroy other people’s temples or shrines and did not advocate revanchism or revenge.@@@If such support is absent, then the responsibility and blame for destabilization does not lie with us, who will certainly not calmly and idly observe a new attempt to destroy our Bosnia and Herzegovina.@@@However, the fundamental problem of Bosnia and Herzegovina lies in the inequality of citizens within the political and electoral system, the result of which is a system of ethnic governance in the country, a system that is destined to be conflictual, in itself.@@@In addition, the ethnic system of exercising power in my country continuously creates space for nepotism and corruption in all segments of society, especially in Government institutions.@@@As a consequence of the ethnic system of exercising power, we have nepotism in the selection of people to perform the most important political and economic jobs.@@@The ethnic political system in my country generates and encourages nepotism and corruption the most, and nepotism and corruption are the elements that are most harmful to social cohesion and trust within a society.@@@That is why, for decades, we have not been able to create a society of equals and, with that, a society of equal opportunities, because employment through family connections and corruption pertaining to the most important positions make one lose hope in positive future prospects.@@@In that connection, allow me to ask an important question — how is it possible to build and achieve trust that will lead to achieving prerequisites for development when we do not actually have enough democracy in our country, when our right to democracy is being taken away and when an embargo to democracy is being imposed upon us, thus generating great uncertainty 
among citizens and often prompting them to leave the country?
The latest interventions of the international representatives of Bosnia and Herzegovina, such as that of the High Representative, through legal violence and the suspension of the entity Constitution for 24 hours, which is an inconceivable precedent in the democratic world, did not remove obstacles to the normal functioning of the State, but rather strengthened the undemocratic ethnic principle and deepened the discrimination of citizens in the Constitution and the electoral law.@@@Democracy is the most important segment for building trust, both in our countries and globally.@@@In order to create the prerequisites for self-sustainable development, it is very important that transitions in societies from former totalitarian, autocratic systems to systems based on full democracy end as soon as possible.@@@We therefore expect the support of actors from the international community, even though they occasionally resort to undemocratic tools for their own interests, like completely denying the possibility of developing democracy in Bosnia and Herzegovina.@@@Of course, we are fully aware that there are a number of United Nations Member States whose history and historical context make them uninterested in democracy and its development.@@@On the other hand, some indicators tell us that over two thirds of the Member States are oriented towards democracy and its development.@@@My point of view is therefore oriented in that direction.@@@I wish to add another important element that is indispensable in building trust for self-sustainable development — creating a system of full human rights, which ultimately offers a society of equality among people and citizens and, therefore, of equal opportunities, with possibilities for everyone.@@@Without a system of equals, it will be difficult to build trust in such a system, especially in a still postwar society, such as Bosnia and Herzegovina.@@@That is particularly true, considering that our society has suffered aggression from our western and eastern neighbouring countries, a direct consequence of which were atrocious war crimes and even the crime of genocide.@@@Such scenarios for Bosnia and Herzegovina continue to be implemented, through political means this time, in times of peace, while continuously asking for support from various parts of the international community.@@@At the same time, regardless of the aforementioned scenarios, our obligation is to create internal prerequisites for building a society of equal people and equal citizens as one of the basic tools that will enable us to avoid future conflicts.@@@Contained within the judgments of the eminent courts that deal with the protection of human rights, such as the European Court of Human Rights, there is a valuable resource for building a stable society in which the risk of internal conflict is reduced to a minimum.@@@But those judgments also take away an effective mechanism for violating the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina from the hands of potentially aggressive politics of the neighbouring countries.@@@In short, that means that we, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, will have to change the entire societal paradigm and shift from ethnic political representation to civic political representation, which is the standard in the democratic world.@@@We must use this opportunity to draw the attention of the United Nations to something that, in my opinion — and I am sorry to say this — is the very uncivilized stance of the Government and the Prime Minister of our neighbouring country, which have rejected the latest judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the Kovacevic case and have defended the very principles rejected in said judgment, such as the political principle of legitimate representation based on ethnicity, which is a generator of inequality among the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina and a means by which the neighbours undermine the State of Bosnia and Herzegovina.@@@That was done in such a way that it could be qualified as interference in the internal affairs of Bosnia and Herzegovina.@@@Disregard for the judgments of international courts, as voiced by the Prime Minister of a neighbouring country, is reminiscent of the attitudes towards international law that Vladimir Putin has adopted in the case of Ukraine.@@@However, this is not only about having a negative attitude towards the international standards of the United Nations, but also about a neighbour-led policy towards Bosnia and Herzegovina.@@@Only when civic political representation is accepted in Bosnia and Herzegovina, through the implementation of the 
judgments of the European Court of Human Rights and when, in parallel, the neighbourhood attacks on the sovereignty of the country stop — only then will we be able to participate in projects, such as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, in our full capacity and more efficiently as an equal participant and actor of all planned activities.@@@When that time comes, we, as a country, will be ready and equipped to take on all challenges related to self-sustainable development, to build our mutual social trust as a society of equals and to be an active participant in building trust on a global level.@@@I believe everyone shares my opinion that, in societies dominated by inequality, one cannot be a meaningful participant in promoting ideas of self-sustainable development through building trust and global solidarity for all.@@@First, we must reform our society so that it can understand the importance of solidarity for everyone, with a system that provides full equality and offers solidarity towards others on an equal footing.@@@In the conclusion of this address.@@@I would like to emphasize that Bosnia and Herzegovina will actively work on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@We will work on building trust and solidarity for all.@@@By rejecting the discriminatory ethnic concept, we are simultaneously rejecting a system dominated by nepotism and corruption and thus bring our society into the ranks of democratic and mature societies.@@@Then we will become a society and a country that can actively participate in world processes, based on the fundamental principles on which the current world order and what we call the international community.@@@The transition process of our society can and should be relatively short, because the equality of all people is the basic premise of every modern democratic society.@@@In that respect we count on the support of that part of the international community that can help us to that end.@@@I am aware of the existence of other parts of the international community, which for their own geopolitical reasons will offer resistance in order to keep Bosnia and Herzegovina and the entire region of the Western Balkans in a continuous state of destabilization and tension.@@@Such people do not want democracy, but rather ethnocracy, disorder and violence.@@@Lastly.@@@I can say with certainty that Bosnia and Herzegovina has become a place in which democracy and its values are defended.@@@And there are only two sides in that regard — one that is in favour of democracy and its values and the other that is opposed to democracy because its goal is the establishment of autocratic systems that are undemocratic in character.@@@First of all.@@@I would like to congratulate the heads and members of delegations and other participants on the opening of the seventy-eighth session of the General Assembly, and I wish them productive work.@@@I would also like to congratulate Mr. Dennis Francis on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session.@@@Today a high responsibility should unite all States Members of the United Nations.@@@Each of them should have, and has, the means to significantly contribute to tackling the tasks of the United Nations.@@@The current world faces very serious challenges for various reasons.@@@Despite their differences in appearance, they all influence the course of inter-State relations to a greater or lesser extent and often negatively influence the implementation of agreed plans and programmes in key areas of the global agenda.@@@That, in turn, may lead to the lowering of the very foundation of global security as a principle of the United Nations, which should not be allowed.@@@Over several years.@@@Turkmenistan has therefore firmly and persistently upheld the principle of the unity of security and its integrity.@@@We are convinced that military and political security should not be considered separately from economic, ecological, energy, transport, food, biological and information security.@@@None of those areas that I mentioned can be secondary or irrelevant, and their solutions cannot be postponed.@@@I think that the main challenge of the United Nations is to provide an integral approach to the security challenge, mobilize the current experience, competence, ideas and initiatives of Member States in a constructive manner and step back from short-term gains to attain truly crucial goals that will provide lasting peace, security and development over the long term.@@@That can be achieved only collectively and with the United Nations in the leading role.@@@Amid the discussions on the role of the United Nations in the current world and suggestions to reform it, it is a fact that there is no alternative to the United Nations.@@@From the day of its establishment, the United Nations has stood as the only universal and legitimate Organization responsible for peacekeeping and for providing global and comprehensive security and a stable modern structure of inter-State relations.@@@That is the principled position of Turkmenistan.@@@For that reason, we must consistently and persistently make use the potential of this global Organization and its political and diplomatic tools and moral authority in order to make a balanced, non-ideological assessment of the current events and trends, to overcome the distrust and confrontational tension in world politics and try to indicate perspectives for compromise and the consideration of mutual interests.@@@That is possible only in an open and genuine dialogue under the auspices of the United Nations.@@@We are aware that achieving that kind of dialogue will not be easy; however, it is necessary.@@@In that regard.@@@Turkmenistan proposes beginning to discuss opportunities for the development of a global security strategy based on the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the universal standards of international law, considering the current realities and trends in global development.@@@In our opinion, such a strategy should reflect the existence of the new risk factors that recently appeared, along with the traditional ones.@@@We also consider it necessary to include a number of areas of the United Nations in it, in particular preventive diplomacy as an instrument to prevent and diffuse conflicts, usage of the potential of neutrality for the peaceful, political and diplomatic settlement of disputes and controversies and the restoration of a structure of trustful dialogue, based on the decisions of the General Assembly in declaring 2021 the International Year of Peace and Trust and 2023 the International Year of Dialogue as a Guarantee of Peace.@@@Time has confirmed the relevance of those resolutions in the current situation.@@@In order to achieve global and comprehensive security.@@@Turkmenistan bases its position on the need to give a pronounced regional context to the work of the United Nations.@@@We conclude that such an approach aims to contribute sufficient specificity and to increase functionality and effectiveness.@@@I am convinced that the time has come to launch an inclusive, comprehensive and systemic dialogue between Central Asia and the United Nations.@@@Turkmenistan respectfully invites partners to join its initiative.@@@In that regard, our country is taking the initiative to create the format of the Conference on Security in Central Asia 
and Bordering Areas under the auspices of the United Nations.@@@The goal of the conference is the development of approaches and decisions aimed at aligning and synchronizing the efforts of the Central Asian States and the global community, international organizations and financial and economic institutions to provide stable, conflict-free development of the region.@@@We express our readiness to host the first conference in Ashgabat in 2024.@@@Turkmenistan considers the addressing of urgent climate and ecological issues to be among the key areas of the work of the United Nations in the coming years.@@@Among those, we highlight the issues related to the Global Methane Pledge.@@@I must say that, with joining the Paris Agreement on Climate Change in 2017, a number of relevant national programmes were adopted in our country.@@@National events aimed at reducing and eliminating the negative effects of methane emissions into the atmosphere are being held.@@@We are primarily talking about the phased implementation and use of modern, green and resource-saving technologies, mainly in the areas of energy, industry and transport.@@@At the same time, we welcome the efforts of the world community towards realizing the Global Methane Pledge.@@@Of course, we expect substantive cooperation and targeted assistance from the specialized agencies of the United Nations.@@@States Members of the Organization and other interested partners.@@@In that context, the road map for the development of international cooperation aimed at studying Turkmenistan’s joining of the Global Methane Pledge was recently approved.@@@We will soon send that document to the Secretariat.@@@Overall.@@@I believe that the time has come for the United Nations to pay close and effective attention to ecological issues in Central Asia, work on certain delays in addressing them and begin taking targeted and specific actions to create a coherent ecological United Nations strategy regarding the region, with a population of nearly 80 million people, covering a vast area with its unique natural resources and biodiversity, while, at the same time, being located in a region with serious ecological risks.@@@As a significant step in taking a strategic approach to the ecological issues of Central Asia.@@@Turkmenistan proposes the establishment of a specialized agency, the regional centre for technologies related to climate change in Central Asia, which will substantively and systematically work on the topic of climate.@@@We are ready to offer organizational and technical terms for the functioning of such a centre in the capital city of Turkmenistan.@@@Ashgabat.@@@The Central Asia region adjoins the Caspian Sea.@@@Everyone is aware of the importance of that lake, with its unique natural system in the context of the global ecological agenda.@@@As a result of the active and respectful long-term cooperation of coastal countries, the key principles of a policy on the Caspian Sea were developed, including the Convention on the Legal Status of the Caspian Sea.@@@Last summer, at the sixth Caspian Summit, held in Turkmenistan, all the participants strongly affirmed their readiness for close cooperation on ecological issues.@@@I believe that that provides a good opportunity for the beginning of the broad, systemic interaction of coastal countries with the United Nations.@@@In that regard.@@@Turkmenistan proposes the creation of the Caspian ecology initiative, which seeks to become a platform for substantive and professional interaction on a wide range of issues associated with the environmental protection of the Caspian Sea, preserving its biological resources and tackling several pressing ecological issues.@@@We think that the realization of that initiative should be accomplished in close cooperation with the United Nations and its agencies and institutions.@@@As a responsible State Member of the United Nations.@@@Turkmenistan clearly formulates and implements its own approaches and actions by defining priorities that will make a tangible contribution and serve for the benefit of global goals, facilitating their early achievement.@@@Among those priorities, we highlight the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the area of transport.@@@As Member States know.@@@Turkmenistan initiated the establishment of effective international platforms in that important area.@@@Let me mention the first-ever Global Sustainable Transport Conference, which was successfully held in Ashgabat in 2016, as well as the Ministerial Meeting of Landlocked Developing Countries on Trade and Transport, which was organized last summer in Turkmenistan in cooperation with the United Nations.@@@We are proud that Turkmenistan’s purposeful work was marked by the adoption in recent years by the General Assembly of six resolutions on transport, which were initiated by our country.@@@Among the recent 
ones is resolution 77/286, entitled “World Sustainable Transport Day”, which was adopted in May.@@@We thank all Member States for their support of the document.@@@In that regard, based on the provisions of that resolution.@@@Turkmenistan is proposing to convene a high-level meeting during the current session on the occasion of World Sustainable Transport Day.@@@We hope for the assistance of the relevant United Nations agencies in organizing that event in New York.@@@An important area of Turkmenistan’s work in achieving the SDGs is maximizing assistance to the United Nations in addressing the food issue.@@@The coronavirus disease, along with other adverse factors, has exposed the weakness of countries where that issue has not been resolved and where the population does not receive proper nutrition.@@@Unity, integrity and determination are necessary when addressing issues related to access to food resources for countries and regions.@@@Guaranteed proper nutrition is an integral part of human rights and a key factor in health and normal physical development, especially for children.@@@It is obvious that that requires ground-breaking decisions and new approaches that overcome political, ideological and cross-cutting barriers.@@@Consequently.@@@Turkmenistan proposes an initiative to convene a major international forum on food security in cooperation with the World Food Programme, the World Health Organization and UNICEF and under the auspices of the United Nations.@@@We express our readiness to provide conditions for holding such an event in the capital city of Turkmenistan within the agreed time frame.@@@Next year, in Turkmenistan and far beyond its border, including at the United Nations, we will celebrate the 300th anniversary of the prominent son of the Turkmen nation — poet, philosopher and public figure Magtymguly Pyragy.@@@All humankind honours his memory and pays due respect to that great humanitarian, who highly contributed not only to world literature but also to the development of Eastern civilization and to that of the whole world.@@@I would like to conclude with an excerpt from the poem of Magtymguly entitled “Humankind”, in which he addresses his fellows and descendants in these life-affirming lines: “Whether asleep or awake, he will always keep in his mind whatever work is chosen by humankind”.@@@Let loyalty to creative thoughts and the ideals of peace, justice and progress serve as the main and clear guide in our joint work.@@@Let me begin by extending sympathy to all nations experiencing loss of life due to the recent natural disasters.@@@May the souls of all the faithful departed rest in perfect peace.@@@I am honoured to address the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session on behalf of the Government and the people of the Republic of Liberia.@@@I congratulate His Excellency Mr. Dennis Francis on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session, trusting that he will bring his wealth of experience to bear on the work of the Assembly.@@@I wish to assure him of my delegation’s full support as he steers the work of the Assembly successfully, in fulfilment of the expectations and confidence reposed in him.@@@Let me use this occasion to also congratulate his predecessor.@@@His Excellency Mr. Csaba Korosi, on the capable manner in which he administered the affairs of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session.@@@Let me also commend His Excellency Mr. Antonio Guterres, the Secretary-General, for the astute manner in which he continues to administer the affairs of the United Nations in these difficult and challenging times.@@@His foresight, commitment and dedication have kept the United Nations firmly on course.@@@We have convened at a time when the world faces many challenges: security, social, economic and political, as well as natural disasters.@@@We must exert collective efforts to confront those challenges, with a view to resolving them in order to bring about a safer, secure and prosperous future.@@@We must continue to promote global solidarity and rebuild trust in accelerating progress on the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).@@@The SDGs, by design, require bilateral and multilateral collaboration to achieve the results that we seek.@@@The theme of this year’s debate.@@@“Rebuilding trust and reigniting global solidarity: accelerating action on the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals towards peace, prosperity, progress and sustainability for all.”@@@adequately captures our current global demands.@@@There is a critical need to ensure that development assistance is aligned with SDG projects.@@@That is why my delegation welcomes and supports the Secretary-General’s agenda of action to accelerate the implementation of existing agreements, including the Sustainable Development Goals, and to re-embrace global solidarity and find new ways to work together for the common good of humankind.@@@As the world deals with unprecedented global political and security challenges, there are growing concerns about the proliferation of non-State armed actors, threats of nuclear escalation and extreme climate conditions.@@@Those challenges continue to serve as obstacles to our quest for a safe and peaceful world.@@@Achieving the 2030 vision involves ensuring that the journey is secured through accountability and mutual understanding.@@@Liberia is committed to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the SDGs; they are in line with our flagship national development plan — the Pro-Poor Agenda for Prosperity and Development, which reflects our resolve to achieve peace and prosperity while addressing the structural impediments to economic growth and national development.@@@The slowdown in global economic growth continues to be a challenge.@@@Over the past 12 months.@@@Liberia has made progress in areas ranging from health to education, gender equality and infrastructure development.@@@We are proud of our achievements in reducing maternal mortality rates, increasing gender parity in school enrolment and elevating our overall health and well-being.@@@Liberia appreciates the fact that this body has once again directed its attention to issues of global health, as demonstrated by the number of high-level meetings to keep that critical issue on our collective agenda.@@@We emphasize unity of purpose as we address challenges that involve the provision of basic services to all people.@@@Given that more than 60 per cent of Liberia’s population is composed of young people, the future of our nation rests on their shoulders.@@@Understanding that immense responsibility, we are committed to continue paving the way for their growth and development.@@@Cognizant of the fact that structural transformation drives prosperity, we are focused on infrastructure development, with roads and energy playing a critical part.@@@Thanks to the support of our many partners, we remain unwavering in our commitment to explore means to further the implementation of the Sustainable 
Development Goals, as it represents the road map towards prosperity.@@@I support Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’s proposed SDG Stimulus plan and call for the actualization of $500 billion per year in order to boost sustainable development for developing countries through tackling the high cost of debt and the rising risk of debt distress; the scaling up of affordable longterm financing for development; and the expansion of contingency financing to countries in need.@@@Liberia profoundly appreciates the continued engagement and support of the United Nations system in consolidating its peace and in its efforts to address emerging challenges.@@@Liberia will continue to cooperate and collaborate with the United Nations as it continues to rebuild and strengthen its institutions and infrastructure.@@@Five years ago, on the occasion of my first address to the General Assembly (see A/73/PV.8), we informed members about the peaceful democratic transition that had just taken place in Liberia.@@@With the support of the United Nations and that of our friends, we have kept the democratic torch burning.@@@We have maintained peace and security.@@@We have protected human rights and the right of the media to operate peacefully and freely.@@@The Liberian people have enjoyed the full exercise of their constitutional rights.@@@The country is well on course to consolidate its democratic credentials.@@@I am pleased to inform the Assembly once again that in a few weeks Liberians will go to the polls, in keeping with the Liberian Constitution, to vote in our scheduled presidential and legislative elections.@@@The October polls will mark the fourth peaceful general elections in Liberia since the end of the civil war in 2003.@@@This seventy-eighth session is taking place at a time when my country is preparing for the first elections since the withdrawal of the United Nations peacekeeping presence from Liberia.@@@The 10 October election is an opportunity to sustain the gains made in our reconstruction and development processes.@@@The Government of Liberia has taken all measures necessary to ensure free, fair, transparent, peaceful, inclusive and credible elections.@@@The National Elections Commission has been strengthened to ensure that it operates without undue influence.@@@In addition, political parties have committed themselves to a non-violent electoral process by signing the 2023 Farmington River Declaration, which obligates all actors in the elections to continue to promote peace.@@@Let me, as a strong believer in democracy, reiterate my call for respect for constitutional governance and respect for the will of the people.@@@While addressing the issue of elections and democracy, permit me to congratulate all democratically elected leaders around the world.@@@Our world is also under threat from natural calamities, as seen in extreme climate conditions globally.@@@It is therefore our collective responsibility to urgently prioritize addressing the climate crisis as we strive to reach a target of a 64 per cent reduction in carbon emissions.@@@There remains a need to prioritize support to countries, including Liberia, that have the capacity to use their biodiversity in building resilience against the changing climate.@@@The United Nations has always been confronted with challenges and has stood the test of time.@@@Hence, these, too, will pass.@@@I wish to thank the Secretary-General for his New Agenda for Peace.@@@Liberia is in solidarity with the bold steps needed to address the triple crises of disruption, biodiversity loss and pollution that are destroying our planet.@@@Liberia is hopeful that concrete global action towards the attainment of the goals of Our Common Agenda (A/75/982) will be achieved.@@@Liberia’s journey is best captured in the spirit of unity, resilience and ambition.@@@Together, through collaboration and with a shared purpose, we can, and must, shape a world that upholds the rights and dignity of every individual.@@@In alliance with our United Nations family.@@@Liberia remains resolute in its commitment.@@@We pledge to protect our planet, promote peace and prevent conflicts.@@@We vow to ensure sustainable financing and amplify our partnerships, reflecting our shared determination for a brighter future.@@@We must also accept that that can be achieved only through collaboration between and among Governments, non-governmental stakeholders and other partners, which will guarantee transparency, accountability, good governance and the inclusion of all citizens in the decision-making process.@@@Let us remind ourselves that our collective strength lies in our unity.@@@Together we can overcome any challenge; rebuild trust; promote peace and religious tolerance; uphold the tenets of democracy and the rule of law; support women’s participation; encourage diplomacy and strengthen global solidarity.@@@Allow me first to express my warmest congratulations to Mr. Dennis Francis on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session.@@@I am indeed honoured to convey the following message of President Isaias Afwerki to the Assembly.@@@Seventy-eight years have elapsed since the historic establishment of the United Nations, on 24 October 1945.@@@That historic event occurred on the ashes and in the aftermath of the Second World War, which caused unprecedented loss of life and devastation to humankind.@@@Unfortunately, the poignant lessons drawn from that ferocious war did not usher in an era of enduring peace rooted in legality, justice and sustainable equilibrium in global terms.@@@The cold war, which lasted for the subsequent 45 years, gave rise to a spiral of incessant conflicts and instability in many parts of the world, with all its detrimental consequences for enduring and inclusive prosperity.@@@More ominously, the futile attempts to impose a unipolar world order in the last 30 years or so, in particular the crises spawned in those times aimed at reviving defunct alliances and military blocs, are increasingly pushing our global community towards the precipice of a much more perilous catastrophe.@@@Within that calamitous global reality, the African continent has been, and remains, marginalized, compelled as it is to shoulder the brunt of those destructive policies.@@@From that perspective, it must be recognized that the resistance movements unfolding in Africa — manifested in different variants — are expressions and a continuation of the struggle against colonialism.@@@They are defiant reactions to modern slavery, unremitting plunder and domination.@@@Another dimension that is often glossed over is the fact that Al-Qaida.@@@Da’esh.@@@Al-Shabaab and other offshoots and franchise terrorist groups are criminal enterprises propped up and funded by the same forces of domination for political ends.@@@They are ruthlessly instrumentalized to foment crises and provide plausible pretexts for military intervention.@@@I have dwelt at some length on the legacy of the acts of destabilization unleashed by the forces of hegemony because my country has not been spared their fallout within the overall global context.@@@I am not referring to the distant past or the 1950s, in which Eritrea’s inalienable right to decolonization was sacrificed on the altar of the geostrategic interests of those Powers.@@@We must recognize that the sanctions imposed on Eritrea from 2009 until 2018 were another recent act of transgression and deceit that requires full redress and accountability.@@@Vigorous and persistent resistance — even if amorphous — by the peoples of the world have deterred the emergence and prevalence of the intended unipolar world order for global domination and hegemony.@@@The vibrant trend— the invigorated resistance movements that are mushrooming in different parts of the world — indicate that we are on the cusp or threshold of a new reality, a historic crossroads that will augur a new world order.@@@Obviously, that will not transpire tomorrow.@@@Though inexorable, the path will not be easy or attainable in a short span of time.@@@But there is no doubt whatsoever that that destiny will ultimately be fulfilled.@@@The new desired global order will have to be accompanied and cemented by far-reaching structural changes in the global governance architecture as well as various international and regional organizations An avoidable pitfall in that indispensable collective effort would be a tendency to cosmetic and nominal measures that would only engender false hope and apathy among the peoples and countries of the world that seek and aspire to genuine changes aimed at bringing about enduring peace, stability and prosperity.@@@In tandem, the United Nations will be impelled to undergo the requisite structural changes and profound reforms.@@@The desired changes will, hopefully, be commensurate with the aspirations to justice and the rule of law; respect for national independence and sovereignty; and the advent of a new epoch of genuine partnership and shared prosperity.@@@As the principal international platform, the United Nations must indeed be elevated - in terms of structure and mandate - to a cherished umbrella organization that can fulfil its historic mandate with efficacy and potency.@@@From that perspective, the much-vaunted reform of the Security Council should not be perceived as nominal tampering that is limited to merely increasing the number and geographical representation of new members.@@@The architecture of veto power and other institutional distortions that incapacitate the Security Council and prevent it from exercising its responsibilities on the basis of international law with impartiality and objectivity must be examined, with its historical track record as a guiding template.@@@Members will agree with me that political horse-trading and the misuse of Security Council membership to advance narrow national interests are not compatible with the solemn responsibilities that they are entrusted with and that are expressly stipulated in the Charter of the United Nations.@@@The criteria for membership should not be confined to or determined by mere political and economic clout, population size or other factors.@@@Membership in the Security Council must reflect the wide spectrum of Member States in the United Nations.@@@In that spirit, we hope that the deliberations of the General Assembly this year and in the period ahead will examine those and other associated complex parameters in all their dimensions and depth.@@@It is my true honour to be in this great Hall today and to address the General Assembly on behalf of Montenegro.@@@This year’s general debate theme depicts the key challenge lying before the United Nations as the rebuilding of trust and global solidarity.@@@It also accelerates action on the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda.@@@Indeed, achieving a sustainable and peaceful future requires our full attention and demonstrates our true commitment to a better world.@@@I reaffirm and reiterate Montenegro’s strong support and commitment to the goals and principles of the United Nations, particularly in times like these, when global unity and solidarity are greatly needed.@@@To efficiently address global problems, we need wise leadership.@@@Rather than uniting in joint efforts, most often we share only our joint concerns.@@@Yet, the only way of tackling widespread crises is to be united in action.@@@I believe that we can all agree that the ongoing geopolitical crisis represents a grave challenge to international peace and security and an alarming indicator of the need to fully return to the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations and to respect its binding character and the universality of its goals and 
principles — civilizational values on which the rules- based world order rests.@@@I assumed the position of President of Montenegro just four months ago, after our citizens made a resounding choice for change in the recent election.@@@That marks an unprecedented level of support for a new era of our country's democratic development.@@@It leaves me in no doubt about the political direction our citizens want to see: strengthening the rule of law, developing prosperity and ensuring social cohesion and equal opportunities.@@@I am highly aware of how vital those objectives are in safeguarding our young democracy and freedom, especially at a time when de-democratization processes are becoming increasingly apparent worldwide.@@@Let me particularly emphasize the importance of the rule of law as the key to unlock the economic potential and improve the living standards.@@@Building truly democratic and independent institutions is crucial along that path.@@@We are therefore committed to a zero tolerance on corruption and organized crime.@@@To better achieve our wider policy goals, we base our foreign policy on three key pillars: first, accelerating our integration into the European Union (EU); secondly, further strengthening the credibility of Montenegro as a NATO member; and thirdly, fostering the best possible relations with all our neighbours in the Balkans.@@@Montenegro is devoted to safeguarding lasting peace in the Balkans.@@@Therefore.@@@I have commenced my term by strengthening our friendships with our Balkan neighbours.@@@We have also intensified the discussion with the European Union, thus extensively elaborating on the need for Montenegro’s speedy accession to the EU as the best possible signal to all other aspiring states that the EU perspective is still alive.@@@Following those principles, in the four months of my mandate, we have opened a meaningful dialogue with civil society and vulnerable communities with the aim of pursuing and ultimately achieving a truly inclusive society where nobody is left behind.@@@Creating an environment of equal opportunities where life success is primarily determined by education and hard work is my goal.@@@That is my story, which I believe can become and should become the story of Montenegro and the story of all of us.@@@I belong to a generation that was too young to witness the suffering caused by the wars that followed the dissolution of Yugoslavia, yet I think that I bear no less obligation to work on diminishing the still present consequences and thus preventing such tragic events from occurring again.@@@To that end.@@@Montenegro's strong commitment is to address the past without bias by calling things as they are, as the victims of those tragic events expect them to be called.@@@Notwithstanding the fact that we in Montenegro, as in many other democratic countries, often diverge on many political issues, we all agree that peace and prosperity, an equal and just society and friendly relations, particularly with our neighbours, have no alternative.@@@We are proud of our democracy, but also grateful to our ancestors for having a State to protect and promote our interests abroad.@@@We truly cherish freedom, and we stand united in that.@@@The same is what we hope from the world — to be united as ever before in defending democracy, human rights, freedom of choice and the rule of law, ensuring peace and prosperity, but above all, preserving human lives.@@@In that context.@@@I would like to reaffirm Montenegro’s clear-cut position in condemning Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified aggression and our firm support for Ukraine.@@@Besides devastating Ukraine, the war has caused an energy, food, and financial crisis that has especially harmed the least developed countries in the world.@@@To that extent, and in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the relevant General Assembly resolutions, we share the desire for comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Ukraine.@@@There are still far too many places in our world where peace, stability, human rights and even basic necessities are not granted.@@@We cannot be proud of that.@@@The international community often emphasizes reactionary humanitarian responses rather than preventive ones.@@@We need only think of the heartbreaking migratory crisis in the Mediterranean region.@@@The confluence of challenges we all face today serves as a formidable obstacle to the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).@@@Despite those obstacles, there are constructive ways to move forward.@@@To speed up progress towards achieving the SDGs, it is necessary to mobilize strong political commitment, improve financial resources and achieve closer cooperation.@@@I believe that we should be honest and admit that the Sustainable Development Goals have proven to be a greater challenge than initially expected.@@@requiring from all our countries additional and greater engagement and commitment.@@@The international community must increase its efforts to combat climate change with concrete actions.@@@That includes the full implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and addressing the interconnected crises of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution.@@@By adopting the Rio Declaration in 1992.@@@Montenegro became the world’s first ecological State.@@@The Declaration defined Montenegrin strategic commitment to adopting and implementing the highest standards and norms in the field of environmental protection, nature conservation and sustainable development.@@@We are proud of the fact that we were among the first countries to bring the SDGs commitment into the national framework through our Strategy of Sustainable Development.@@@Another major step towards speeding up the implementation of the 2030 Development Agenda has been the establishment of the country’s SDG Acceleration Fund.@@@One particularly important fiscal and labour market reform resulted in the rise of the minimum wage and minimum pension.@@@That was followed by other social security reforms, including the provision of free books to primary school students as well as a child allowance to all under 18.@@@All those measures supported an environment of equal opportunities, thereby tackling one problem that was present in country for a long time — inequality.@@@In the spirit of the seventy-fifth anniversary of the landmark Universal Declaration of Human Rights.@@@Montenegro confirms its strong commitment to respecting, protecting and promoting human rights.@@@As a member of the Human Rights Council from 2022 to 2024, we are determined to further strengthen the role of that pivotal international forum in responding to situations of serious human rights violations and preserving the universality of international human rights law and the independence of the United Nations human rights system.@@@Montenegro, as a secular State, takes great pride in our diverse and inclusive society, embracing various cultures and religions.@@@Our notable achievement lies in fostering a harmonious and inclusive political environment.@@@I am convinced that, in the near future, even the smallest minority groups, such as the Roma population, will secure their seats in the national Parliament.@@@We also call for a global response to the refugee and migrant crisis.@@@In that regard, we must share the responsibilities we assumed in the global agreements we have adopted.@@@We must cooperate in finding solutions and helping countries of destination, as well as countries of origin.@@@Allow me to recall that Montenegro gave shelter to over 100.000 refugees and displaced persons during the wars in the former Yugoslavia, amounting to more than 20 per cent of our entire population.@@@Also today, we have opened our doors to the biggest number of Ukrainian refugees per capita in Europe.@@@Let me emphasize that the protection of refugees, including their legal status and our decision to provide them with shelter as they flee devastating conflicts, has received unanimous support from the entire political spectrum.@@@Moreover.@@@Montenegrin society stands united in its commitment to upholding international law in that regard, even in the face of significant social pressure on our health care and education infrastructure.@@@Montenegro is firmly committed and determined to actively and constructively contribute and support collective efforts to preserve world peace and security.@@@We strongly advocate for the role and work of United Nations peacekeeping missions.@@@To that end, we will continue to strongly support a larger presence of Montenegrin military forces in peace missions under the auspices of the United Nations.@@@We very much welcome the New Agenda for Peace, in which the Secretary-General outlines the very founding stones on which we should rebuild the new international system based on trust and solidarity.@@@Montenegro remains determined on the course of a Euro-Atlantic future, good-neighbourly relations and multilateralism.@@@With that in mind, we have launched our candidacy for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for the period 2026-2027.@@@We ask for members’ support.@@@To conclude, as a European country, not only geographically but, more important, in terms of values and principles, we are convinced that the EU accession of Montenegro, as well as of the entire Western Balkan region, will further strengthen our position against the malicious influences of third parties, and ensure lasting peace and prosperity.@@@Hence, the accession of Montenegro to the EU is not only a story significant for Montenegro itself, but would also provide a positive example to all aspiring countries, from the Balkans all the way to the east of Europe, that EU enlargement is alive and still possible.@@@I would like to extend my greetings to you on behalf of the people of Cabo Verde.@@@Mr. President.@@@We have engaged in this session’s general debate with a view to accelerating action on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).@@@The theme of the general debate must indeed mobilize nations towards peace, prosperity, progress and sustainability for all.@@@The world has been experiencing periods of intense crisis.@@@We have been seeing a resurgence of populism and extremism, as well as attacks on democracy.@@@There have been successive coups d’etat in African countries.@@@In this difficult time of war in Ukraine.@@@Cabo Verde is on the side of the values and principles of freedom and respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of peoples and nations.@@@Based on those principles and values, we condemn the Russian invasion of Ukraine.@@@In these challenging times caused by instability and successive coups d’etat in various countries of Africa.@@@Cabo Verde supports the principles and values of constitutional liberal democracy.@@@Based on those principles, we condemn the use of such coups as a path to power.@@@A recent Afrobarometer survey shows that two thirds of Africans prefer democracy to any other form of governance, but only 38 per cent are satisfied with how democracy functions in their countries.@@@If, on the one hand, there is a disconnect between citizens and those with political power with respect to the workings of democracy, on the other, there is an opportunity.@@@The preference of our citizens for democracy is an opportunity for greater and better democracy; good governance; greater citizen empowerment; the fight against corruption; fiscal and financial transparency; and for policies based on results that have a real impact on people’s lives and create trust and hope.@@@Credible and trustworthy electoral and judicial systems, freedom of the press, the promotion of pluralism and strong institutions are fundamental to ensuring the trust of political actors and citizens in the rules of democracy.@@@They prevent grave crises 
and extreme conflicts, in addition to strengthening democracy.@@@They are political matters that deserve to be addressed and discussed as a matter of priority by political leaders in order to establish the trust and stability necessary to promote peace, progress, prosperity and sustainability.@@@Cabo Verde is committed to working in a spirit of cooperation and determination alongside all Member States to address insecurity in Africa and the rest of the world.@@@Together, as the United Nations, we can transform that challenge into an opportunity to build a safer world in which peace, stability and prosperity are accessible to all.@@@The world has become increasingly interconnected.@@@The magnitude and severity of the coronavirus disease pandemic showed us that in a context of spreading insecurity that does not recognize borders, no one is safe.@@@Partnerships among nations are key to overcoming threats to global security.@@@We should consider security from a broad-based, global perspective that takes into account health, climate and environmental security in the context of pandemics and climate change; food security and overall security in addressing profound inequalities in access to basic goods such as water, electricity and household sanitation; and security in the face of drug trafficking, terrorism, maritime piracy, human trafficking and cybercrime.@@@We know there is a huge risk that any of those security factors could become endemic.@@@Only through close cooperation, partnerships and solidarity can we create an environment with lasting global security.@@@We must commit to ensuring that conflict prevention and resolution and post-conflict reconstruction are key elements on our path towards achieving the SDGs.@@@The challenges to our ability to achieve the SDGs have increased, but we cannot allow the difficult global context to weaken or end our commitments to the 2030 Agenda.@@@On the contrary, it should encourage us to implement reforms, engage in investment, financing and partnerships and uphold international solidarity.@@@It should encourage us to reform the international financial architecture, operationalize climate and environmental financing instruments, substantially increase special drawing rights, simplify the rules for their issuance and allocation and provide debt relief to the least developed countries.@@@It should encourage us to ensure the fair and meaningful representation of African countries in the community of nations, including on the Security Council and in international financial institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.@@@It should encourage us once and for all to move forward with the normalization of the Multidimensional Vulnerability Index and the international community’s application of it as a benchmark for granting access to low-cost and long-term financing, as well as greater levels of financing, for small island developing States.@@@Development is a long and demanding journey in which countries’ external relations play a decisive role.@@@Development partnerships, and the conditions for financing in particular, are important.@@@But there is one determining factor in that regard.@@@The only way for countries to achieve development is by making strong commitments within their own borders through their Governments, citizens, companies and civil-society organizations.@@@There must be a strong commitment to creating a political, institutional, economic and social environment that encourages citizens, businesses and civil-society organizations to channel their energy, skills and resources towards personal, organizational and collective development.@@@There must also be a strong commitment to ensuring good political, economic, social and environmental governance.@@@In Cabo Verde, we believe that people, institutions and trust are the keys to success.@@@Africa needs expanded growth and better integration into the global economy in order to enable it to engage in production and export, create well- paid jobs, eradicate extreme poverty and ensure the happiness of its peoples.@@@It needs structural transformation to be able to make its many commodity based, low-added-value economies more diversified, with greater integration into value chains and increased competitiveness.@@@It requires transformations in terms of reducing vulnerabilities, increasing resilience and responding to external economic, financial, energy, climate and health shocks.@@@We also need transformation in terms of technological connectivity, which is a major obstacle to Africa’s economic integration.@@@Africa needs to decisively, consistently and effectively invest in human capital, including through quality education and health for all and access to basic needs such as water, electricity and household sanitation for every family.@@@In order to yield significant results, long-term transformative investments require considerable concessionary funding, predictability, scale-up effects and enough time to implement them.@@@The weight of external debt, the levels of sovereign risk and the financing conditions for African countries and 
companies are serious issues that block their pathways to development.@@@They require structured and consistent solutions.@@@We need mechanisms that create virtuous cycles.@@@The conversion of debt into climate and environmental financing is one such mechanism.@@@Such transformations can free up resources for investments that improve resilience, reduce exposure to external shocks, lower carbon emissions, protect biodiversity, create investment opportunities for the private sector and skilled job opportunities for young people.@@@Cabo Verde and Portugal recently signed an agreement to convert bilateral debt into climate and environmental financing to help to achieve those goals.@@@Contributions by additional partners would increase the scale of transformative investments and accelerate their impact.@@@Cabo Verde reaffirms its commitment to achieving the SDGs through integrated policies.@@@Our goal is eradicating extreme poverty by 2026, leaving no one behind in education and accelerating our energy transition.@@@We are investing in reducing our dependence on groundwater sources for agriculture.@@@We want to transform Cabo Verde into a digital nation and diversify our economy.@@@We embrace the 2030 Agenda as our path towards achieving progress, and our second sustainable development plan is geared to that commitment.@@@We reaffirm our firm commitment to realizing the commitments we have just agreed on at the SDG Summit, which are vital for the Decade of Action.@@@They call on us to forge intelligent actions aimed at achieving international peace and security so that we can advance more rapidly towards achieving prosperity, progress and sustainability for all, leaving no one behind.@@@It is a pleasure and a humbling experience to address this audience for the first time.@@@This forum carries great responsibility for the shape of humankind’s future.@@@First and foremost.@@@I see my address as an opportunity to present a vision of how we can coexist and cooperate as nations and global citizens.@@@Czechia aims to play a proactive and responsible role within the global community.@@@No one can cope with current global challenges alone.@@@That is why we strongly support the reforms proposed by the Secretary-General in his report Our Common Agenda (A/75/982).@@@We want to work together on a more effective and inclusive multilateral system that is able to address the needs we face.@@@That is why Czechia has announced its candidacy for non-permanent membership of the Security Council for the term 2032-2033.@@@Last year, a permanent member of the Security Council, one of the founding nations of the Organization, blatantly violated the fundamental principles the United Nations stands upon.@@@The full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine continues to constitute a manifest violation of the Charter of the United Nations and the international law we all subscribed to.@@@My country has its own experience with wars and interventions, including a decades-long military occupation imposed by Moscow.@@@It taught us what it means when might makes right.@@@Russia’s aggression against Ukraine has come at an even higher cost.@@@I personally visited Ukraine in April.@@@My wife had the opportunity to visit the war-torn country only two weeks ago.@@@I saw the infamous crime scenes at Bucha and Borodyanka.@@@I found myself in the Dnipro region, only a few miles from the front line in an area ravaged by fighting.@@@The account of Russia’s atrocities, human rights violations and ferocious attacks against the innocent civilian population is overwhelming.@@@Children have been forcibly separated from their families, deported for re-education in order to make them forget their culture and who they are; entire towns and villages wiped out for no reason; mass graves and torture chambers in which people just disappear.@@@Sadly, the evidence tells the story better than any statement.@@@And the list of stories full of horror is endless, yet we cannot just passively observe it.@@@This must end.@@@Russia must unconditionally withdraw all troops from the entire territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders.@@@Russia’s leaders must be held accountable for the crime of aggression against its neighbour.@@@That is why we have extended our support for the establishment of a special tribunal to prosecute the crime of aggression against Ukraine.@@@It is our duty to ensure that those responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity are held accountable.@@@Apart from the violence, injustice and suffering of civilians, every war also brings destruction.@@@The reconstruction of Ukraine may be the largest rebuilding effort in modern history.@@@We support establishing a register of damage caused by Russian military and we call on all States to join those efforts.@@@Czechia will support Ukraine in its just defence as long as necessary.@@@From day one, we have stood by Ukraine’s side and provided the defenders with weapons and ammunition.@@@With the outbreak of Russian aggression against Ukraine.@@@Czechia has also stepped up its support for Russian and Belorussian pro- democratic voices, and Prague has become an important hub for journalists and human rights defenders in need.@@@For over 18 months.@@@Czechia has been providing humanitarian assistance to the war-affected Ukrainian population.@@@Per capita, my country has received more Ukrainian refugees — mostly women and children — than anybody else.@@@What the Ukrainian people truly deserve is peace — not just an end of hostilities but a just and durable peace.@@@If it is to be sustainable, that peace cannot be based on an unjust compromise or conditions imposed by the conqueror, nor should it leave hopes for Russia to fulfil its imperial ambitions.@@@It must be peace on the terms of the defender, not the aggressor, as President Zelenskyy of Ukraine stated earlier today.@@@Let us not forget that the damaging impacts of Russia’s aggression are being felt across the world.@@@Russia’s blockade of Ukrainian ports and destruction of infrastructure and grain continue to weaponize global food security in the most reckless and cynical way.@@@Let me be very clear.@@@Ukraine’s security is our own security — from Africa, to Europe, to Latin America, to Asia.@@@I call on the leaders of the free world to maintain their unity and support for Ukraine.@@@The threats we face are global and interconnected.@@@Because of Russia and a handful of other countries, our world is more dangerous and rougher.@@@Instead of cultivating cooperative security, we have to build up our militaries.@@@Instead of boosting social cohesion programmes and overcoming economic insecurity, we have to boost our defence budgets.@@@Those who contest the international rules are steering the wheel of global security back towards confrontation, and sooner or later at the expense of all of us.@@@Russia’s reckless threats to use nuclear weapons, its policy of coercion and intimidation represent a threat to the balance and integrity of the whole system of non-proliferation.@@@The announced stationing of nuclear weapons in Belarus is a further irresponsible escalation that Czechia condemns in the strongest terms.@@@Unfortunately.@@@Russia’s fingerprints can be found in several other current crises.@@@The security, humanitarian and political crises unfolding in the Sahel region are more than worrisome.@@@The international community must try to find a way to end the series of military coups and ensure a return to constitutional order.@@@That is the only way countries can effectively protect themselves against terrorism.@@@It is the only way the much-needed economic and social development called for by the Africans can take place.@@@The region remains vulnerable to numerous political, economic and climate risks.@@@Its long-term stability, security and prosperity are crucial.@@@We must offer genuine pragmatic partnerships.@@@Some countries pretend to be willing to help.@@@In reality, they create economic and political dependencies.@@@Those undermine long-term stability and manipulate the free will of people by spreading lies and disinformation.@@@In Asia and Pacific.@@@Czechia is an active and reliable ally and partner.@@@The word “cooperation” must remain key to our joint efforts in the region.@@@We deplore China’s military actions, which are raising tensions in the Taiwan Strait, and its unfriendly actions against partners in the South China Sea.@@@Any dispute or contagious issue must be resolved peacefully.@@@Any potential armed conflict in the region would have negative consequences for the whole world.@@@In North Korea and Iran, reckless escalation of nuclear or intercontinental ballistic missile activities, combined with a lack of transparency, threaten international and regional security.@@@The same applies to any material support to Russia’s military aggression in Ukraine.@@@It is clear that such supplies only aggravate the suffering of the Ukrainian civilian population.@@@The Middle East remains among the world’s most volatile regions, troubled by the spread of conflicts, terrorism and sectarian violence.@@@Efforts to normalize relations between Israel and its Arab neighbours are positive steps towards stability and peace in the region.@@@Our efforts to maintain peace and security are closely linked with our ability to promote human wellbeing and the sustainable development of our societies.@@@One may ask how a country of more than 10 million people can contribute to global ambitions.@@@Given our own national experience with oppression, fundamental rights and freedoms are deeply embedded in our values system and foreign policy.@@@Czechia strives to pursue an active human rights and democracy policy.@@@We are a staunch supporter of international human rights mechanisms.@@@Currently, we are proud to serve as the presidency of the Human Rights Council.@@@More than ever, we have to support media freedom to enable access to independent and factual information.@@@Without it, disinformation and propaganda can win.@@@The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Summit yesterday sent a strong message of urgency and determination.@@@The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is a promise to current and future generations, which we have to keep.@@@There is an urgent need to highlight the link between peace, security, climate and development, on the one hand, and human rights, justice and strong institutions on the other.@@@In the latest SDG index.@@@Czechia is ranked as the eighth most advanced country in the implementation of Agenda 2030 and its SDGs, yet we, too, face many challenges and we need to step up our efforts.@@@Climate change remains the single most destructive threat to the current and future existence and wellbeing of all humankind.@@@It threatens our lives, livelihoods, food security, prosperity and, ultimately, peace and security worldwide.@@@Czechs devote a great deal of attention to this issue.@@@It is no coincidence that it was under the Czech presidency of the Council of the European Union last year that we finalized crucial legislation that is showing the path towards the green transition of our industry.@@@Thirty years after the end of the Cold War, we are witnessing the efforts of authoritarian regimes to redefine core principles of the multilateral order.@@@Malign actors use cyberspace, disinformation, economic, political and other tools to disrupt democratic processes, to undermine our institutions and to weaken our security.@@@The challenges we face today are significant and it is apparent that only collective action can ensure a safe and prosperous future for all.@@@In that respect.@@@Czechia recognizes its global responsibility and remains committed to ensuring that no one is left behind.@@@I personally commit to working with the international community to complete the urgent tasks that must be done.@@@I would like to begin this statement by congratulating the Ambassador of Trinidad and Tobago.@@@Mr. Dennis Francis, on his election as President of the General Assembly, as well as Mr. Csaba Korosi, who, in a troubled international context, rigorously and efficiently maintained the activity of the Assembly during the seventy-seventh session.@@@We thank President Francis for the theme he has chosen.@@@“Rebuilding trust and revitalizing solidarity: Accelerating action on the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals towards peace, prosperity, progress and sustainability for all”.@@@We have made it our own, because it fully responds to the principles with which Andorra works, both from the point of view of domestic politics and from the perspective of international politics.@@@He can count on the loyal support of our country for the seventy-eighth session, and we wish him many successes.@@@A few weeks before the general debate began.@@@Secretary-General Antonio Guterres launched a new appeal to countries to act radically and urgently, because, as he warned us.@@@“[t]he era of global warming has ended; the era of global boiling has arrived...@@@Climate change is here.@@@It is terrifying.@@@And it is just the beginning”.@@@We must no longer look for subterfuges or deny the obvious — greenhouse-gas emissions caused by the unlimited consumption of natural resources have led our planet to exhaustion, which has never been more obvious than it was this summer.@@@The extreme temperatures that caused more than 61.000 deaths in Europe in 2022, the wave of fires on the North American continent and the Mediterranean coast, and El Nino have become recurrent phenomena that desiccate the world, make the land less cultivable and push people to abandon their place of origin because environmental degradation has made them climate refugees and condemned them to live far from home.@@@We humans are the culprits of climate change, which is why the solutions to stop it will come not from nature itself, which we are degrading, but from our ability to change the model of production and organization of our societies.@@@It may be too late to avoid certain consequences, which are already unfortunately irreversible, but not to slow down others and prevent the global temperature from increasing by more than 1.5°C by the end of the century.@@@To that end, major transformations and social and economic mutations are needed, because fighting and understanding climate change is not a purely scientific or technocratic question to be left in the hands of experts; it is, rather, a political, social, economic, ethical and even philosophical problem that lays bare the enormous inequalities of our world.@@@Thus, our conviction that the solutions lie in a new form of 
multilateralism more oriented towards collective action is stronger than ever.@@@Those solutions must strengthen and contribute to rebuilding international cooperation in order to provide adequate resources in the regions and promote inclusive governance and coordinated and supportive policies.@@@It is here at the United Nations that we must identify crises and adopt clear positions, actions and commitments in favour of the common good.@@@We must more than ever recall the original values of the Organization, which was born on the ruins of the most devastating war in history — an Organization serving peace, dialogue and multilateralism and intended to prevent the scourge of war.@@@Yet war is here.@@@Europe remains worried about a conflict that has become a war of attrition, with enormous consequences for the Ukrainian civilian population.@@@From our country, we strongly condemn that violation of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine.@@@We have also supported the declarations of the General Assembly, the positions expressed by other bodies such as the Council of Europe, and international sanctions, in particular those of the European Union.
Yemen.@@@Pakistan.@@@Ethiopia, the Sahel and other territories no longer make the headlines, yet they are frozen conflict zones whose most fragile populations are the main victims.@@@Andorra contributes to supporting the most vulnerable, particularly women and children, through the programmes of UNICEF and the International Committee of the Red Cross and their courageous work on the ground.@@@During all these years, the African continent has never ceased to be a source of concern, with breakdowns of democracy in many western States, often under terrorist threat.@@@Last July, we commemorated the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Rome Statute, the founding document of the International Criminal Court.@@@That milestone serves as a powerful reminder of the pressing need to promote justice for all victims of war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and human rights violations.@@@It was in that conviction that Andorra, alongside other small European States and civil society, grouped around non-governmental organizations, played a key role in the establishment of the International Criminal Court and wants to continue to be so in order to further strengthen the Organization.@@@This year, representing my country in the Assembly has a more special meaning for me than ever.@@@On 28 July.@@@Andorra celebrated the thirtieth anniversary of its accession as the 184th State Member of the United Nations.@@@The adoption of the Andorran Constitution in 1993 allowed us to enjoy international recognition, to make our voice heard outside our borders and to align ourselves with international law.@@@Allow me, as part of the commemoration of that landmark occasion, which is so important to all the citizens of Andorra, to recall the words that the Head of Government.@@@Mr. Oscar Ribas Reig, spoke from this rostrum three decades ago on how a small country like Andorra can contribute to improving this world.@@@He said:
“We are a small country, but one that is aware of the value of authenticity and of the fact that, in a world that is in certain ways inordinately large, small dimensions may offer a positive contribution to balanced coexistence.@@@What should be the ideal size of a State?@@@Neither economics nor political science can give us a definitive answer to this question, of course.@@@Aristotle, in his Politics, says that the size of the polis should permit all the inhabitants to be familiar with each other’s characters; it should be possible, he adds, completely to survey the territory from a mountaintop.@@@Andorra possesses these human and geographical features.”@@@(A/47/PV.108, p. 18).@@@It is from that human perspective of the value of authenticity, of freedom and of what is worth loving and preserving, and which has given us the benefit of more than 750 years of peace, that we can bring our knowledge and our commitments to bear on common challenges, and all within the framework of multilateralism.@@@In schools and areas reserved for children in the Principality of Andorra, there are posters highlighting the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@The posters are placed where adults can see them as well.@@@This is a metaphor for our society — a call from children to adults; a reminder that time is passing and that the future is in our hands; and one final message that our sense of responsibility and credibility should make it possible to accelerate the process, go further and reformulate current structures and move towards new financial, technological and environmental governance, with growth based on sustainability, cooperation and equality, in order to lay the future foundations for our children and young people.@@@The 2030 Agenda is a universal road map that guides the future of the planet towards sustainable, resilient and inclusive societies of peace.@@@Andorra’s commitment to achieving the Goals 
is firm, as demonstrated by its submission of two voluntary national reports monitoring the application of the SDGs.@@@It is for that reason that Andorra has adopted its national strategic plan on the implementation of Agenda 2030, which reflects the involvement of the Government, institutions and Andorran society as a whole in working for the sustainable development of our planet, building fairer societies and leaving no one behind.@@@From that point of view, we recognize and applaud the tireless work of Secretary-General Guterres and the presidency of the General Assembly in joining their efforts, because we still have an open window to ensure a viable and sustainable future sustainable for all, and specifically their recent organization of the Sustainable Development Goals Summit, in which Andorra actively participated.@@@Education is undoubtedly one of the best tools to achieve those objectives.@@@It is the basis of progress, the articulating axis of societies and the fundamental element of personal and collective growth as a guarantee of equality opportunities, respect, civic- mindedness, democracy and the future.@@@Andorra played an active part in last year’s Transforming Education Summit, in the conviction that we can contribute by sharing our experience in implementing SDG 4 to ensure quality, inclusive, equitable and multilingual education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all children and young people.@@@Andorra attaches particular importance to education, which allows us to offer elementary training of excellence so that children and young people of 65 different nationalities can grow in a context of learning the fundamental values of democracy and human rights, with a high degree of social cohesion and diversity and a strong sense of belonging.@@@Along with education, access to health is another fundamental pillar of any society.@@@The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has been a test of resistance and stress for the health system that Andorra has been able to overcome, because we have a solid system and thanks to its professional staff, who have honoured their profession by making a considerable effort to keep the population safe.@@@We must highlight the role of the World Health Organization, which this year celebrates its seventy-fifth anniversary — seventy- five years dedicated to the fight against diseases that permanently threaten certain countries, and against epidemics and pandemics, because they do not all bear the name COVID-19, and to confront the structural inequalities of access to health services, physical or mental, experienced by the population.@@@Gender equality is a subject of historical social injustice.@@@We obviously cannot change the past, but we can act to move towards a more egalitarian society, because if we want to achieve the transformation necessary for the sustainability of the planet, we cannot leave half of humankind behind.@@@In that respect, in recent years our country has made gender equality and non-discrimination essential values and has articulated pioneering and ambitious laws for its defence that are also taught in the schools.@@@The education of girls and the training of women constitute a domestic priority and are part of our international cooperation.@@@Andorra is a high mountain country and particularly sensitive to climate change, which seriously threatens our biodiversity, our water cycle and even, ultimately, our way of life.@@@Given the geographical specificities of our territory, landlocked in the Pyrenees, we are very active members of the Mountain Partnership, and we campaigned for the Aspen Declaration to include specific mention of the Pyrenees, as had already been done for other mountainous regions.@@@We have advocated for the particular vulnerability of mountain regions around the world to receive specific attention in international forums devoted to climate change.@@@That fight that cannot be won without clearly focusing on the energy transition, one of the global challenges that our country must also face and that clearly responds to our international and national commitment to our citizens to moving us towards carbon neutrality.@@@Andorra’s accession as a member of the Carbon Neutrality Coalition allows us to learn and share experiences with other member States.@@@We were pioneers in the implementation of a green tax by establishing a carbon price of €30 per ton, allowing us to move towards a more sustainable modality.@@@We adopted a law of circular economy that sets 2035 as the deadline for achieving a production model in which most waste will be transformed into by-products to be reintroduced into the production chain, with special emphasis on the fight against the waste of resources, and specifically food.@@@We have also implemented general free public transport not only to help families with fewer resources, but also to limit journeys in private vehicles.@@@We are a State that seeks to adapt to the European Union because if we wish to move forward, we cannot 
circumvent the certainty that the geographic and demographic interdependence of our country with Europe is total.@@@The Europeanization of the values of our society; of our legislation, which is strongly inspired by community law; and of the professional aspirations of our young people, who every day face a more demanding job market, is more than sufficient reason for us not to not turn our back on Europe.@@@Likewise, it is essential to continue working to defend the values of multilateralism, such as human rights, democracy and the rule of law.@@@They have helped us promote peace and security on the European continent and in the rest of the world.@@@We have put the planet under considerable pressure.@@@As I said earlier, the window is still open, but one thing is certain — it can close suddenly.@@@We must take advantage of the era of scientific knowledge and, in that regard.@@@I would like to highlight the importance of science, which has helped us so much to improve our living conditions.@@@Today we know much more about the behaviour of the Earth’s atmosphere, its interaction with the land and oceans, and its effects on water resources and the survival of species.@@@The scenario to follow cannot be a monologue, but must be a dialogue among all peoples and for all peoples.@@@It is for that reason that in our country, we are prepared to seek, more than ever before, the points of convergence necessary to rebuild trust and revitalize solidarity, accelerate action on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals, as I have already announced, and work to prepare in the best way for the Summit of the Future, which will take place in 2024, for peace, prosperity, progress and sustainability for all.@@@After almost eight decades of existence, the United Nations has allowed us to learn many lessons in many areas, from maintaining peace to the fight against climate change.@@@All those lessons have one thing in common — the great challenges facing humankind require the participation of all countries and all people, because the international community progresses only by understanding its interdependencies and the fact that no country is big enough to face the challenges alone, and that solutions, to be fair and lasting, must include everyone.@@@It is about laying solid foundations for a future where no one is left behind and where the demand for co-responsibility is fully shared.@@@This is how we Andorrans believe that we must concentrate our efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, the fight against climate change and the provision of quality education to all inhabitants of the planet, with the assistance of the institutions of governance — in sum, all the aspirations of the international community that have resounded throughout the General Assembly.@@@Members know that they can count on Andorra’s commitment to pursuing progress together.@@@I would like to acknowledge the work of the President of the seventy-seventh session and to congratulate the President of this session.@@@Mr. Dennis Francis, by welcoming the theme adopted for the session on the need to rebuild trust among nations and to address threats to peace, prosperity and the progress of the peoples of the United Nations.@@@Today we find ourselves at an unprecedented time.@@@For more than a year and a half, we have watched with horror the war launched against Ukraine by the Russian Federation, which violates the most elementary principles on which the international order was based after the Second World War.@@@Delegations know what the worst thing is — that we seem to have got used to it.@@@We have become accustomed to flagrant violations of human rights in Ukraine, to war and to death.@@@Worse still, instead of dealing with it, we have become 
accustomed to looking the other way in the face of a sad and stark reality that we try to ignore.@@@That has led us to mistrust among human beings, inequality among nations and a lack of respect for peace agreements.@@@In those circumstances, human prosperity and progress are impossible.@@@Today, here, before all.@@@I declare that this Organization is not the most active: we have food insecurity, deaths due to wars and large-scale migration, among many other problems.@@@We must therefore make it work.@@@We must all work together.@@@We need a revitalized Organization that seeks solutions but, above all, we need countries that are willing to overcome their ideological positions and their long-standing conflicts.@@@This is the time for human beings, represented by their peoples, to shake hands and to be ready to share their wealth by investing in countries that need it in order to generate the wealth to survive.@@@It is about saving the human race.@@@It is about saving the planet.@@@It is about having future generations living in peace and development.@@@As an example of what I am talking about, we can mention the vast movements of human beings fleeing the crises in their countries due to insecurity, a lack of food or the economic conditions.@@@Under that new order, we must therefore achieve a United Nations striving for peace and human development.@@@We must demand respect for international law, respect for the peaceful settlement of disputes and respect for the self-determination of peoples.@@@To achieve that, every country must raise its voice.@@@Every country must say “enough is enough”.@@@Today my country joins the cry to say “enough is enough”.@@@My country joins the global call for the immediate withdrawal of Russian forces, while respecting the territorial integrity and national unity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders.@@@Glory to Ukraine.@@@Disarmament and the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, as well as the use of nuclear energy for peaceful uses, are among the most important pillars of the Organization.@@@As a State party to the Treaty of Tlatelolco, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, my country is deeply committed to the common goal of a world free of weapons of mass destruction.@@@Imagine what a catastrophe it would be for the world if the Russian Federation’s illegal and unprovoked aggression were to destroy the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe, the physical integrity and operation of which are threatened, and which could cause a disaster of unimaginable magnitude.@@@That is why I reiterate Guatemala’s position as a country that respects the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.@@@I urge that all nuclear-weapon States, including the five permanent members of the Security Council, charged with maintaining peace and security within this Organization, sit down and candidly achieve total global nuclear disarmament.@@@Guatemala contributes to the maintenance of international security through its active participation in peacekeeping operations.@@@As a country that promotes peace.@@@Guatemala has committed to the United Nations by deploying Guatemalan officers, making us the fourth-largest troop contributor in the Americas.@@@We reiterate our firm commitment to, and solidarity with, the development and prosperity of the Haitian people, who are at risk owing to a multidimensional crisis of a political nature, internal security and a lack of development and the humanitarian crisis that they are experiencing.@@@As an international community, we must respond and deal with catastrophes before they become even more devastating.@@@If this Organization decides on a new peace mission to be deployed on Haitian territory, it can count on Guatemala’s participation in the instruction and training of Haitian forces for as long as the peace mission is present in that country.@@@In the proposed change to the foundations of the United Nations so that it has the mechanisms to enable it to meet the main challenges facing humankind, so in need of peace and development.@@@Guatemala calls on the community of States to make rapid progress on a proposal, under the aegis of country-level experts, to define substantive reforms to the United Nations so that it can return to the commendable path following its founding in 1945, with which, over the years, we have forgotten to fully comply.@@@I propose that we initiate as soon as possible a fourth amendment to the founding Charter, that addresses such new approaches and is in line with the current times, which are indeed difficult times, but they also bring with them great opportunities.@@@In that amendment, it must be ensured that recognition of the sovereign equality of States is a reality, that the peaceful resolution of conflicts between countries is an obligation and that nuclear energy is used only 
for peaceful purposes, but, perhaps most important of all, that the Members of the United Nations do not exclude anyone.@@@As our book Popol Vuh, from one of the world’s greatest civilizations, the Mayan civilization, says: “Let no one be left behind; let everyone rise up”.@@@Today I wish to say that, as the ruler of a founding country of the United Nations.@@@I recognize that the transformation of this body will lead to a radical change in multilateralism.@@@It must acknowledge the importance of the inclusiveness and universality of this Organization.@@@How can it be, in the twenty-first century, that this Organization excludes a country like Taiwan?@@@It is a country that contributes to science, sophisticated technology, health and development, among many other things.@@@However, what is most important is that we have prevented the citizens of Taiwan from having a voice to represent them in this forum.@@@Guatemala calls on the United Nations to exhaust all necessary means to ensure international peace and security in the Taiwan Strait.@@@We also condemn the constant and increasing military manoeuvres in the waters and airspace around Taiwan, which endanger the security of the region, and which affect international transportation and trade.@@@Four years ago.@@@I took office as President of the Republic of Guatemala.@@@In that time.@@@I have heard great speeches, and major treaties and commitments have been signed to stop climate change.@@@I want to tell everyone that the world today is worse than it was four years ago.@@@The world needs action more than speeches, commitments and treaties.@@@The region that suffers the most from the impacts of climate change is the Caribbean and Central American region.@@@Although we generate only a small percentage of greenhouse gases, we suffer the most damage year after year.@@@We are exhausting our resources and must in-debt ourselves in order to rebuild countries that are damaged again the following year, which leads us to seek out loans from international sources that grant them very happily and then live off of international usury.@@@The reports of United Nations rapporteurs then speak of the lack of human development in our countries.@@@They criticize and point fingers at us.@@@But who points the finger at those who, due to industrialization and lack of commitment to combating the impacts of climate change and greenhouse gases, cause the death of human beings around the world?@@@There are countries that neither accept the United Nations agreements on climate change nor pay their budgetary contributions, and yet refuse to accept responsibility for the high level of pollution caused by their industries, much less for the destruction they cause.@@@Is that fair?@@@The serious threat of drug use, especially synthetic drugs, should be a topic of great concern for the international community.@@@It is an invisible enemy that has an impact on health in addition to affecting governance and slowing the development of countries.@@@Among the changes in the approach to this issue that the Organization must make, countries must understand that transnational crime must be combated transnationally, because, as it turns out, the large consumer countries are also the main countries that launder money, a product of the drug business, making this fight a global responsibility.@@@We have to end it.@@@The fight against drug trafficking, including synthetic drugs, must be a joint and coordinated effort in which information flows in accordance with domestic and international regulations.@@@We must implement effective strategies to confront criminal organizations that cause hundreds of thousands of deaths per year.@@@A world free of drugs will not be achieved without a world committed to fighting them.@@@Guatemala is firmly committed to the promotion of food security and the zero-hunger goal in the framework of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@To that end, we have increased our national food budget and strengthened the school nutrition law, which aims to guarantee the nutrition of school-age children and adolescents in a sustainable way, with a view to guaranteeing their ability to enjoy a decent, healthy and active life.@@@I am proud to report that, in 2022.@@@2.6 million students in public educational centres benefitted from those efforts.@@@Guatemala also notes with alarm that the Black Sea Grain Initiative was not renewed.@@@We highlight the risks that poses to food security worldwide, including difficulties for humanitarian operations that help to alleviate hunger worldwide and the destabilization of food prices.@@@We condemn the use of hunger as a tool of war.@@@That is a violation of human rights and international humanitarian law.@@@We call for good sense and cooperation, and for preventing the further deterioration of the global food situation.@@@A topic that does not seem important but should be significant for a revitalized Organization is cultural heritage, because our world’s mosaic of cultural diversity is threatened by war.@@@We must reinforce and safeguard the evidence of our past, which is essential to understanding our present and building our future.@@@Guatemala has worked very hard to care for our heritage and to showcase to the world our ancient cultural wealth, and it is with satisfaction and pride that we can say that the celebration of Holy Week was declared a part of the intangible cultural heritage of humanity.@@@I also wish to mention that yesterday the Tak’alik Ab’aj National Park, which is considered to be the first city where the Mayan civilization originated, was declared a World Heritage site.@@@As the old saying goes, he who does not know his past cannot make the best of his present and future.@@@Guatemala is known for its consistent calls for respect for international law and respect for sovereignty.@@@We have done the work and proved that differences can be resolved through international justice mechanisms.@@@Such is the case with our territorial, insular and maritime dispute with Belize, which both countries are committed to resolving in a peaceful and respectful manner, whatever the International Court of Justice decides on the matter.@@@The good will between the parties, as demonstrated by Belize and Guatemala, is an example of how a peaceful solution can be reached through international justice, in contrast to war over conflicts resulting from the foolishness of human beings.@@@Guatemala recognizes that one of the greatest and alarming threats to life and freedom of our time is human trafficking, a contemptible phenomenon that not only violates human rights, but is a veritable crime against humanity that violates the most basic values that we cling to, as a community of nations.@@@This crime is related to slavery, as its practice involves the purchase and sale of human beings, who should live in freedom as a fundamental right of life.@@@That is why my country unequivocally condemns this crime.@@@In that spirt, we have adopted a series of legal and political measures to repress it.@@@We have a public policy against violence, exploitation and trafficking in persons, which aligns with and optimizes State actions to guarantee the protection of and the comprehensive care for victims of human trafficking.@@@It also promotes the prevention, detection, prosecution and punishment of this abhorrent crime.@@@In the same vein, we have a policy for the comprehensive protection of children and adolescents, which focuses on guaranteeing the comprehensive, equitable and inclusive development of children and adolescents.@@@This policy, which was adopted in 2022, brings together more than 90 executive branch institution programmes for the development of human beings at all stages of life.@@@Guatemala, through these different initiatives, seeks to stand out in the fight against human trafficking, given that the number of people affected by this phenomenon exceeds the number of enslaved persons in times past.@@@That is why we have made it a priority to stop these scourges, which are an affront to human dignity and human beings.@@@I must remind States that the profits generated by human trafficking already exceed those from international arms trafficking and, at this rate, will soon reach and surpass those from illicit drug trafficking.@@@Children are ripped from their homes and given to gangs that prostitute them, and, when they cease to be fresh meat for these criminals, they are dismissed and their organs sold for transplants.@@@We cannot continue to be indifferent and apathetic in the face of these horrifying crimes.@@@This is my last speech before the General Assembly as Head of State, and, unlike the untruths that we have heard from the rostrum today.@@@I will hand power over to the person elected by the sovereign majority will of the people of Guatemala, on 14 January, in accordance with the Constitution.@@@Unnecessary international interference has marred the elections.@@@While our democracy may not be perfect, it has made the handover of power possible in addition to respect for the Constitution on a continent where some presidents fight to stay and hold on to their positions, allowing re-elections even against what is mandated by their own constitutions.@@@In Guatemala, the principle of handing over power is fully complied with, every four years.@@@In conclusion, the United Nations is facing history’s greatest challenge, one that requires us to be strong, united and ready for action.@@@World peace, which we took for granted for years, now requires a new international agreement that goes beyond differences, colour, countries and latitudes.@@@We need a people-centred agreement that has citizens as protagonists and people as the ultimate objective.@@@Putting an end to war, which would be ideal, is today’s great imperative.@@@Whatever our beliefs, let us fight for peace.@@@Wherever we are, let us fight for peace lest one day we wake up to find ourselves invaded or killed by others.@@@For that reason, let us unite, let us strive so that one day we can all awake citizens of the world in a climate of peace, progress, prosperity and development.@@@First of all.@@@I wish to congratulate Ambassador Dennis Francis on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session and to extend our best wishes for success in his tenure of office.@@@We also thank his predecessor.@@@Ambassador Csaba Korosi, for his steadfast leadership over the preceding session.@@@Trust and solidarity form the bedrock of a functional multilateral order.@@@Seventy-eight years ago, the United Nations was founded with the aim of preventing future global conflicts, promoting international cooperation and maintaining peace and security among nations.@@@The lessons of history are clear: an unwavering commitment to meaningful cooperation and dedication to global peace and security are essential to enhance human existence and prevent the recurrence of past tragedies.@@@As the challenge to global peace, security and prosperity takes on new dimensions, the lessons of the past become even more relevant.@@@The world stands at the brink, facing conflicts, wars and human-induced disasters, while countless people continue to struggle for a decent existence.@@@Disunity and distrust threaten to paint a bleak future, devoid of hope and possibilities.@@@Overcoming that predicament demands that we find common ground amid division.@@@As we gather here today at the seventy-eighth session of the General Assembly, we are confronted with the urgent need to rebuild trust and reignite global solidarity in order to accelerate action on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).@@@Only through collective action can we achieve the vision of a better world for all.@@@At the heart of our discussion lies the 2030 Agenda, a transformative blueprint for sustainable development.@@@It serves as a road map for eradicating poverty, promoting human rights, protecting our planet and ensuring that no one is left behind.@@@However, as we review our progress, it is evident that we are falling short of our targets, and the global pandemic has further exacerbated the challenges before us.@@@Now more than ever, we must renew our commitment to the SDGs and take decisive action to fulfil our promises.@@@We are lagging behind.@@@At the midway point for the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable 
Development, it is crucial that we accelerate our joint efforts to make transformative advancements on achieving the SDGs.@@@The Sustainable Development Goals Report 2023 paints a sombre picture of lost progress or regression on more than 30 per cent of the targets, with vulnerable countries facing inequality, poverty, hunger and environmental degradation.@@@Addressing those imbalances and advancing the SDGs can be achieved only through collective action.@@@To accelerate action on the SDGs, we must prioritize implementation at all levels.@@@That necessitates the alignment of national policies, plans and strategies with the objectives of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@It requires robust institutions, capable of driving progress and delivering results.@@@It demands innovative financing mechanisms, as well as increased investment in sustainable infrastructure, technology transfer and capacity-building.@@@We must foster an enabling environment for entrepreneurship, innovation and inclusive economic growth, while also addressing the root causes of inequality, poverty and environmental degradation.@@@Furthermore, we must harness the power of partnerships.@@@The achievement of the SDGs requires collaboration among Governments, civil society, the private sector and international organizations.@@@By forging strategic alliances, we can leverage resources, expertise and influence to catalyse change.@@@South-@@@South cooperation, in particular, holds great potential for knowledge exchange and mutually beneficial development.@@@We must also reaffirm our commitment to multilateralism, as the United Nations serves as the cornerstone of our collective efforts towards peace, prosperity, progress and sustainability.@@@Seychelles, through processes like the African Peer Review Mechanism and the voluntary national review, seeks to consolidate gains from prevailing political and socioeconomic successes.@@@We stand ready to share our experiences and strengthen cooperation with other countries.@@@However, rebuilding confidence in the SDGs requires transforming words into concrete actions.@@@First, development partners must deliver on the Addis Ababa Action Agenda by scaling up financing and the means of implementing the SDGs.@@@Secondly, international institutions should embrace reform to ensure that the unique needs of vulnerable countries are considered in access to development financing.@@@Seychelles firmly believes in the critical importance of adopting a multidimensional vulnerability index that fully responds to the needs of small island developing States (SIDS).@@@Thirdly, we need to leverage effective financing mechanisms, such as impact investments, public private partnerships and debt relief, to yield greater results for development agendas such as Agenda 2063 and the forthcoming outcome of the fourth International Conference on Small Island Developing States in 2024.@@@The Secretary-General’s SDG stimulus, aimed at transforming the global financial system, is commendable, and international financial institutions must collaborate to support our collective ambition for a sustainable future.@@@Redressing those imbalances and advancing the SDGs will be achieved only if we work together.@@@If we are to make progress on our development agenda, we can no longer call what we are facing climate change.@@@The point at which lives and livelihoods are lost with frightening frequency owing to environmental disasters means that we are living through a climate crisis.@@@Addressing the climate crisis is no longer optional.@@@It is an immediate necessity.@@@As the Secretary-General said, the era of global warming has transitioned into an era of global boiling, and leaders must lead to limit the rise in global temperatures to 1.5°C.@@@Seychelles is committed to renewable energy and energy efficiency, but as a small island developing State, it lacks the capacity and infrastructure to develop those solutions fully.@@@The countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the Group of 20, as major emitters, must take decisive action to lead in combating climate change.@@@The establishment of the loss and damage fund is a positive step, but its operationalization is crucial to compensate those most at risk.@@@Nature-based solutions, exemplified by Seychelles’ pioneering of blue bonds and the blue economy, showcase the potential for sustainable development.@@@Transparent ocean governance offers opportunities for development and environmental protection.@@@In that context.@@@I pay tribute to the bold actions of SIDS such as Bermuda and Tonga, which have purposefully moved to harnessing wave energy as feasible solutions to independent and clean energy futures.@@@Seychelles will continue the same ambitious approach as we assume the presidency of the SIDS dock from Tonga.@@@Furthermore, the SIDS Coalition for Nature, launched by Seychelles.@@@Belize.@@@Cabo Verde and Samoa, is mobilizing support for ambitious biodiversity targets.@@@That is clear evidence that SIDS continue to lead by example — doing more than their fair share to alleviate the pressure being exerted on our planet.@@@It is through such trust-building cooperation that we will obtain impactful outcomes, as demonstrated by the recent adoption of the High Seas Treaty.@@@To achieve the SDGs and ensure peace, prosperity, progress and sustainability for all, we must embrace the interconnectedness of our world.@@@Climate change knows no boundaries, poverty respects no borders and the quest for peace requires a collective effort.@@@Seychelles, as a nation uniquely positioned amid the vast Indian Ocean, knows first-hand the significance of global cooperation in addressing climate change, ocean conservation, sustainable development and maritime security.@@@Seychelles remains committed to its pioneering role in marine conservation, protecting vast areas of our ocean and marine ecosystems, but we cannot succeed alone.@@@We call upon the global community to prioritize sustainability, transition to clean energy and preserve our ecosystems for the prosperity of all.@@@Last but not least, as we rebuild from the pandemic, we must do so with an unwavering commitment to inclusivity.@@@No one should be left behind.@@@We must invest in health-care systems, education and social safety nets that guarantee the well-being of every citizen.@@@We must promote gender equality, empower youth and create opportunities for marginalized communities.@@@Inclusivity is not just a goal; it is the cornerstone of a just and equitable world.@@@In conclusion, rebuilding trust is paramount.@@@Trust is the foundation on which nations cooperate, and it is through trust that we foster meaningful partnerships and collaborations.@@@We must rekindle trust among nations, between Governments and citizens, and across various sectors of society.@@@That requires transparent and accountable governance, bolstered by an unwavering dedication to the principles of democracy, human rights and the rule of law.@@@By doing so, we can restore the faith of our people and mobilize their active participation in the pursuit of sustainable development.@@@Our success hinges on global solidarity.@@@The challenges we face are interconnected and transcend national boundaries.@@@No nation can solve them in isolation.@@@Therefore, we must strengthen our bonds of solidarity, cooperation and mutual support.@@@That includes sharing experiences, knowledge and best practices, as well as providing assistance to those most in need.@@@The principle of leaving no one behind should guide our actions, ensuring that the most vulnerable among us receive the support they require.@@@Let us rise above our differences and work together for a better world.@@@Rebuilding trust and reigniting global solidarity is not just an option; it is the only way forward.@@@Together, we can accelerate action on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals, creating a world that embraces diversity, respects nature and ensures a future of peace, prosperity, progress and sustainability for all.@@@It is an honour and a privilege to return to this rostrum this year.@@@This is my tenth appearance here.@@@I am proud to be back to this most important forum, but doubly so because a son of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and the wider Caribbean region sits as its President.@@@I therefore wish Ambassador Dennis Francis well, and suffice it to say that the Bahamas stands ready to assist and support him.@@@The Bahamas National Statistics Institute reported this year in the national census that there are now 399.314 people living in the Bahamas — let us call that 400.000.@@@We are a small country of 700 islands, cays and reefs — that is clear.@@@We have 4.000 square miles of land in 100.000 square miles of ocean — that is clear.@@@We are therefore a small island developing State — and that is very clear.@@@Our Prime Minister Philip Edward “Brave” Davis says that the number one foreign policy issue for the Bahamas is climate change.@@@He has expressed the existential fear we face along with other island peoples, in the Atlantic and the Pacific alike, as to whether we will become climate refugees or face a watery grave.@@@Tonight I am wearing a gift from the people of the Marshall Islands to share our solidarity with those in the Pacific.@@@Given that our Prime Minister has expressed those sentiments in many forums around the world throughout his years in office, it was indeed shocking to hear the national position of one of our developed- nation partners on reparations for loss and damage from climate change.@@@He stated that there would be no such reparations under any circumstances.@@@Small island developing States such as the Bahamas have been negotiating for loss and damage for more than 30 years.@@@That therefore raises the question: how much are 399.314 lives worth?@@@The word “reparations” means so much in another context as well.@@@Millions of African peoples were ripped from the continent of Africa, brought to the West and worked for free for 200 years.@@@In the British Empire, they were so-called “freed” in 1834 and worked for another four years under an apprenticeship scheme for free.@@@The British Government paid £20 million — then 40 per cent of the national budget — to the slavers for the loss of their property.@@@That is £17 billion in today’s money, and we are advised that the bonds were just paid off in 2015.@@@Yet not one penny was paid to the slaves or to their descendants.@@@And not even an apology has been offered for the moral tragedy that slavery represents.@@@That means a “no” to reparations on climate damage and a “no” to reparations on slavery — “no” over and over again.@@@However, the generation of our leaders that came before us did not accept no for an answer.@@@That is why we are freer today than we were a generation ago, just as they were freer than the generation before them.@@@When Prime Minister Michael Manley of Jamaica stood before this very rostrum after his historic victory at the polls in 1972 and demanded a new international economic order (see A/PV.2049), his call for economic and social justice did not at first succeed, but it has been taken up by his successors, who continue that call throughout the Caribbean.@@@Mr. Manley was taking up the call by Marcus Garvey of Jamaica before him and Joseph Robert Love of the Bahamas, who belonged to the generation preceding Mr. Manley.@@@Moreover.@@@Marcus Garvey was taking up the calls of W. E. B. DuBois and James Weldon Johnson, who had Bahamian roots, before him.@@@Lynden Pindling, our founding Prime Minister, did not accept “no” when the Nassau Accords were forged to say “let Nelson Mandela go”.@@@Clearly, then, “no” is not an acceptable answer to give an unfree people.@@@We in this generation take up the call — Brave Davis and the Bahamas say that “no” is not an acceptable answer.@@@Therefore, the Bahamas wants the world to know that, whether it be on reparations for slavery or on climate change, “no” is not the correct answer.@@@We must use our collective voices to reject the gospel according to “no”.@@@As long as we have our voices, we will pass our message on to the next generation, and so on, until we succeed and justice is served.@@@We do not accept the gospel according to “no” when it comes to Haiti.@@@As the first Black republic and the first independent Caribbean State.@@@Haiti has paid dearly for daring to declare and assert its independence from colonial rule back in 1804.@@@First, they were forced to pay some $20 billion in today’s money to be let alone by their former colonial masters.@@@Then, in the twentieth century, they were ruled for two decades by an invading military that took all the wealth from their treasury and forced the payment of sums back to Washington.@@@D C.@@@And today we wonder why the situation is as dire as it is.@@@The Western world owes Haiti and the Haitian people, and we must fight to help them resolve their issues.@@@The security situation in Haiti today is untenable.@@@I thank all the Governments in both the developed world — namely, the United States and Canada — and in CARICOM for their work in trying to resolve the political and security issues there.@@@I urge the people of Haiti, especially the leaders of Haiti today, to do all that they can to continue to work towards a Haitian-led political settlement, and it will require compromise to do so.@@@In response to this humanitarian crisis in our region, the United Nations has received many humanitarian pledges that can barely meet the humanitarian needs of the Haitian people on the ground.@@@We must approve without delay a Security Council-backed draft resolution on a multinational force for Haiti, first.@@@I would like to thank the Government of Kenya for pledging to lead a multinational force to improve the security issues in Haiti.@@@We in the Bahamas plan to join them, as does Jamaica, and other Caribbean countries have pledged humanitarian support.@@@They, along with all other States, have pledged support, but a Security Council resolution is required to take action.@@@As I said, both the Bahamas and Jamaica have pledged troops, and other CARICOM States have pledged humanitarian support.@@@A geopolitical settlement must also be possible in Cuba.@@@What a magnificent country, with a rich heritage and a smart people who have suffered from economic measures that seem imposed upon them, externally grounded in ideology.@@@However, if one can do business with Viet Nam, there is no logic that prevents doing business with Cuba.@@@The irony of the situation is that money in United States dollars is difficult to process across Cuban borders, yet nine or more flights per day leave Miami for Havana and fly back again, and the largest Embassy in Havana is that of the United States.@@@We appreciate all the steps that have been taken by the present United States Administration to revert to the status quo ante to 2016 as a starting point, but the most sensible thing to do is to drop all the restrictions and normalize relations with Cuba post-haste.@@@The continuation of the status quo represents a security problem for the Bahamas.
Finally.@@@I wish to repeat a favourite theme of our Prime Minister, and it is this: the pathologies resulting from the asymmetric relationship between our trading partners in the European Union and the Americas on the question of financial services.@@@The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the European Union have arrogated to themselves to be the moral police of the world on taxation issues.@@@The result is that free trade no longer exists, but a tax process is being imposed by our former colonial masters, making banking so difficult within our domestic spheres, and international trade is made even more difficult.@@@Moreover, they have gone one step farther by now imposing the requirement for what they call an electronic travel authority for one to enter their countries, even when they say there is no visa required for entry.@@@The Prime Minister therefore joins other developing States in supporting a United Nations convention on tax that will govern standards on taxation frameworks, including financial services.@@@The OECD cannot declare legitimacy for developing universal outputs while decision-making and membership remain exclusive.@@@Therefore, in our view, the United Nations is the appropriate and universal body to design and build an equitable and inclusive international tax administration architecture with representation on equal footing.@@@The Bahamas is 50 years old this year.@@@On 10 July 1973, we became independent, and this year.@@@50 years later, it was a very proud moment for our citizens.@@@At the Sandilands Primary School in my constituency in Nassau, if one says the words of a popular song, even the little children know the song, and I bet members of the delegation know it as well.@@@A man named Elkin Outten sang this song, and it says.@@@“Nassau is the capital”, and the children say.@@@“Bahamas”; “Bimini is the gateway”, and the children say.@@@“Bahamas”; “1492.@@@Columbus landed”, and the children will reply.@@@“Bahamas”.@@@“1973, we were free”.@@@— “Bahamas”.@@@Happy anniversary.@@@Bahamas — golden jubilee.@@@Bahamas.@@@We are proud of our country.@@@I leave the song with all present and invite them to come visit us.@@@Eight million people will join us as tourists this year — we are 400.000 strong.@@@Stay and enjoy our beauty; understand our climate vulnerability.@@@In our work, we ask all to join us to help reverse the tidal rising.@@@Now, more than ever, we need the United Nations.@@@I am honoured to speak before the General Assembly today, and I express my deep appreciation for the General Assembly.@@@The Assembly serves as a unique platform for global cooperation and offers hope for a better world.@@@I want to express my sincere congratulations to President Francis on his election and convey my best wishes for his continued success in leading the Assembly.@@@I would also like to extend my warmest regard to Secretary-General Guterres for his continuous efforts to achieve peace in the world and for standing firm in defence of the Charter of the United Nations, international law and human rights in the face of the great adversity of our times.@@@His leadership fosters trust in the United Nations.@@@Rebuilding trust and reigniting global solidarity are more necessary than ever for reconciliation, good understanding and more cooperation — they are the only way we can face today’s common and global challenges that not only affect the present but also risking the future of the next generations.@@@It should all begin by assessing regions and countries on the basis of their contribution rather than their failures.@@@Since 1955, when Albania became a State Member of the United Nations, a great deal has changed.@@@Once a self-isolated country.@@@Albania now proudly stands as a NATO member and has initiated accession negotiations with the European Union.@@@Currently.@@@Albania is concluding its first term as a non-permanent member of the Security Council, and this month, we are productively presiding over that United Nations body for the second time.@@@As part of the western Balkans.@@@Albania continues to make an unwavering contribution to peace and stability in the region.@@@Albanians play a crucial role in south-eastern Europe.@@@We constitute the large majority in two independent republics.@@@Albania and Kosova.@@@We form a constitutive minority in North Macedonia and Montenegro and a significant minority in the southern part of Serbia.@@@Throughout our history.@@@Albania has adhered to a policy of friendship and good-neighbourly relations.@@@We remain deeply concerned by the crises that recur from time to time in relations among its neighbours.@@@Both Albania and Kosova have consistently championed peace over tension and conflicts, and we remain committed to that path.@@@We hope to be recognized for our contribution and not to allow our endeavours to be overshadowed by opposing narratives.@@@In that context.@@@Albania supports the difficult yet not ongoing dialogue between Kosova and Serbia, facilitated through careful mediation by the European Union and strongly supported by the United States.@@@At the same time.@@@Albania remains sensitive to Kosova’s integrity and prosperity.@@@Kosova has managed to heal many deep wounds from the tragic past.@@@The rise of the Serbs in Kosova reflects European norms and values, and the same should be applied to the Albanian minority in the Presevo Valley in southern Serbia.@@@Unfortunately, we remain concerned about the passivization of their residential addresses and the absence of substantial investments and economic incentives in that region.@@@Kosova has demonstrated that pain need not breed hostility but can translate into understanding and support.@@@However.@@@Kosova still awaits recognition of its independence by many countries.@@@I hope that those countries will soon acknowledge Kosova’s contribution to a fairer and more peaceful global community and grant it the recognition it deserves.@@@Recognize Kosova’s independence.@@@Despite being a small nation with a young democracy.@@@Albania has a history marked by wars it did not choose and domination it neither sought nor accepted.@@@While those memories are painful, they have also imparted invaluable lessons.@@@It is precisely because of its history that Albania places great importance on international law as its foremost defence.@@@We firmly embrace the principles underpinning the rules-based international order, where relations among nations are founded on respect, rather than sheer power.@@@That commitment is why we have consistently and unequivocally condemned the military aggression against Ukraine, and we will continue to do so.@@@Despite our size.@@@Albania has been actively engaged on the international stage both regionally and globally in the pursuit of peace and security.@@@However, we recognize that sustainable development is an integral component of achieving international peace and security.@@@On the other hand, meaningful sustainable development is unattainable without a foundation of genuine peace and security.@@@Sadly, the unprovoked and unjustified Russian act of aggression against its neighbour speaks louder than our words.@@@This absurd and malicious war has directly and indirectly affected various dimensions of sustainable development, not only for Ukraine and the region but also for the entire globe.@@@This senseless war has disrupted trade, caused economic instability, destroyed infrastructure, including transport networks and industrial facilities, and diverted attention and resources away from addressing shared challenges, promoting development and implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@The war in Ukraine has strained regional stability and affected cooperation among countries.@@@It has highlighted geopolitical tensions and strained diplomatic relations, hindering international cooperation on sustainable development initiatives.@@@As we have witnessed, the spillover effects of the war, which include displacement, migration and economic and security concerns, can have global ramifications that impede progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).@@@Albania welcomed the SDG Summit called by the Secretary-General and the political declaration adopted therein.@@@It is a milestone in re-energizing our joint efforts and commitments to implementing the 2030 Agenda.@@@We firmly believe that the success of the SDGs lies in our collective efforts to address challenges that hinder sustainable development.@@@Collective efforts mean the urgent need for decisive action to better support developing countries.@@@Albania acknowledges the imperative to introduce reforms and stands ready to work alongside the international community in ensuring and enabling an environment that allows developing countries to actively participate in and benefit from the global economy.@@@I would like to emphasize that Albania is committed to reducing the levels of domestic poverty and inequality by 2027 and 2030, in line with our nationally determined climate contributions.@@@We recognize the need for comprehensive policy commitments to drive the necessary energy, food, digital and social transitions necessary to achieve those benchmarks.@@@Aligning our national budget with the SDGs, mainstreaming gender equality, revitalizing public sector capacities and strengthening our data and monitoring systems are among the fundamental actions we prioritize.@@@Albania recognizes the significance of this session as a pivotal moment for our world.@@@It is an opportunity to shift from fear to hope and from deepening pessimism to accelerated action.@@@We are committed to playing our part and collaborating with the international community to ensure the successful realization of the 2030 Agenda.@@@I would also like to bring the Assembly’s attention to Albania’s position on one of the most debated issues today, that of multilateralism.@@@Today’s critical challenges show that universal reason is the only way out.@@@We recognize that peace is indivisible.@@@We cannot secure peace on the backs of people who perish in war.@@@No one can truly have lasting peace until everyone has it.@@@Albania recognizes that human rights are indivisible.@@@We cannot ensure basic rights for all if we select one subset of rights and ignore the rest.@@@The suffering caused by torture or famine is hard to witness.@@@It is unacceptable and unnecessary suffering that can be eliminated if we embrace all civil, political, socioeconomic and cultural rights.@@@Albania is a candidate for the Human Rights Council in the upcoming elections next month.@@@If elected, we will be a champion of human rights in their broadest sense.@@@That includes women’s rights, children’s rights, minority rights and the fundamental right to equal opportunities.@@@We will work with other countries to protect, promote and defend human rights and freedoms as a vital condition for individual and collective development and prosperity.@@@On the regional front, we eagerly anticipate the upcoming European Union-Western Balkans summit, to be held in Tirana in October.@@@We are committed to transforming our region into an example of trust and partnership that transcends borders and communities.@@@Multilateralism is central to our collective endeavours.@@@It is, above all, a vision of how States should cooperate to achieve better results for everyone.@@@Fundamentally, it is about expectations of acceptable behaviour in the future.@@@Multilateralism is a normative key.@@@It requires us to consider not only whether existing arrangements are effective or efficient, but also whether existing multilateral practices and processes are fair and just.@@@It is high time that we engage unconditionally, fully and in good faith to achieve meaningful reforms of our Organization, with the Security Council at its core.@@@No State.@@@Government or individual can be above the law.@@@Albania supports the reform of the United Nations and its main bodies, with the aim of strengthening the Organization’s ability to address the current emerging challenges and threats to international peace, security and development.@@@The power of the Security Council rests in its capacity to intervene decisively in the service of peace and security.@@@The question nowadays should no longer be whether the Council can interfere in the domestic realm of States or not.@@@Rather, the question should be: how can the Council intervene in an intelligent, reflective and timely manner in the service of the values and mandate for which it was created?@@@Since gaining independence in 1912, my country has undergone significant territorial transformation.@@@Currently.@@@Albania boasts captivating urban and rural landscapes, which I wholeheartedly encourage everyone here to explore.@@@I have mentioned that not merely to extend the invitation to visit Albania, but also to underscore the importance of the territorial transformation that lies before us.@@@In the face of climate change, that challenge runs like a red thread through the 17 Sustainable Development Goals.@@@I hope that my country and our nations can effectively address that challenge by safeguarding our natural resources and cultural heritage.@@@Our approach should involve respecting the diversity of those resources and collaborating with communities engaged in both environmental causes and cultural preservation efforts.@@@I firmly believe that that approach reinforces democracy — a political system uniquely capable of ensuring sustainable and fair development.@@@It is in such a world that our younger generations can find joy and prosperity.@@@Our collective efforts can pave the way for them to tell a story of successful collaboration — one that centres around us and this Organization.@@@On behalf of the Government and the people of Pakistan.@@@I convey to Mr. Dennis Francis our warm congratulations on his election to guide the work of this historic session of the General Assembly.@@@I am confident that his vast diplomatic experience and the sunny disposition of his beautiful island country will enable him to steer the Assembly to a most successful conclusion.@@@We are meeting at a tense and pivotal moment in modern history.@@@Conflicts rage in Ukraine and in 50 other places around the world.@@@Tensions among the global Powers have continued to escalate.@@@We see the rise of new and old military and political blocs.@@@Geopolitics are resurgent when geoeconomics should have primacy in the world.@@@The world cannot afford Cold War 2.0.@@@There are far greater challenges confronting humankind that demand global cooperation and collective action.@@@The world’s economic prospects also appear gloomy.@@@Global growth is slow.@@@High interest rates could trigger a recession.@@@A succession of exogenous shocks — the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), conflict and climate change — has devastated the economies of many developing countries.@@@Many countries of the global South have barely managed to stave off defaults.@@@Poverty and hunger have grown, reversing the development gains of three decades.@@@At yesterday’s Sustainable Development Goals Summit, far-reaching commitments were made to implement the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).@@@We must ensure the implementation of the SDG Stimulus, the re-channelling of unused special drawing rights for development, the expansion of concessional lending by the multilateral development banks, and the resolution of the debt problems of the 59 countries in debt distress.@@@Pakistan also looks forward to the fulfilment of the climate change commitments made at the twenty-eighth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change by the developed world to provide over $100 billion in annual climate finance; allocate at least half of such finance to adaptation in developing countries; operationalize the Fund and funding arrangements for loss and damage; and accelerate their carbon emission mitigation targets to keep alive the goal of restricting global warming to 1.5 °C.@@@Attempts to selectively provide those funds on the basis of geopolitical considerations should be resisted.@@@Pakistan’s triple food, fuel and finance challenge is a prime illustration of the impacts of COVID-19, conflicts and climate on developing countries.@@@Pakistan is one of the countries worst affected by the impacts of climate change.@@@The epic floods of last summer submerged a third of our country, killed 1.700 people and displaced over 8 million, destroyed vital infrastructure and caused over $30 billion in damage to Pakistan’s economy.@@@Pakistan is gratified by the commitments of over $10.5 billion for Pakistan’s comprehensive plan for recovery, rehabilitation and reconstruction with resilience — the 4RF Plan — at the Geneva Conference in January.@@@Specific projects are being submitted to ensure the timely funding and execution of the 4RF Plan.@@@I hope that our development partners will accord priority to the allocation of funds for our resilient recovery plan, which has been costed at $13 billion.@@@Pakistan’s Government is committed to rapid economic recovery.@@@We will stabilize our foreign exchange reserves and our currency, expand domestic revenues and, most importantly, mobilize significant domestic and external investment.@@@To that end, we have established a Special Investment Facilitation Council to expedite investment decisions.@@@Twenty eight projects have been identified in priority sectors — agriculture, mining, energy and information technology — for implementation in collaboration with Pakistan’s partners.@@@Pakistan’s long-term shift to geoeconomics is well under way.@@@The second phase of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor has been initiated, covering railway, infrastructure and manufacturing projects.@@@Pakistan also looks forward to the early implementation of connectivity projects with Central Asia.@@@Development depends on peace.@@@Pakistan is situated in one of the least economically integrated regions of the world.@@@Pakistan believes that regions develop together.@@@Therefore.@@@Pakistan desires peaceful and productive relations with all our neighbours, including India.@@@Kashmir is the key to peace between 
Pakistan and India.@@@The Jammu and Kashmir dispute is one of the oldest issues on the agenda of the Security Council.@@@India has evaded implementation of the Security Council’s resolutions, which call for the final disposition of Jammu and Kashmir to be decided by its people through a United Nations-supervised plebiscite.@@@Since 5 August 2019.@@@India has deployed 900.000 troops in illegally occupied Jammu and Kashmir to impose the final solution for Kashmir.@@@To that end.@@@India has imposed extended lockdowns and curfews, jailed all the genuine Kashmir leaders, violently suppressed peaceful protests, resorted to extrajudicial killings of innocent Kashmiris in fake encounters and so-called cordon-and-search operations, and imposed collective punishments, destroying entire villages.@@@Access to occupied Kashmir, demanded by the United Nations High Commission for Human Rights and over a dozen special rapporteurs, has been denied by New Delhi.@@@The Security Council must secure the implementation of its resolutions on Kashmir.@@@The United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan should be reinforced.@@@Global Powers should convince New Delhi to accept Pakistan’s offer of mutual restraint on strategic and conventional weapons.@@@Peace in Afghanistan is a strategic imperative for Pakistan.@@@Pakistan shares the concerns of the international community with respect to Afghanistan, particularly the rights of women and girls.@@@Yet, we advocate continued humanitarian assistance to a destitute Afghan population, in which Afghan girls and women are the most vulnerable, as well as the revival of the Afghan economy and the implementation of the connectivity projects with Central Asia.@@@Pakistan’s first priority is to prevent and counter all terrorism from and within Afghanistan.@@@Pakistan condemns the cross-border terrorist attacks against Pakistan by the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan.@@@Da’esh and other groups operating from Afghanistan.@@@We have sought Kabul’s support and cooperation to prevent those attacks.@@@However, we are also taking necessary measures to end that externally encouraged terrorism.@@@Pakistan welcomes the progress made towards ending the conflicts in Syria and Yemen.@@@In particular, we warmly welcome the normalization of relations between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Islamic Republic of Iran.@@@Unfortunately, the tragedy of Palestine continues, with Israeli military raids, airstrikes, the expansion of settlements and evictions of Palestinians.@@@Durable peace can be established only through a two- State solution and the establishment of a viable and contiguous Palestinian State within the pre-June 1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.@@@United Nations peacekeeping has been a success story.@@@Over more than six decades.@@@Pakistan has contributed 230.000 peacekeepers to 47 missions across the world.@@@Today United Nations peacekeepers face complex and unprecedented challenges, especially from criminal and terrorist groups, as in the Sahel.@@@We must ensure the safety and security of peacekeepers.@@@Pakistan shall continue to work with the United Nations to develop the capabilities and more robust mandates required for successful enforcement actions by United Nations and international forces where needed.@@@We must counter all terrorists without discrimination, including the rising threat posed by far- right extremist and fascist groups, such as Hindutva- inspired extremists threatening genocide against India’s Muslims and Christians.@@@We also need to oppose State terrorism; address the root causes of terrorism, such as poverty, injustice and foreign occupation; and distinguish genuine freedom struggles from terrorism.@@@Pakistan proposes the creation of a committee of the General Assembly to oversee the balanced implementation of all four pillars of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy.@@@Our progress, based on a rich history of cooperation, understanding, exchange and the synthesis of ideas among civilizations, is imperilled today.@@@The narratives advocating a clash of civilizations have done considerable harm to humankind’s progress.@@@Such ideas have bred extremism, hatred and religious intolerance, including Islamophobia.@@@Let us make no mistake; it is a latent threat that undermines millenniums of progress.@@@We need to cherish and celebrate our diversity and different ways of life.@@@Mutual respect and the sanctity of religious symbols, scriptures and personages should be ensured.@@@While Islamophobia is an age-old phenomenon, after the 9/11 terrorist attacks it has assumed epidemic proportions, as manifested in the negative profiling of Muslims and attacks on Islamic sites and symbols, such as the recent public burnings of the Holy Qur’an.@@@Last year, the Assembly adopted resolution 76/254, proposed by Pakistan on behalf of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), declaring 15 March as the International Day to Combat Islamophobia.@@@Earlier this 
year, the Human Rights Council adopted OIC resolution 53/1, submitted by Pakistan, urging States to outlaw the burning of the Holy Qur’an and similar provocations.@@@We welcome the legislation initiated by Denmark and contemplated by Sweden towards that end.@@@Pakistan and the OIC countries will propose further steps to combat Islamophobia, including the appointment of a special envoy, the creation of an Islamophobia data centre, legal assistance to victims and an accountability process to punish Islamophobic crimes.@@@The complex global and regional challenges that the world faces today can be best addressed through effective multilateralism within the framework of the United Nations.@@@However, multilateralism is being eschewed due to the unilateral policies of and strategic rivalry and tensions among global Powers.@@@Pakistan will continue to work actively to strengthen multilateral institutions and enhance global cooperation.@@@Pakistan looks forward to continuing negotiations on the scope and elements of the Summit of the Future and the pact for the future, building on the convergences that emerged in earlier consultations.@@@The Summit’s preparatory process must not disrupt existing negotiating processes, such as the intergovernmental negotiations on the reform of the Security Council.@@@Pakistan does not believe in elitism within the comity of nations.@@@The United Nations Charter principles of equality and sovereignty must be preserved in the interest of global peace and prosperity.@@@Pakistan believes that adding additional permanent members to the Security Council would further erode its credibility and legitimacy.@@@The widest possible agreement can be best achieved on the basis of the Uniting for Consensus group’s proposal for expansion of the Council only in the non-permanent category, with provision for a limited number of longer-term seats.@@@Pakistan believes that to build, preserve and promote peace and prosperity today and in the future, it is vital to reduce great power rivalry and tensions, ensure strict adherence to the United Nations Charter, consistently implement Security Council resolutions, eliminate the root causes of conflicts and respect the principles of the non-use of force, self-determination; sovereignty and territorial integrity, non-interference in the internal affairs of States and peaceful coexistence.@@@Pakistan will work diligently and actively with all Member States to realize those vital elements of a new, equitable and peaceful world order.@@@Let me first express my deep condolences to the people of Morocco who lost their loved ones to the earthquake and the people of Libya for their loss due to the catastrophic flooding.@@@The world is constantly changing.@@@We are living through difficult times and glorious moments — as human beings, as States and societies, as humankind and as global brothers and sisters.@@@On this path, called history, we have learned that moments and situations do not fully repeat themselves fully.@@@Instead, they rhyme.@@@Our ability to learn from the past, to read the rhythm and flow of the verses of time is the source of progress.@@@That gives hope that future rhymes will be nicer and free from the mistakes we made before.@@@We are different as humans.@@@States and societies, but I am certain that some things are universal — like the simple wish for a better tomorrow or the sincere joy of doing good or feeling hope when offered a helping hand in the darkest moment and being told that it is going to be alright.@@@We are all entitled to live with dignity.@@@We are all equal.@@@Recognizing and accepting that is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world, as postulated by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.@@@Those are the things that unite us.@@@Those are the values upon which we must build our future.@@@Our challenges are largely shared — ensuring sustainable peace and security, ending poverty, addressing climate change and finding the best sustainable use for new technologies.@@@Only nations with united effort, a shared vision, an urge to understand each other in our differences and a readiness to compromise will be able to tackle the great challenges of our time.@@@We know that our world is facing diverse, intertwined crises reversing years of sustainable development gains.@@@That is heartbreaking.@@@As I had the privilege to address the Sustainable Development Goals Summit on Monday.@@@I want to focus on other equally important topics today.@@@We have learned from the past mistakes.@@@We have seen horrors and grave human suffering.@@@We do not want to end up in situations that rhyme with barbarity and cruelty.@@@Humankind does not deserve war, death, aggression and suppression.@@@That is why sovereign States gathered 78 years ago and formed the United Nations.@@@The United Nations is really uniting nations.@@@We have been trying to build a world where the ones in need should be noticed and helped.@@@We have learned to hear and accept various voices.@@@We have been shaping a world that is based on freedom, justice and rules.@@@But the world is in danger.@@@Regrettably, we see attempts to bend the rules or even ignore and forget them.@@@We have witnessed ethnic cleansing against the Tigrayan population in western Tigray, which resulted in many deaths, sexual violence, mass detention and the forced displacement of thousands.@@@We have heard the painful stories of slavery and murder of Yazidi girls.@@@Hundreds of thousands have been killed in the war in Yemen.@@@The humanitarian crisis is devastating — famine and diseases are raging on.@@@There are numerous violations of human rights and international humanitarian law.@@@In Afghanistan, girls are denied their basic human right — education.@@@Would anyone accept this faith for their daughter?@@@The Iranian population has lived for decades with severe limitations of fundamental rights.@@@The United Nations Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights stated last year that there are serious human rights violations against Muslim minorities in the Xinjiang region, and there are massive restrictions of the fundamental rights of people in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.@@@These are not merely statistics or abstract passages in annual reports, but real and utterly tragic stories happening to our fellow citizens, to people like us.@@@These are people like Anna, who worked in a shop in Kyiv.@@@When war started, she remembers constant running to different shelters, schools, churches and nearby houses.@@@Bombs were constantly falling, and one could only hope that the explosions would stop.@@@Shelters were overcrowded with small babies, older men and women, cats and dogs.@@@Everybody was nervous, and the shops were empty.@@@With her daughter and cat.@@@Anna decided to leave her hometown of Kyiv, which was in flames.@@@Like the thousands of others running for their lives.@@@Anna took the difficult journey and made it to Estonia.@@@There she especially enjoys the sunsets and is amazed at how quiet it is.@@@Sometimes when it thunders, she prays that it is just thunder.@@@Russia escalated its aggression against Ukraine into a full-scale war more than a year and a half ago already.@@@As we speak, a permanent member of the Security Council, the Russian Federation, is shamelessly destroying hospitals, kindergartens, grain storage facilities and schools.@@@We have to be very clear: Russia invaded another sovereign country, using a fabricated pretext.@@@The real reason for the aggression against Ukraine lies in Russia’s neo-imperial and neocolonial aspirations.@@@Russia wants to destroy Ukraine, occupy it and drain it of its resources to fuel the ideology of its greatness.@@@What is there great about colonizing another country?@@@The outcome of the war will greatly determine the future world in which we and our kids will live.@@@Will it be dominated by the brutal use of violence by those who commit crimes and destroy others?@@@Or will we live in a world in which law and order, justice and universally accepted rules will prevail?@@@What kind of lessons will we have learned from Russia’s aggression?@@@How will we be able to discredit that aggression as a tool for rogue statecraft for generations to come?@@@The answer is that Russia’s political and military leadership must bear individual criminal responsibility for planning, launching and waging the war of aggression against Ukraine.@@@It is a crime against peace.@@@It is a crime of aggression.@@@It is a leadership crime.@@@Russia abuses its authority in the Security Council and tries to convince the world that black is white.@@@But it is not.@@@A lie is always a lie, no matter how nice it sounds.@@@The votes in the General Assembly have proven that there are fewer and fewer of those who tend to believe Russian lies.@@@The Charter of the United Nations states that the purpose of the United Nations is to prevent and eradicate threats to peace and suppress of acts of aggression.@@@Russia has continuously breached that core principle.@@@The fact that Russia is member of the Security Council does not legitimize its actions.@@@A crime is a crime, no matter what.@@@Therefore, a tribunal should be created, and should it be based on the authority of the General Assembly, it would have the desired international legitimacy.@@@If we allow impunity to prevail, we put a question mark on our own virtues, values and moral norms.@@@The whole concept of international adjudication and arbitration would be under threat, which would deeply undermine international law.@@@That is why the international reaction and response to Russia’s crimes are of existential significance for us all.@@@The situation calls on us to really use the tools at our disposal for protecting international law, based on the United Nations Charter.@@@Therefore, we need to reform the Security Council.@@@Now is the time, as the 
world is out of joint.@@@Now is the time, as it has become more evident than ever.@@@The Security Council is close to a dead end, unable to act and make decisions on the greatest conflict in the heart of Europe since the Second World War.@@@That undermines the Charter.@@@Maintaining international peace and security is the raison d’etre of the Security Council.@@@But instead the Council is paralysed, which has numerous negative implications globally, including the inability to provide conflict resolution or solutions concerning migration and food security.@@@That dangerous trend does not have its foundation in Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, but it has crystallized because of that.@@@The world needs a Security Council that is able to fulfil its tasks, live up to the expectations of its founding members and, above all, give hope for better days to those suffering under fear, oppression and violence.@@@Those responsible for aggression and conflicts must face justice — even those that enjoy the right of the veto in the Security Council.@@@In order to ensure that the Security Council can fulfil the tasks conferred upon it by the Charter, there is no alternative other than to adjust the Council’s structure and working methods.@@@And yes, that is possible.@@@We should rise up together and join voices in calling for Security Council reform.@@@Of course, it is hard.@@@We are different in our positions.@@@Reform has already been on the table for many decades.@@@But instead of complaining how impossible Security Council reform will be, let us make an extra effort towards it.@@@We owe it to the starving, physically injured, mentally damaged and homeless boys and girls in Rakhine.@@@Tigray.@@@Syria.@@@Yemen and Ukraine.@@@Whose children will be next?@@@We need to stick together and protect international law, based on the Charter.@@@If we cannot agree on all the ideas for reform, let us concentrate on commonalities.@@@Let us take the small steps that we can already take today.@@@We all need to show some flexibility.@@@Both issues — the composition of the Security Council and its working methods — must be seriously addressed.@@@It is time to abandon the well- known and documented group positions.@@@We, as the united world community, need to start afresh.@@@Let us turn a blank page and work closely together to strongly make the point that enough is enough.@@@For the greater good, it would make perfect sense to take one step back from old positions in order to move three steps forward.@@@Let us keep in mind what is at stake here.@@@The central issue is of course the exercise of the right to the veto.@@@There should be no right to the veto if it is suspected that the country exercising it may have acted against international law.@@@Estonia supports the proposal of the Accountability.@@@Coherence and Transparency group to limit the right of the veto in cases of war crimes, crimes against humanity and the crime of aggression.@@@The Charter stipulates in Chapter V that a party to a dispute shall abstain from voting in the Security Council.@@@We call on the Council to always implement that provision, as was done in the early decades of the United Nations.@@@It is unacceptable for an aggressor to exercise the right of the veto, making it impossible for the Security Council to act.@@@In fact, there is a way to prevent a Security Council member from abusing its right of the veto.@@@Let us use it.@@@As for the future composition of the Security Council, there should always be a fair distribution among continents and regions.@@@Small, medium-sized and large States should all be represented.@@@Only then will we have a balanced Council truly able to address the world.@@@In addition, the Security Council should be more transparent and open, which will immensely increase its efficiency.@@@Building on that, the belief that the Security Council is able to maintain international peace and security will be restored.@@@The international community has a right to know what was discussed at the Council.@@@If there were a clear solution on the table and there were a Member State that simply blocked it, and in doing so increased the suffering of people, then that should be stated publicly.@@@In situations in which the Security Council is unable to function as expected, it is definitely a positive development that the General Assembly has gained more prominence and influence in addressing issues related to peace and security.@@@We saw that, for example, in the process of adopting resolutions on Ukraine and implementing the initiative concerning the right to the veto.@@@We in the General Assembly should be able to collectively overcome the veto in the Security Council, if the situation requires.@@@The concept of war and peace already started to change during the nineteenth century.@@@War was gradually seen to be a state of confusion or disorientation of mind.@@@It became clearer and clearer that nobody actually wins a war or gains anything from it.@@@States started to understand that their national interests are better served in times of peace than in times of war.@@@Peace generated welfare.@@@After the World Wars, the international community said “never again”.@@@The United Nations was created to serve that exact purpose.@@@The question we must ask ourselves is, do we need to create a new, better world order that is up to the task?@@@Are we wise and willing enough to use international law to resolve conflicts to maintain peace and security?@@@Are we heading towards dark days or glorious ones?@@@That is entirely up to us.@@@We are the ones who determine the future.@@@We are the ones responsible for it.@@@But let us start by fixing the Security Council.@@@For the past 78 years, the world’s leaders have gathered together in this Assembly Hall in September every year because of their deep- rooted conviction that the nations of the world can, and should, cooperate to resolve conflicts peacefully and 
to change people’s lives for the better.@@@That vision of our forebears, that of a united, peaceful and prosperous world, continues to resonate with us and will indeed transcend countless future generations.@@@That is so because the strides of the United Nations are too glaring to deny.@@@From preventing third world war to buttressing the foundations of global security, as well as advancing global economic development, the United Nations has left an indelible mark in the annals of history.@@@Despite those remarkable achievements, the United Nations path towards the full realization of its aspirations has always been beset by numerous challenges.@@@The world is currently in a state of turbulence, with intersecting crises growing in scale and severity.@@@With the conflicts and insurgency in the Sahel, the Democratic Republic of the Congo.@@@Mozambique and Ukraine, and the rising global tensions among nuclear- weapon States, the capacity of the United Nations to maintain global peace and security is put to the test.@@@Climate change, poverty, hunger, diseases, lack of employment, mainly for the youth, and abuse of human rights threaten to overwhelm the international system.@@@As if that is not enough, unconstitutional changes of Government have resurfaced again, while unilateralism and terrorism continue unabated.@@@That state of affairs has given rise to perceptions that the multilateral system is no longer fit for purpose.@@@The question now is how does one restore the confidence to the world population that the United Nations is still as relevant today as it was in 1945, when it was formed.@@@The answer to that question squarely rests on us as the current leadership of the world.@@@It is up to us to make this decade a turning point or a decade in which multilateralism lost its way.@@@It is in that context that we hail as most appropriate the theme chosen for our general debate “Rebuilding trust and reigniting global solidarity: accelerating action on the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals towards peace, prosperity, progress and sustainability for all”.@@@At the heart of our problems lies the challenge of an uneven and uncertain economic outlook.@@@The report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization (A/78/1) aptly captures the fact that the promotion of sustained economic growth and sustainable development has remained a major challenge during the reporting period.@@@It clearly indicates that progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) has not only stalled, but reversed in terms of poverty, employment, health, education and other areas.@@@Small and landlocked developing economies, such as Lesotho, bear the biggest brunt, as they are yet to fully integrate into the global markets.@@@Reversing the current economic trajectory requires us to be intentional about multilateral cooperation and to remain true to the principles underpinning the formation of the United Nations.@@@We need to be purposeful in working towards levelling the playing field with regard to the global financing architecture and thus speak with one voice in calling for the democratization and reform of the Bretton Woods institutions.@@@Moreover.@@@Lesotho continues to fully support the proposal of the Secretary-General on the SDG stimulus.@@@At the same time, we would like to add our voice to the call for the Group of 20 (G20) countries to provide the SDG stimulus to the tune of at least $500 billion per year, to be delivered through a combination of grants and concessional and non-concessional finance.@@@The international commitments undertaken must be fulfilled.@@@We also welcome the recent G20 decision to accredit the African Union as its official member.@@@Despite our challenges as least developed countries, we are not sitting back as spectators in the process of achieving the SDGs.@@@Some of our efforts at the country level include the hosting of a high-level event on nutrition and food security by His Majesty King Letsie III in Lesotho in March this year.@@@The aim of the event was to promote strong political momentum to mobilize commitments and investment in the fight against hunger and malnutrition on the continent.@@@We are also making concerted efforts to sponsor the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals through our national fiscal allocations and actions.@@@Two months ago, in collaboration with the United Nations country office in Lesotho.@@@I launched the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework, which is aimed at the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@While we hail the United Nations for that gesture, we wish to indicate that significant resource gaps still exist.@@@We therefore call on our development partners to make more resources available towards that endeavour.@@@Climate change is also one of the formidable challenges of our time.@@@That is evidenced by the changing weather patterns, hurricanes, storms and catastrophes that we endure every year.@@@The recent earthquake in Morocco and the floods in Libya are 
a case in point.@@@Allow me at this point to convey our sincere condolences to the families that lost their loved ones in those disasters.@@@We also express solidarity and support to those sisterly African countries and their peoples as they recover and rebuild.@@@In the midst of the climate change crisis, we believe that there is a silver lining on the horizon that may enable us to turn around the fortunes of our people.@@@In Lesotho, we have water, sunlight and wind in abundance, which provide opportunities for innovation and partnerships in renewable energy generation and the creation of jobs.@@@In that regard.@@@I wish to announce that on 12 and 13 October this year.@@@Lesotho will host an international water and hydrogen conference and exposition that will showcase the steps that we are undertaking towards becoming the world’s first sustainable digital hydro nation.@@@We are open to investments in that sector.@@@I therefore take this opportunity to invite Member States and the private sector in their respective countries to attend that ground-breaking event.@@@Our aim is to generate clean energy for domestic use and for export to the neighbouring countries.@@@At the same time, we urge developed countries to meet their financial commitments to providing $100 billion a year to developing States for the implementation of the Paris Agreement.@@@We need to work for implementation that puts people with disability, the youth, women and other vulnerable groups at the centre.@@@We believe that the inclusion of all stakeholders in a programmatic and results-oriented action will bring about fundamental changes in the livelihoods and well-being of our societies.@@@We live in a digital age that compels our countries to ensure broad access to digital tools.@@@The coronavirus disease has taught us that technology is key to fighting diseases and pandemics.@@@The challenges besieging our health systems require improvement in the use of telemedicine and technology.@@@Global cooperation is key in that area.@@@Even as we cooperate in that area, we need to ensure that access to health and medicine must continue to be a priority and adequately funded.@@@We are gratified to share that in Lesotho, digital access has raised awareness among the youth, especially girls, and among women of their rights.@@@That is evident in increased civic engagement and the expression of ideas and opinions by most Basotho women and girls in various sectors.@@@That notwithstanding, full access to digital tools remains a challenge for our rural communities due to the lack of infrastructure and affordability, further perpetuating inequalities that we strive to eradicate.@@@That is one area that needs close collaboration and cooperation with Member States.@@@Even as we hail and support technological innovations, such as artificial intelligence and social media.@@@I must however add that we should not lose sight of the need to address clear threats to people’s rights to safety and privacy.@@@In our quest to achieve our development aspirations, we are also taking initiatives to stimulate medium, small and micro enterprises.@@@That will help to accelerate trade and industrialization, as well as address the prevailing gender imbalances.@@@Lesotho has also embarked on a comprehensive constitutional and legislative reforms process.@@@While not being a one-stop solution for all problems, reforms nevertheless provide the hope that people’s lives will improve due to a new order of public resources management, improved checks and balances, political stability and a focus on the development agenda.@@@As we transition to the implementation of the reforms, we will continue to bank on the support of the United Nations and the international community.@@@The consolidation of peace will continue to be a prerequisite to development.@@@While access to small arms and light weapons, which kill our people on a daily basis, remains unfettered, peace will continue to elude us.@@@While a lack of political will to rid the world of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, including biological and chemical weapons, still exists, global peace and security will forever remain fragile.@@@We call for the implementation of the Programme of Action to Prevent.@@@Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects and for the total elimination of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, in line with the international commitments and obligations undertaken.@@@As part of the global community.@@@Lesotho will continue to play a role in fostering global peace, including peace in our region.@@@We are grateful to report to this Assembly that our troops in Mozambique, under the umbrella of the Southern African Development Community, have made commendable strides in thwarting the threat of the deadly insurrection in that country.@@@As we continue to ponder the most pressing issues and challenges facing the international community today, we should not forget the plight of the Sahrawi and the Palestinian people, who continue to live 
under oppression.@@@Both the General Assembly and the Security Council have recognized their rights to self-determination and independence.@@@Western Sahara should determine its own destiny and live in peace side by side with the Kingdom of Morocco.@@@Equally, the solution to the Palestine question is the implementation of the two-State solution, with Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace, security and harmony.@@@It would be remiss of me not to call for the lifting of the economic embargo against the Republic of Cuba, as well as the remaining sanctions against the Republic of Zimbabwe.@@@At the same time, we call for the reform of the Security Council along the lines of the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration.@@@We deserve a Council that is more transparent, representative and democratic.@@@We have learned a lesson from exclusion, intolerance and war that selfishness in world relations is suicidal.@@@We have also learned a lesson about the value of collective decision-making and inclusive development.@@@As I conclude my statement, allow me to note that although the world may have changed since 1945, the United Nations remains the only universal intergovernmental institution that unites us in a global community of States.@@@Yes, the Organization may have shortcomings, but it remains a beacon of hope for humankind.@@@The responsibility to make the United Nations function optimally falls on all of us and must be discharged with a great sense of responsibility.@@@I would like to sincerely congratulate the President on assuming the presidency of the General Assembly at this session.@@@I also value the efforts of Mr. Csaba Korosi during his presidency of the previous session.@@@I would like to reiterate our sincere condolences and sympathy to the Governments and the peoples of the Kingdom of Morocco and the State of Libya for the victims of the recent disasters that struck the two countries.@@@The United Arab Emirates declared this year as the Year of Sustainability, under the theme “Today for tomorrow”, to honour our shared responsibilities to current and future generations, who deserve to live in safe and prosperous environments.@@@We also seek to honour previous generations, which spared no effort in advancing nations and their aspirations.@@@We are committed to saving our planet and its resources and ancient heritage.@@@The United Arab Emirates believes in the importance of that approach amid the existential challenges facing our world today.@@@That particularly applies to addressing armed conflicts, currently at their highest since the Second World War, and climate change and its disasters.@@@We are steadfast in defending our common humanitarian values in a world dominated by the unrelenting waves of extremism, racism and hate speech.@@@Addressing those challenges has become possible now more than at any other time.@@@We have reached the highest level of advancement.@@@Today we possess the advanced technology required to find innovative solutions to complex challenges.@@@We have put in place regional and international institutions to coordinate collective action, and we are equipped with the necessary legal frameworks to organize relations among States.@@@The United Arab Emirates has experienced that reality extensively during its term as a member of the Security Council since last year.@@@Time and time again, geopolitical disagreements have prevented the Council from achieving the desired consensus regarding urgent issues, including purely humanitarian ones.@@@The time has come to engage in serious discussions on comprehensive and meaningful reform of the Security Council, particularly in terms of the challenges related to the use of the veto, the expansion of the permanent and elected memberships and the improvement of the Council’s approach and working methods and its ability to proactively address crises.@@@The United Arab Emirates emphasizes the importance of maintaining an international order that is based on respect for the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of States.@@@International relations must be governed by international law, including United Nations resolutions.@@@Resorting to the use of force instead of relying on political solutions and dividing the world into an “us against them” mentality could yield nothing but chaos and the undermining of diplomatic efforts.@@@No party will be a winner.@@@We underscore the need to respect diversity, political differences and development disparities.@@@We must give prominence to common values that ensure cooperation and integration across peoples and countries.@@@It is essential to enhance the effectiveness of international organizations, in particular the United Nations.@@@Such institutions are crucial to building bridges, reducing tensions and establishing peaceful solutions.@@@We depend on them as the first line of defence to prevent States from being drawn into divisive currents amid major political rifts.@@@We also believe that regional organizations, such as the League of Arab States and the African Union, play a pivotal role in supporting faltering political endeavours and efforts because those organizations are familiar with local contexts.@@@My country believes that the best way to resolve crises is through peaceful means, particularly in our region, which is ravaged by weapons and extremist rhetoric.@@@We spare no effort in reducing escalation and call for prioritizing dialogue and diplomacy to resolve differences.@@@At the same time, we focus on strengthening economic integration among the countries of our region in order to create integration that would benefit the economies and peoples of the region and enhance regional stability and prosperity.@@@From this rostrum, the United Arab Emirates reiterates its request to Iran to end its occupation of our three islands, namely.@@@Greater Tunb.@@@Lesser Tunb and Abu Musa.@@@Our legitimate right to those islands has not diminished, and time will not lessen our sovereignty over the islands.@@@We will continue to seek a resolution either through direct negotiation or through the International Court of Justice.@@@That has been the firm stance of the United Arab Emirates for decades.@@@We stress the position of the Gulf Cooperation Council calling on Iraq to take serious and urgent steps to address the negative consequences of the ruling of its Federal Supreme Court regarding the agreement concluded between Kuwait and Iraq on the regulation of maritime navigation in Khor Abdullah.@@@That needs to be done in a manner that serves good-neighbourly relations, in line with international law and the agreements signed between the two brotherly countries.@@@Our ultimate goal is to strive for applying the principle of zero problems.@@@Regardless of how great the challenge, it is critical to restore the legitimate sovereignty of States and prevent extremist and armed groups from maintaining a presence in our region.@@@We must move forward with a vision that promotes peace, openness, coexistence, cooperation and development.@@@We believe that achieving such a vision is not a farfetched goal.@@@Our region is full of hope and resources, and our youth has great potential to lead our nations towards security, stability and prosperity.@@@That can be achieved only with political will and determined efforts.@@@The United Arab Emirates therefore refuses to accept that conflicts in our region are inevitable.@@@We believe that security, stability and prosperity will be restored in Yemen.@@@Syria, the Sudan.@@@Libya.@@@Iraq and Lebanon.@@@We also believe in the establishment of an independent Palestinian State within the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital.@@@Without eradicating extremism, hatred and racism from our region and globally, such efforts will not succeed.@@@It has become abundantly clear that hate speech and extremism are closely linked to the spread and escalation of conflict.@@@Last June, the Security Council acknowledged that fact in its historic resolution 2686 (2023), concerning tolerance, international peace and security, as per a pioneer initiative in which the United Arab Emirates played a crucial role.@@@Although the values of tolerance and peaceful coexistence have an impact on peoples globally, applying those values has a greater impact when established among communities.@@@That means refraining from double standards, such as destroying a church in 
Iraq, burning the Holy Qur’an in Sweden or attacking a Jewish cultural centre in Argentina.@@@All those are unacceptable acts, which lead to chaos and discord.@@@We must develop comprehensive and effective strategies that guarantee human rights, strengthen stability within communities and address racist practices.@@@That also includes addressing exclusion and discrimination against women and girls in Afghanistan.@@@We call for concerted efforts to address grave developments that threaten global stability, foremost of which is the development of nuclear weapons and the undermining of the non-proliferation regime.@@@We must never tolerate that kind of threat or accept the risk of a nuclear conflict, which would result in devastating consequences for all.@@@We also stress the importance of alleviating the suffering of people affected by conflict situations, particularly by granting humanitarian exceptions when sanctions measures are imposed.@@@We should be mindful that civilians, especially children, are not responsible for those conflicts and have nothing to do with their outbreak or sustainability.@@@In the aftermath of the devastating earthquake in Syria this year, the Arab countries set an example through their humanitarian diplomacy and supported the brotherly Syrian people.@@@As part of the United Arab Emirates approach to support affected peoples and alleviate their suffering by all means, we plan to launch a digital platform that employs advanced technologies to enable affected States to better inform the international community of their humanitarian support needs in the wake of natural disasters.@@@The digital platform will assist in providing an urgent, effective and coordinated humanitarian response.@@@I would emphasize that the interplay among those conflicts and other serious challenges, particularly climate change, food and energy security and water crises, can bring about significant consequences for future generations.@@@The climate crisis is at a critical juncture in our world today.@@@The result of the first global stocktaking only confirms how far off-track we are in implementing the objectives of the Paris Agreement.@@@To keep the 1.5°C target within reach, we need to undertake a radical change.@@@Some may see that objective as impossible, but my country sees it as possible to achieve.@@@In that spirit, the United Arab Emirates will host the twenty-eighth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in almost two months’ time.@@@We will focus on intensifying international cooperation to achieve the highest ambitions possible.@@@The action plan for the conference will focus on four main axes, namely, expediting an orderly and just transition in the energy sector, advancing climate financing mechanisms, enhancing livelihoods and protecting individuals based on a transparent and inclusive framework.@@@We must restore hope and be optimistic regarding our ability to deal with climate change.@@@The United Arab Emirates believes that the transformation of the energy sector will provide the greatest opportunity to enhance and sustain human and economic development.@@@It is important to focus on financing as an essential tool in that process.@@@That would require improving the international financial structure, encouraging the private sector to finance climate action, ensuring the fulfilment of pledges by donors and fully operationalizing the loss and damage fund.@@@In line with the values and approach of the United Arab Emirates, we will utilize the valuable contributions of women, youth and civil society, as well as the private sector.@@@Global Government agencies should also fulfil their responsibilities to tackle climate change.@@@We must remain united and work together to make the desired progress.@@@I would like to take this opportunity to extend an open invitation to the world to actively participate in the conference and develop collective solutions to achieve a substantial shift in confronting climate change that allows us to move our focus from negotiations to achieving tangible results in pursuit of a better and more sustained future through consensus and inclusivity.@@@By addressing climate change, we can alleviate the food insecurity crisis.@@@That requires further investment in food supply systems and safeguarding them from damage or attacks.@@@It also demands a focus on the development of smart systems to increase productivity and minimize the impact of natural disasters and political and security crises.@@@Water scarcity is an increasingly challenging problem globally.@@@However, it does not get the attention that it deserves in order to address the scale and gravity of the challenges posed by it on our planet.@@@There is an urgent need to find new models of international cooperation on water.@@@That issue must be a top priority for multilateral action.@@@In recognition of that, the 
United Arab Emirates seeks to find effective solutions by working with international partners to address that problem.@@@Today the Foreign Ministry of the United Arab Emirates published a relevant report, which we hope will contribute to achieving that goal.@@@Global challenges are becoming interlinked to a great extent.@@@No country or organization is capable of addressing them alone.@@@Terrorist organizations that try to control our region recruit fighters and finance their networks from other regions.@@@The repercussions of the coronavirus disease pandemic affected countries throughout the world.@@@Civilian suffering in conflicts does not differ, regardless of their causes.@@@The United Arab Emirates believes that collective action is no longer simply an option, but an urgent need.@@@Today’s decisions will have far-reaching impacts for decades to come.@@@In that regard, we should ask ourselves what legacy we want to leave for future generations.@@@Do we want our legacy to be conflicts, crises and scarce resources and opportunities?@@@Or do we want to leave behind a stable and prosperous international order, where tolerant communities coexist and are resilient in the face of challenges?@@@For us in the United Arab Emirates, peace is our choice, development is our path, and the future is our destination.@@@With the return of the Emirati astronaut Sultan Al Neyadi from the first long Arab mission in space, we see invaluable experience, as we see in our youth new potential leaders who build on our achievements and usher in a promising future.@@@We are determined to follow in the footsteps of the founders of the United Arab Emirates.@@@We strive to achieve greater advancements and further investments in humankind and science for the people of the world.@@@Our determination to achieve those objectives is demonstrated in our policies, decisions and relationships.@@@Seventy-eight years ago, in the aftermath of the Second World War, the nations of the world made a solemn commitment to saving future generations from the horror and suffering of war.@@@Through the Charter of the United Nations, those nations accepted a shared mandate to foster peace and promote fundamental human rights and social progress and ensure a better standard of life for all.@@@Yet, as we gather here, much of humankind is confronted by war and conflict, by want and hunger and by disease and environmental damage and disaster.@@@Solidarity and trust among States are being eroded.@@@Inequality, poverty and unemployment are deepening across many nations in the world.@@@In those conditions, and in the wake of a devastating global pandemic, the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals seems increasingly remote.@@@At the moment, when every human effort should be directed towards the realization of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, our attention and our energies have once again been diverted by the scourge of war.@@@But those woes, those divisions and those seemingly intractable troubles can, and must, be overcome.@@@Over millenniums, the human race has demonstrated an enormous capacity for resilience, an ability to resolve problems, adaptation, innovation, compassion and solidarity.@@@At this moment, we are all called upon to reaffirm those essential qualities, which define our common humanity.@@@Such qualities must be evident in how we work together as a global community and as nations of the world to end war and conflict.@@@South Africa has consistently advocated for dialogue, negotiation and diplomacy to prevent and end conflict and achieve lasting peace.@@@As a country, it has committed itself to the promotion of human rights, human dignity, justice, democracy and adherence to international law.@@@From the experience of our own journey from the evil system of apartheid, which was declared a crime against humanity by this very Organization, to democracy, we value the importance of engaging all parties to conflicts in achieving peaceful, just and enduring resolutions.@@@It is those principles that inform South Africa’s participation in the African peace initiative, which seeks a peaceful resolution of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.@@@In that conflict, as in all conflicts, we have insisted that the United Nations Charter principle of respect for the territorial integrity of every country should be upheld.@@@Our participation in the African peace initiative, supported by seven countries from the African continent, is informed by a desire to see an end to the suffering of those most directly affected by the conflict and the millions on our continent and across the world who, as a result of the conflict, are now vulnerable to worsening hunger and deprivation.@@@As we, as African leaders, engaged with the parties to the conflict, one of the issues that we raised was that there should be confidence-building measures that could create a sense of trust towards the resolution of the conflict.@@@In that regard, we said that issues such as the return of the children who were removed from Ukraine should be ensured.@@@We also said that the prisoners of war should be exchanged between the two countries.@@@I just held a meeting with President Zelenskyy, who said that, in part, some of our efforts were bearing fruit, as the children were now being returned and the prisoners were also being exchanged.@@@But then we said that we needed to see that happening at a much faster pace.@@@As the international community, we must do everything within our means to enable meaningful dialogue, just as we should refrain from any actions that fuel conflict.@@@As we confront other conflicts in several parts of the world, including on our own continent.@@@Africa, we need to invest in prevention and peace-building.@@@We support the call by the Secretary- General in the New Agenda for Peace for Member States to provide more sustainable and predictable financing for peace building efforts.@@@As a global community, we should be concerned by the recent incidents of unconstitutional changes of Government in some parts of Africa.@@@The global community needs to work alongside the African Union to support peace efforts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.@@@Libya, the Sudan.@@@Somalia.@@@Mali, the Central African Republic.@@@South Sudan, northern Mozambique, the Great Lakes region, the Sahel, the Niger and the Horn of Africa.@@@The African Union Peace and Security Council has declared that it stands ready to deepen its cooperation with the United Nations Security Council to silence the guns on the African continent and to achieve peace, stability and development.@@@We are called upon to remain true to the founding principles of the United Nations by recognizing the inalienable right of the people of Western Sahara to self-determination, in line with the relevant General Assembly resolutions.@@@We must work for peace in the Middle East.@@@For as long as the land of the Palestinians remains occupied, and for as long as their rights are ignored and their dignity is denied, such peace will remain elusive.@@@The actions of the Government of Israel have imperilled the possibility of a viable two-State solution.@@@The principles of the United Nations Charter with regard to territorial integrity and the prohibition on the annexation of 
land through the use of force must also be applied in that situation.@@@South Africa continues to call for the lifting of the economic embargo that was imposed 60 years ago against Cuba, which has caused untold damage to the country’s economy as well as the people of Cuba.@@@The sanctions that are also being applied against South Africa’s neighbour Zimbabwe should also be lifted, as they are imposing untold suffering on ordinary Zimbabweans, but they also have a collateral negative impact on neighbouring countries, such as my own country.@@@South Africa.@@@As many people around the world are confronted by hunger and want, the essential human qualities of cooperation and solidarity must be evident in the actions that we take to bridge the divide between the wealthy and the poor.@@@We must summon the necessary will and resolve to regain the momentum towards the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@That means that we must address the fundamental development challenges that have also long characterized our unequal world.@@@To address the development challenges that face many people in the world we are required to focus on targeted investment, technology transfer and capacity building support, especially in key areas such as supporting industrialization, building infrastructure, ensuring that investment in agriculture takes place and making sure that there is investment in water, energy, education and health.@@@That also requires predictable and sustained financial support, including supportive trade policies, from the international community.@@@We call on our partners from wealthier countries to meet the financial commitments that they made.@@@It is a great concern to us from the global South that those wealthier countries in the global North have failed to meet the undertakings that they made to provide $100 billion a year for developing economies to take climate action.@@@That must be changed, and the money must be made available in the interests of development.@@@We support the proposals outlined in the Secretary- General’s Sustainable Development Goals stimulus.@@@In particular, we support the call to tackle debt and debt distress, by which many countries, particularly in the global South, are burdened.@@@We support the call to massively scale up affordable long-term financing to $500 billion a year and to expand contingency financing to countries that are in need.@@@It is a grave indictment of the international community that we can spend so much on war — in fact, trillions are being spent on war — but we cannot support the action that needs to be taken to meet the most basic needs of billions of people in the world, such as addressing hunger and health, empowering women and ensuring that there is development in vulnerable countries.@@@The achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals depends fundamentally on the empowerment of women in all spheres of life.@@@Social and economic progress will not be possible unless we end gender discrimination.@@@We must ensure that there is equal access for women to health care, education and economic opportunities.@@@We must pay particular attention to the provision of adequate health services to every woman, child and adolescent.@@@By doing so, we will fundamentally improve the health and well-being of all.@@@The empowerment of women must be central to the actions that we now take towards the realization of the 2030 Agenda.@@@The women of the world need empowerment.@@@They have a right to empowerment.@@@They also have a right to participate equally in the decision-making structures of all institutions in the world.@@@I am proud that, in South Africa.@@@50 per cent of the members of the Cabinet of South Africa are women.@@@Today I am accompanied by an all-women delegation to this General Assembly session.@@@It should be a matter of concern to us all that the majority of people who are sitting in this Assembly are men.@@@The question that we must ask is: where are the women of the world?@@@The women of the world have a right to be here to represent the views of women across the world.@@@The essential human qualities of innovation and adaptation must be evident in the actions that we take to prevent the destruction of our planet.@@@Africa is warming faster than the rest of the world.@@@We are told that, of the 20 climate hotspots in the world, we find 17 in Africa.@@@Africa is the least responsible for the climate damage that has been caused; yet it bears the greatest burden.@@@Centuries after the end of the slave trade, decades after the end of the colonial exploitation of Africa’s resources, the people of our continent are once again bearing the costs of the industrialization of the North and the development of the wealthy nations 
of the world.@@@That is a price that the people of Africa are no longer prepared to pay.@@@Many countries in the North count their assets in the mineral resources that are beneath African soil.@@@The wealth of Africa belongs to Africans.@@@The mineral wealth that is beneath the soil of Africa must in the end accrue to Africans.@@@We urge global leaders to accelerate global decarbonization, while pursuing equality and shared prosperity.@@@We need to advance all three pillars of the Paris Agreement — mitigation, adaptation and support — with equal ambition and urgency.@@@African countries, alongside other countries with developing economies, need increased financial support both to implement the 2030 Agenda and to achieve their climate change goals in a comprehensive and integrated manner.@@@We need to operationalize the loss and damage fund for vulnerable countries hit hard by climate disasters, as agreed at the twenty-seventh session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.@@@Africa has embraced that challenge.@@@Africa is determined to deploy smart, digital and efficient green technologies to expand industrial production, boost agricultural yields, drive growth and create sustained employment for Africa’s people.@@@As the global community, we must ensure that the essential qualities that define our humanity are evident in the institutions that manage the conduct of international relations.@@@We require institutions that are inclusive, representative and democratic and that advance the interests of all nations.@@@We require a renewed commitment to multilateralism, based on clear rules and supported by effective institutions.@@@This is the moment to proceed with the reform of the Security Council, give meaning to the principle of the sovereign equality of nations and enable the Council to respond more effectively to the current geopolitical realities.@@@We are pleased that the Common African Position on the reform of the Security Council is increasingly enjoying wide support.@@@That process must move to text-based negotiations, creating an opportunity for convergence among Member States.@@@The Brazil.@@@Russian Federation.@@@India.@@@China and South Africa Summit, held recently in Johannesburg, also affirmed the view that the Security Council should be reformed and should ensure that nations that are not represented are also represented.@@@We must ensure that the voice of the African continent and the global South is strengthened in the United Nations and the broader multilateral system.@@@All the peoples represented here in this United Nations had their origins in Africa.@@@In Africa, they developed the tools and capabilities to spread across the world and achieve remarkable feats of development and progress.@@@All that was due to the skills and the talent that originated from the African continent.@@@Despite its history, despite the legacy of exploitation, colonialism and subjugation, despite the ongoing challenge of conflict and instability.@@@Africa is determined and ready to regain its position as a site of human progress.@@@The era of African development has arrived.@@@Through the African Continental Free Trade Area, which is creating a wider seamless trading area, as well as accelerated interconnectivity.@@@African countries are mobilizing their collective means and resources to achieve shared prosperity.@@@Through that treaty.@@@African countries are establishing for themselves the foundation for a massive increase in trade, accelerated infrastructure development, regional integration and sustainable industrialization.@@@As the global community, we have the means and the desire to confront and overcome the enormous challenges that face humankind today.@@@As the nations gathered here in this General Assembly, let us demonstrate that we have both the will and the resolve to secure a peaceful, prosperous and sustainable future for our world and, more important, for the future generations that will follow, leaving no one behind.@@@That is the duty that we all now have.@@@More than 10 years ago, when I addressed the General Assembly for the first time as President of Finland (see A/67/PV.6), the world seemed complicated.@@@In the Middle East and North Africa, many nations had gone through tremendous changes following of a wave of uprisings.@@@Europe was 
struggling with the deepest financial crisis of its postwar history.@@@People all over the world were affected by instability and conflicts.@@@Yet our common task in this Hall was to create a constructive atmosphere, understand one another and find solutions to the challenges we were facing.@@@And that is why we gather here in New York.@@@It is not just to make speeches or to be seen, but to collectively ensure that our global community is moving in the right direction.@@@Today, as I address this body for the last time.@@@I have to ask: have we succeeded in our task?@@@The world has grown even more complicated.@@@Global tensions are running high and great-Power competition is accelerating.@@@Different world views seem to be on a collision course.@@@The theme of this year’s session is “Rebuilding trust and reigniting global solidarity: Accelerating action on the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals towards peace, prosperity, progress and sustainability for all”.@@@That must not remain empty rhetoric.@@@We need to put those words into practice.@@@We all have much to gain from cooperation on an equal footing.@@@The many global challenges that we are facing — from climate change to pandemics, poverty and wars — cannot be solved by one country or group of like-minded countries alone.@@@The opportunities presented by new technologies are also best harnessed together.@@@The multilateral system remains the best way to respond to the challenges confronting the international community.@@@But that system now finds itself under pressure.@@@As global realities have changed, many have started to question existing structures.@@@As we strive to strengthen multilateral cooperation, all voices must be heard, particularly the critical ones.@@@Instead of rushing to judgment, we need to learn to listen.@@@In my first address here.@@@I spoke of the rapid economic growth in the so-called global South and the tremendous changes it was bringing about.@@@Those changes have been clearly visible for some time now.@@@Asian.@@@African and Latin American countries are powerful geopolitical players.@@@Today’s fastest-growing and most populous economies are to be found in precisely those regions, and that should be reflected in our debates.@@@More than a year and a half ago.@@@Russia launched its large-scale war on Ukraine.@@@Russia’s aggression is a direct violation of the Charter of the United Nations, to which we are all committed.@@@By aiding Ukraine.@@@Finland, together with many other countries, is supporting Ukraine’s inherent right to self-defence.@@@For many Finns.@@@Ukraine’s fight for freedom carries echoes of our own history.@@@We too have fought for our freedom and independence against an enemy far greater in size and paid a high price for it.@@@We do not want to see the world regress to a state where the big consider it their privilege to subjugate the small.@@@While the war is directed against Ukraine, it affects us all in both principle and practice.@@@It has serious consequences globally.@@@The war in Ukraine must not become one of the many protracted conflicts that we are seeing around the world today.@@@Peace that respects Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity is in all of our interests, and it must be the objective.@@@Finland supports Ukraine’s efforts towards a just and lasting peace.@@@But they cannot be Ukraine’s efforts alone.@@@We need as wide an international participation as possible.@@@It is essential that the discussions recently held in Jeddah continue, and the open debate taking place today in the Security Council (see S/PV.9421) is also a very important opportunity to discuss and find avenues forward.@@@Bringing the war to a just end is essential for the Ukrainians, but it may also help to lower tensions on a wider scale.@@@We are witnessing the erosion of the international arms control architecture.@@@Important treaties have been abandoned.@@@What is left seems to be in jeopardy.@@@Rebuilding and strengthening arms control in the current international environment is difficult, but we have to understand that a world without mutually agreed upon rules and transparency is an unpredictable one.@@@Emerging technologies are further complicating the picture.@@@The risks are mounting.@@@We must come together to tackle those issues.@@@Globally people’s sense of security has decreased to an alarming level.@@@There are over 100 armed conflicts ongoing worldwide.@@@People in Afghanistan, the Sudan and Yemen and in many other countries continue to face enormous humanitarian needs.@@@We should not lose sight of any of those emergencies.@@@I commend the Secretary-General for his vision outlined in the New Agenda for Peace.@@@We must prioritize diplomacy and make full use of the United Nations.@@@Finland has long underlined the importance of the universal and binding nature of human rights.@@@Human rights need to be respected even when our societies face turmoil.@@@In difficult times, the rights of women and girls are often eroded.@@@We need to be decisive in safeguarding those rights.@@@As a member of the Human 
Rights Council.@@@Finland works together with all stakeholders to uphold universal human rights.@@@No country is perfect when it comes to human rights; we can learn from each other.@@@When one of us fails, the international community needs to ensure accountability for violations.@@@Earlier this week, we were rightly reminded that the lack of progress on the Sustainable Development Goals has severe implications both for people’s lives and prosperity and for global peace and security.@@@That is a most urgent task: to ensure a sustainable future for all life on this planet, and we are not on track.@@@We need to take our commitments much more seriously.@@@If we fall behind on one goal, the effects are likely to be multiplied in other areas.@@@Climate action is a clear example.@@@Important steps have been taken, but more needs to be done.@@@Any progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals will be undermined if we do not manage to cap global warming at 1.5°C.@@@Climate change and biodiversity loss are challenges that the global community cannot escape.@@@The past summer was yet again the hottest on record.@@@We have seen devastating floods, drought and wildfires in all parts of the world.@@@We must understand that these are existential questions.@@@It is also important to realize that climate change does not treat us equally or fairly.@@@Those least responsible for it are often the ones who suffer the most.@@@We must raise our collective ambition.@@@New, strong commitments to reduce emissions are urgently needed.@@@And those must be backed by swift and effective action.@@@As Secretary-General Guterres yesterday aptly stated, the United Nations was created precisely for moments like this —moments of maximum danger and minimum agreement.@@@During the years that I have been attending the Assembly, we have seen tremendous challenges.@@@We have also seen concrete efforts to make the multilateral system work better in responding to them.@@@Yet we often fail to deliver.@@@We should all look to ourselves to find the root cause of those repeated frustrations.@@@The United Nations is a sum of its members.@@@It is our task to make sure the system rises to the occasion.@@@Mutual understanding and agreement can be increased only through dialogue and a genuine willingness to engage.@@@None of us can afford to dismiss the concerns of the other.@@@None of us has the right to impose our thinking or constructs on others.@@@We, as a global community, have to be prepared to meet each other from a position of mutual respect and with a keen understanding of our common obligation to work together.@@@If we do so.@@@I am convinced that we will find we have much more in common than we had thought.@@@First.@@@I would like to thank all those whose daily work is dedicated to the United Nations and its ideals.@@@All across the globe, people work in the name of the United Nations, wearing the colours and emblems of this Organization, giving their effort in the pursuit of making our world a better place.@@@I thank them.@@@I also thank those who are responsible for keeping the buildings and offices clean and ready for business.@@@I thank those who make sure that technology runs smoothly, the translators and security staff, the diplomats of the Member States and those who are entrusted with making decisions and bearing the responsibility of managing the day- to-day operations of the United Nations.@@@In a large organization, each individual must do their part, and every task — no matter how mundane — is done in the name of our common cause and deserves to be done well.@@@Everyone has a role to play, and all those roles are important.@@@This week has been dominated by discussions of the many and serious problems that humankind faces.@@@Most of these pressing problems do not respect national borders.@@@We are now — more than ever in the history of humankind — in a state of mutual reliance and dependence.@@@The problems created by some of us often have dire consequences for others.@@@A disruption in production in one part of the world has an impact on the well-being of people in another.@@@Hateful rhetoric that is used for political gain in one country can spread with the speed of light across borders and poison public discourse in another.@@@But there are other and more uplifting parts of that reality.@@@Solutions that are discovered in any distant region of the world can be transported and utilized across the globe in an instant.@@@New ideas in culture, in science and in political thought do not respect any national boundaries.@@@Being interconnected also means that people are aware of each other’s humanity.@@@But, sadly, at the same time, when we need it the most, multilateralism is in serious crisis.@@@I believe that we are at a critical juncture and that when we look back at these times 30 years from now, either we will look back with absolute sadness and horror to a catastrophe that could have been avoided, or these times will be considered a moment of strength, when the international system showed that it could withstand its toughest test without breaking apart.@@@We need to take the long view and contemplate how our actions today will look a few decades from now.@@@How leaders act and how institutions respond will determine the difference between hope and despair.@@@That means the United Nations, and that means us, the people who are entrusted with positions of leadership and service.@@@In that regard, we all have a role to play, and each role is important.@@@This year marks the halfway point for the ambitious Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set out in 2015.@@@It is estimated that only 15 per cent of the SDGs are currently on track for completion by 2030.@@@Plainly speaking, it is halftime, and we are down by a big margin.@@@During this week some positive steps 
have been taken at the SDG Summit, but it will be actions, not words, that count.@@@Iceland presented its second voluntary national review in July.@@@As with many others, we have a mixed story to tell.@@@Some of our goals are on track, others are simply not.@@@My Government remains committed to the timely implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@As for most of us, the second half will be decisive.@@@The Paris Agreement is also in jeopardy.@@@Over the past months, we have witnessed the increased intensity of climate change and natural disasters in the form of flooding, drought and extreme weather patterns.@@@Wildfires are battering every corner of the world.@@@Those phenomena have local and global ramifications, including increased food insecurity, poverty and hunger.@@@This is not just a threat to some in distant parts of the world.@@@This is an existential threat to us all.@@@And it is the most vulnerable, especially women and children and poorer communities, who bear the brunt of these events, which are the consequences of problems that they had no part in creating.@@@Where there is hope, it continues to be in cooperation and in a multilateral approach to solving problems.@@@A recent example is the historic agreement reached earlier this year on marine biodiversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction (BBNJ), under the auspices of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea — our constitution of the ocean.@@@The BBNJ agreement is a testament to the importance and effectiveness of multilateralism when it comes to tackling the triple planetary threat of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution.@@@It was an important milestone to which Iceland is proud to have contributed.@@@December marks the seventy-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.@@@It is a milestone worth celebrating.@@@The world has long since learned that when the rights of people are denied in one State, there is a real danger that the effect will be felt by others.@@@Just as domestic violence is a societal problem, not a family matter — brutal treatment of citizens in one State of the United Nations is a matter that concerns us all.@@@Earlier this month.@@@Iceland formally presented its candidature to the Human Rights Council for the term 2025-2027.@@@Human rights are a key pillar of Iceland’s foreign and development policy, based on the conviction that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interrelated, interdependent and mutually reinforcing.@@@Our candidature is endorsed by the Nordic countries.@@@Member States in the Human Rights Council do not have to be perfect.@@@None of us are.@@@We can all do better, and we should all aim to do better.@@@We are seeing a serious degradation of human rights in many Member States.@@@Women and girls in Afghanistan cannot go to school.@@@Their basic freedoms are taken from them, and they live under cruel and violent suppression.@@@I salute the bravery of the women, within Afghanistan and outside, who continue to bring the attention of the world to the horrors perpetrated by the Taliban.@@@In Iran, the authorities continue to deny women freedom and to punish those who dissent.@@@We should all listen to the voices of people who put themselves in danger by openly fighting for human rights.@@@We are seeing degradation in the rights of LGBTI+ communities in many places.@@@Of all the things that people choose to worry about.@@@I simply can never understand why people should not be allowed the freedom to love and be loved for who they are.@@@The shocking treatment of women by many countries, and the blatant inequalities in even more countries, are a terribly sad and unfair situation for the women of those countries because, quite frankly, it simply does not make any sense.@@@I come from a country that is considered to have a very strong record when it comes to gender equality.@@@And Iceland is fortunate enough to be a society that has developed from being among the poorest in Europe to one of the most prosperous since we became an independent republic almost 80 years ago.@@@The fact of our equality and the fact of our prosperity are strongly linked.@@@We do not have gender equality in Iceland because it is a luxury that we can afford.@@@It is gender equality that has made us strong.@@@In Belarus, opponents of the regime are jailed and exiled while the rulers align themselves with Russia’s war in Ukraine.@@@All of those who dedicate themselves to ensuring human rights and freedoms for the people of Belarus deserve to be listened to and supported.@@@And there are so many other places around the world where people are being punished for their opinions and for challenging authorities.@@@Civil society, media and freedom of speech are being undermined, not only in autocratic countries, but all over the world.@@@Cases of people being arbitrarily detained by Governments are on the rise and are deeply troubling.@@@There is a trend in the direction of the deterioration of democratic values and civil rights, often led by populist politicians who offer simplistic solutions to complex problems.@@@They spread suspicion, peddle misinformation and foster polarization in their societies.@@@That poses a dilemma.@@@Those who undermine democratic norms do so under the protection of the same human rights that they are attacking.@@@And while some of these rights are misused, it is also clear that we will need to rely on human- made solutions to our human-made problems.@@@And that will rely on the creative and innovative thinking of individuals who have the freedom to express their thoughts, to challenge the status quo and to test their ideas, services and products in an open and competitive society.@@@Artificial intelligence asks some serious questions that will demand close multilateral cooperation to avoid the very real risk of this technology becoming a tool of destruction rather than creation.@@@We must also bear in mind that the promise of human rights and freedom applies to individuals and does not necessarily extend to State-sponsored propaganda or artificially generated misinformation that is intended to sow discord and disunity.@@@Freedom of expression is for human beings — not for programmed bots that spread hate, lies and fear — because human rights are for human beings.@@@Military coups are proliferating in Africa, the situation in the Sudan is deteriorating, the Taliban regime is tightening its grip in Afghanistan, the military junta in Myanmar continues to commit atrocities, and the conflict between Israel and Palestine is frequently flaring up, with a two-State solution nowhere in sight.@@@Russia’s war of territorial aggression is not only a brutal assault on Ukraine and its people, but also an unprecedented affront to the international system.@@@That madness has been ongoing for over 18 months and is the sole responsibility of a permanent member of the Security Council that should be acting on behalf of the United Nations membership as a guardian of international peace and security.@@@Instead, the Russian Federation chooses to viciously attack a neighbouring country in complete violation of the Charter of the United Nations and international law.@@@Iceland is proud to have been at the helm when the Council of Europe decided last May to establish a register of damage incurred by the Russian invasion in Ukraine.@@@That is an important step in seeking reparations after the war and holding perpetrators to account.@@@Every country of the world, and humankind as a whole, stands to lose if the international community allows wars of neo-colonial conquest by large powers against its neighbours.@@@There are many grey zones in world affairs, but this is not one of them.@@@Russia is the aggressor and must be stopped.@@@Ukraine is rightly defending its land and, by extension, our international system, and Ukraine must be supported.@@@Humankind does not only create problems.@@@We also create solutions, and some of these solutions border on being miraculous.@@@In fact — this very Organization, and the system of international and multilateral cooperation of which it is both the pinnacle and foundation — is an example of a human-made solution to human-made problems.@@@But maintaining relevance and importance throughout many decades is not an easy task.@@@It falls to the Organization itself, but more crucially to its Member States, to avoid the pitfalls that put in jeopardy all organizations as they age.@@@They can take on a life of their own, increasingly independent from their original aims.@@@We will need to be creative, innovative and willing to look critically at how things are done, with the aim of finding ever better ways of serving the States and people of the world.@@@We need reforms to the Security Council that reflect a much changed and evolved world since the institution was set up.@@@And we need more high-level dialogue that is open and unscripted and in which the people responsible for making important decisions can engage with each other and exchange views.@@@Sometimes it is difficult to talk to people that you do not agree with, but I have never found it to be harmful.@@@The people of this Organization, and us — people who hold positions of leadership in Member States — are all human beings who benefit from being in the company of other human beings.@@@The United Nations must be modern and change with the times.@@@This system — a miracle of the human spirit when it was first set up — must earn its legitimacy over and over again, as new generations replace those who hold the memories of why our current world order, with all its flaws, is still vastly and completely superior to any other alternative.@@@We have no alternative but to adapt.@@@We all have a role to play, and each role is important.@@@Failure is not an option.@@@I offer Mr. Dennis Francis my warm congratulations on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session.@@@I pay tribute to his predecessor.@@@Mr. Csaba Korosi, for the work accomplished during his mandate.@@@I express my country’s confidence in Secretary-@@@General Antonio Guterres for the bold and multifaceted action and the important reforms he is undertaking with a view to accelerating the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and to promote international peace and security.@@@I stand before the Assembly in an unprecedented context for my country, which has gone through a fearful time following a chaotic electoral process interrupted on 30 August by the defence and security forces.@@@That intervention was condemned by the international community as a violation of democratic demands for the devolution of power.@@@It will be useful, however, for the sake of providing a balance of information and dispelling certain suspicions, to recall the specific Gabonese political context that preceded and justified the takeover of power.@@@It would be wrong, from our point of view, to condemn without nuance and to make easy assumptions out of tune with the realities of our context.@@@Let me first remind everyone of the experience of the 2016 presidential election, of which the current situation is one consequence.@@@Everyone remembers that the election was the subject of a detailed report from the European Union Election Observation Mission, which denounced the process as fraudulent, insincere and devoid of transparency, with results defying the laws of statistics.@@@It was mainly characterized by violence, with 
the loss of many human lives and significant damage to property for the entire community.@@@In an attempt to defuse the situation, the social cost of which was high, an ersatz dialogue was organized in 2017 that resulted in the return of two rounds of voting.@@@It was that small concession to democracy that was taken up again in the first half of 2023 before it was even tested.@@@That made it clear that the regime did not intend to abandon its fraudulent strategy.@@@From 2017 to 2022, no preparation for the elections, constitutionally scheduled to be held no later than 26 August 2023, was undertaken.@@@The latter began only in February 2023 and uncovered a large number of breaches and distortions made to the constitutional, legislative and regulatory framework of elections, which included — although the electoral process was already launched — this non-exhaustive inventory: a return to single-round elections; the choice of a president of the Gabonese Elections Centre who is notoriously biased, due to his status as a known member of the ruling party; an unreliable electoral register, tainted by the presence of numerous deceased people; the removal of provisions allowing the representation of all candidates in polling stations, in flagrant violation of the principle of equality; the modification, in violation of the simple principle of the hierarchy of norms, of the legislative provisions resulting from the law establishing provisions common to all political elections by decree; and the coupling of candidacies for the presidential and legislative elections.@@@We note that all the referrals made by the various components of the opposition and civil society to contest those modifications were rejected without consideration by a Constitutional Court subservient to power.@@@Any attentive, honest and good-faith observer of Gabonese political life in recent years was fully aware of the deterioration of the situation.@@@Everyone within the Gabonese opposition consulted with the diplomatic missions and then, on 9 August 2023, went environment masse to the Secretary-General’s Special Representative for Central Africa, residing in Libreville, to warn him of the turning point that the electoral process was approaching and of the danger involved in pursuing it in the light of all these observations.@@@Now.@@@I want to say again here without ambiguity that neither the political actors nor the voters were ready to accept a new electoral fraud.@@@That determination, known to all, did not prevent the Gabonese Election Centre from transporting the ballot boxes under its exclusive control and without sealing them, or from proceeding fraudulently with modifications to the minutes at the sites where the results were compiled, as distinct from the sites where the ballots were cast.@@@The acceptance of the results obtained in that way could only lead, the day after their announcement, to clashes.@@@In that context, the defence and security forces were faced with the choice of either preparing to repress the protests, with the risk of sooner or later being prosecuted before international courts because of their responsibility, or to decide to interrupt a process that was fraudulent and dangerous to national cohesion.@@@They responsibly chose the second path to avert the risk of a conflagration whose repercussions would have shaken the very foundations of Gabonese society and would not have spared the numerous foreigners living in Gabon.@@@It would not have been reasonable or responsible to allow such a confusing situation to continue.@@@A descent into a cycle of violence would have constituted an overall disaster.@@@Consequently, the military intervention, which shed no blood and caused no material damage, was a lesser evil.@@@The population approved of it by a very large majority in scenes of spontaneous jubilation that everyone around the world was able to follow thanks to the images that circulated, and the majority of the political class found themselves relieved to have avoided an uncertain outcome.@@@Therefore, to condemn that process is to maintain that it would have been better to let the clashes take place and to count the number of victims later, since no one in the opposition was willing to let that umpteenth electoral theft take place.@@@While such an intervention was necessary, we cannot be satisfied with the status quo.@@@We must immediately and in an inclusive manner prepare reforms and restore the normal institutional order that allows the devolution of power through elections.@@@The road map for the transitional Government that I have been leading for two weeks seeks to restore confidence, make major corrections to the electoral framework, restore institutions and prepare for the implementation of those reforms.@@@Following a national conference, the expected deliverables of that consultation will be the adoption of a new constitution reflecting our social contract, as well as the adoption of legislation including, in particular, an electoral law guaranteeing transparent, free and credible voting.@@@That is why I have already announced a press conference to take place next week, at which I will 
indicate the timetable for consultations among the entire political class and civil society.@@@I will take that opportunity to outline the timeline of the different stages that will lead to new elections.@@@In that perspective, what Gabon needs most is encouragement and support to carry out those projects within deadlines that everyone wants to be reasonable.@@@I therefore take this opportunity to launch a solemn appeal to all of our bilateral, regional and multilateral partners to accompany and support the popular momentum for national salvation with a view to strengthening the foundations of the rule of law and democracy for shared prosperity.@@@In this pivotal phase of our destiny and our history, the Gabonese people, who are united in harmony around the Transitional Committee for the Restoration of Institutions, will remember with gratitude the solidarity and confidence of the peoples of Africa and the whole world who stand by its side to help it preserve its place in the concert of nations.@@@Seventy-eight years after the creation of the United Nations, an endless cycle of crises continues to darken our hopes and prospects for lasting peace among and within nations.@@@Multiple crises of solidarity, security crises, humanitarian crises, health crises, climate crises and geopolitical crises are fuelling feelings of distrust towards international institutions and mechanisms.@@@Indeed, clearly, the system of collective and indivisible security advocated by the Charter of the United Nations is seen as a fiction in many regions of the world that are prey to the upheavals of war, particularly in Africa, where the Sahel region, the Horn of Africa and the Great Lakes region have become veritable epicentres of instability.@@@In most of those regions, the rapine of natural resources constitutes a significant source of conflict, to the point that they have become a true curse for the countries that possess them.@@@Today we find ourselves at an inflection point that requires all members of the international community to reacquaint themselves with the objectives of the Charter of the United Nations and to reconnect to the aspirations of the peoples of the world.@@@It is crucial to reconfigure the social contract among nations, regardless of their size or power, keeping in mind that every people counts.@@@Above all, we must recalibrate the projection of our identity as peoples of the world by consistently giving priority to dialogue over confrontation and to cooperation over the logic of opposing camps.@@@We must without further delay carry out a real structural transformation of the peace and security architecture of our Organization, and adapt our mechanisms for promoting peace and security to a global context of constantly changing crises and conflicts.@@@That is the relevance of the theme of this general debate, focused on the need to rebuild trust and reignite solidarity to accelerate the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@Gabon reaffirms that prevention is a more than essential tool that must be at the centre of our actions if we want strengthened and lasting peace.@@@The international community’s prevention efforts to date have been slow, poorly adapted and poorly funded.@@@Indeed, the absence of adequate resources allocated to the actions of our Organization in favour of prevention and peace-building has, unfortunately, strongly contributed either to the resurgence of crises in periods of transition or to the emergence of new conflicts.@@@Our generation has a responsibility to future generations — that of bequeathing them a more secure world; a world in which the threats to peace and security linked to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction are contained; a world without the nuclear threat.@@@There remains a considerable gap between our actions and our commitments.@@@It is time to fill it, particularly on the crucial issue of financing climate action.@@@Gabon has made several decades of investments in the preservation of biodiversity and demonstrated tireless commitment to the fight against climate change.@@@New debt-for-nature financial pacts offer opportunities to increase budgets dedicated to protecting biodiversity, responding to the unsustainability of the debt of developing countries and combating climate change.@@@Through that new green finance mechanism, my country recently benefited from a 3 per cent restructuring of its debt against a commitment to investing $163 million in the preservation of its marine ecosystems.@@@We must go further in that dynamic.@@@I therefore invite international financial partners to increase debt conversion initiatives to face the challenges of global warming, loss of biodiversity and sustainable development.@@@It is through a multilateral approach and the rethinking of our responses that we can effectively address the multifaceted challenges facing humankind.@@@The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is our common road map to address global challenges.@@@However, with less than 10 years to go, progress is uneven and insufficient.@@@Poverty, hunger, social 
inequalities, deficiencies in health and education and the lack of adequate financing for the objectives of sustainable development are seriously jeopardizing the achievement of that ambitious programme.@@@Throughout the transition that I am leading.@@@I plan to redouble my country’s efforts to accelerate the implementation of the 2030 Agenda by strengthening national policies in a practical and pragmatic manner and encouraging innovative partnerships between the public and private sectors.@@@Furthermore.@@@I intend to place emphasis on action by the authorities, civil society and the private sector at the local level by fully involving citizens, particularly young people and women.@@@It is critical that the international community increase its support for developing countries.@@@Additional financing is indeed necessary, in particular for the most vulnerable countries.@@@The various summits organized on the sidelines of this session, in particular on financing for development, climate ambition and universal coverage, are an opportunity for the international community to concretize its desire for joint action with a view to accelerating the achievement of the SDGs.@@@Within the United Nations system, exclusion and marginalization are fearsome underminers of coexistence.@@@Africa must be able to find its rightful place as a full-fledged player on the international scene and not as a mere geopolitical issue for the Powers.@@@Indeed, more than 78 years after the creation of the United Nations, the world has completely changed.@@@The international context has completely changed.@@@The geopolitical landscape has completely changed.@@@The nature of wars has literally been transformed.@@@Technology has completely transformed our daily lives.@@@But the structure of our institutions remains essentially unchanged, particularly with regard to our collective security.@@@To meet the challenges of the future, our security architecture should reflect current and future realities.@@@We must update our international institutions, our mentalities and our perceptions of lasting peace, shared prosperity and coexistence.@@@We must reinvent solutions to contemporary threats, including climate change and cyberspace insecurity.@@@We must confront the crisis of international solidarity that is fuelling the underlying economic, humanitarian, health and food crises.@@@We cannot meet those challenges of this century with the tools of a bygone century.@@@In the light of that distressing observation, we are convinced of the urgency of action to give effect to three fundamental approaches capable of making the multilateral system more credible and more inclusive.@@@First, we must reform the Security Council without further delay.@@@It must be representative of today’s realities and of current and future challenges.@@@Secondly, we must redefine our rules and mechanisms to adequately address the evolution of insecurity and terrorism.@@@We must guarantee inclusiveness and solidarity so as to leave no room for double standards.@@@We also need to tackle the root causes of conflicts and crises with greater rigour.@@@Thirdly, we must build a new social contract — a new global pact between generations, between those who govern and those who are governed, and between the global and regional spheres, with particular emphasis on young people, women, civil society and the private sector.@@@In that new social contract for the future, bridges must replace walls everywhere.@@@Education must everywhere break the shackles of ignorance and intolerance.@@@Multilateralism must prevail over unilateralist postures, and the logic of dialogue must constantly prevail over the logic of antagonism and zones of influence.@@@To conclude.@@@I would like to emphasize our need to respond to present and future generations.@@@That intergenerational solidarity is a moral demand on behalf of those who will have no other choice but to inherit the consequences of our choices today.@@@We owe them a response that is commensurate with their fears, their needs and their legitimate aspirations to live in peace, dignity and prosperity.@@@It is with regard to those existential perspectives that we have shouldered our responsibilities and that we are resolutely committed to aligning our action with the expectations of our people.@@@It is an honour for me to speak before the General Assembly on behalf of France.@@@I do so knowing how important our common Assembly is, this Assembly of all our nations, which have decided to freely unite their destinies and act for the common good.@@@It is in that spirit that I speak before Member States — the spirit of those who, nearly eight decades ago, wanted from the rubble of the world to usher in a new era in relations among States; an era in which everyone understands that defending their own interests requires respect for common principles; and an era in which everyone understands that today’s strong can be tomorrow’s weak, where yesterday’s enemies can be today’s friends.@@@That is the path that France and Germany have taken.@@@It is an era in which power is framed by law, an era in which the common challenges of humankind are finally tackled together, rather than every man for himself.@@@That is what we have learned to do by overcoming in Europe centuries of conflict through cooperation and trust.@@@It is that quest for the common good, that spirit of the United Nations, that drives France’s international action.@@@It is the spirit of a Power confident in its principles, united and always ready to act collectively for the common good.@@@What are our principles?@@@They are those that this Assembly reaffirmed by overwhelming majorities when it condemned Russian aggression against Ukraine 
on three previous occasions.@@@Nothing, neither morally nor legally, can ever justify invading one’s neighbour, attempting annexations through unworthy manoeuvres and martyring the population.@@@France defends the simple principles of equality among States and respect for their territorial integrity and sovereignty, principles with which no one can compromise.@@@France also defends the principle of food security.@@@Despite the confusion and propaganda that some people spread at every turn, who can believe that someone who destroys cereals and grain silos has the slightest interest in global food security, when, in fact, they are its enemy?@@@What we are seeing is the expression of pure brutality, capable of using any weapon, and even hunger, in an attempt to revive an imperialist dream.@@@In that context, other countries, like France, are taking tangible action by financing the deliveries of the World Food Programme to the most fragile States, facilitating the export of Ukrainian grain through the European Union’s solidarity lanes and funding ambitious programmes around the world to develop local agriculture and to support school canteens.@@@France also defends the principle of the inviolability of nations’ historic heritage — the legacy of humankind’s cultures.@@@In Mosul and Timbuktu yesterday, in Odesa and Lviv today, everywhere.@@@France supports the efforts of those that defend the historic treasures that hatred threatens to destroy.
Lastly.@@@France clearly supports the principle of combating impunity.@@@Our support for the International Criminal Court can be seen everywhere — in the Sahel in order to try jihadists whom France pushed back yesterday and who again threaten a whole region; and, of course, in Ukraine, where war crimes and crimes against humanity are committed daily against the population.@@@What is happening in Ukraine concerns us all.@@@If we allow our common principles to be transgressed there, they will be transgressed everywhere.@@@If we allow an aggression to be rewarded, there will be more aggressions, there or elsewhere.@@@Russia’s war of aggression is also a blow to the most vulnerable countries.@@@It means that we all have a duty of solidarity today.@@@In 2022.@@@France became the fourth actor in that solidarity by joining three friendly Powers — the United States.@@@Japan and Germany.@@@That is the result of a patient investment that I am proud to present.@@@France stands in solidarity with those threatened by hunger.@@@The appeal made a few days ago to preserve agricultural infrastructure; the massive increase in our food aid to almost €1 billion now, which benefits 67 countries, including this week Nigeria and the Sudan; the hosting of the upcoming meeting of the School Meals Coalition in Paris on 18 and 19 October; and the replenishment consultation of the International Fund for Agricultural Development in December, which aims to bring about a replenishment of $2 billion, are all illustrations of that solidarity.@@@Our cooperation efforts also seek to enable access for all to the funding needed to fight poverty and to bring about energy transitions, in line with the ambitious United Nations agenda to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@The French President therefore took the initiative of organizing the Summit for a New Global Financing Pact in Paris on 22 and 23 June, which charted a course to increase public and private funding to address the challenge of international cooperation.@@@The Summit produced immediate positive results, such as the signing of a Just Energy Transition Partnership in Senegal and the agreement reached on Zambia’s debt.@@@Commitments that France has been working for years to fulfil have also been met, such as the reallocation of $100 billion special drawing rights.@@@The Paris Agenda for Peoples and the Planet, which emerged from the June Summit, sets out clear principles to address both the challenges of poverty and of climate change and biodiversity loss so as to ensure that no country need choose between those goals.@@@I call on all States that have not yet done so to endorse the Paris Agenda.@@@Our cooperation effort is also that of a country that has surpassed its climate financing promises by more than €1 billion, bringing it now to €7.6 billion as of 2022.@@@It is that of a country that will continue to work tirelessly to protect the planet’s lungs.@@@In June 2025.@@@France will therefore host the United Nations Ocean Conference, which it is co-organizing with Costa Rica, in order to strengthen as far as possible the protection of an essential carbon sink — the oceans.@@@I am counting on the support and the commitment of Member States to protecting forests and building partnerships for their conservation.@@@Our cooperation effort is that of a country that will always be committed to the promotion and defence of human rights.@@@We will celebrate the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Paris and Geneva this December.@@@It will be an opportunity to pay tribute to those who fight to defend rights and freedoms and to safeguard human dignity.@@@Those are rights to which we all aspire across the globe.@@@I am thinking of women’s rights, particularly in Afghanistan, where women are repressed for being who they are by a Taliban regime that has tragically made a policy of segregation and violence against women a central tenet of its political identity.@@@Our solidarity is also with those who fight for others, sometimes risking their lives.@@@I am thinking of the United Nations peacekeepers, as well as the 116 humanitarian workers who were killed and those who were injured or kidnapped in 2022.@@@We must protect them better, and France will remain fully engaged at their side, as we did this week with our humanitarian partners here at the United Nations.@@@Based on those principles.@@@France will always be ready to carry out collective action to serve the common good.@@@In terms of the climate, today we can see how a lack of ambition can result in disasters.@@@Extreme weather events, fires and flooding have marked this year, all around the world, and resulted in tens of thousands of victims.@@@The latest report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the summary produced ahead of the twenty-eighth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change should alarm us.@@@We cannot look away.@@@On the contrary, we must take action fast and collectively to tackle those common challenges, which no nation on this planet can escape.@@@It is urgent, but possible.@@@To do that, we have a tested method, which helped us to achieve results in the past.@@@It is that of the Montreal Protocol, which enabled humankind to resolve the ozone layer problem.@@@It is the method that we used to together reach the Paris Agreement on Climate Change in 2015.@@@It is also that method that should enable the international legally binding instrument on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity beyond areas of national jurisdiction to enter into force as soon as possible to protect marine areas; and it is the method that will help us to fulfil the ambitious aims of the Kunming-Montreal agreement on biodiversity and adopt — we hope, as it is necessary — a legally binding agreement to eliminate plastic pollution.@@@That method, which is the only viable way to go beyond awareness-raising and act with determination, commitment and responsibility, is multilateralism.@@@Given the climate destruction, the demolition of our natural environment and the widespread loss of our biodiversity.@@@Member States can count on France to continue to take the initiative.@@@The multilateral method is also the one that enables us to resolve the increasing number of international crises.@@@In Nagorno-Karabakh, the international community must ensure that a population subjected to nine months of a relentless blockade and a recent campaign of bombing and destruction, at last has its rights and security guaranteed.@@@A diktat imposed on a besieged civilian population cannot be a solution, while the threats made against Armenia itself and the attacks against its territory that have already been observed must cease.@@@In Africa, we believe in African solutions to African crises, and we support the African regional organizations whenever they ask for support from their partners.@@@We are doing that in the Niger, where France supports the Economic Community of West African States in its efforts to restore constitutional order, undermined by force as the democratically elected President Mohamed Bazoum faces an attempted coup d’etat.@@@In the Sudan, a murderous war has been raging for more than five months.@@@Civilians are the primary victims of an atrocious conflict.@@@It is therefore the international community’s duty to continue to work tirelessly to find solutions to achieve peace.@@@We once again ask the warring parties to cease the fighting and spare civilians, allow a humanitarian truce and bring about an inclusive political solution.@@@Neither can we become accustomed to the conflict in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which has for so long been driven by the same motivations and hurt the same people.@@@There, too.@@@France is providing support to regional conflict resolution mechanisms to facilitate a negotiated, peaceful solution.@@@France is, and will remain, a reliable, consistent ally to African regional organizations in their fight for peace, development, democracy and the security of the continent.@@@In a changing Middle East.@@@France is also playing its part, tirelessly supporting dialogue and cooperation.@@@We will continue to participate, at the invitation of our Iraqi partner, in the so-called Baghdad process, an unprecedented format of dialogue among all countries of the region, which will soon meet again to work this time on tangible projects to respond to the clear need for cooperation among such countries.@@@Between Israelis and Palestinians, we will also continue our efforts for peace that guarantees both peoples a State and secure and recognized borders based on the 1967 lines, with Jerusalem as the capital.@@@The two-State solution is the only path to just and lasting peace.@@@In a changing environment, the United Nations must also adapt.@@@France supports the Secretary-General’s ambitious reform agenda and actively contributes to the preparations ahead of the 2024 Summit of the Future.@@@We must also regain the momentum for Security Council reform.@@@I am of course thinking of the expansion of the Council, in which we have long supported greater African representation, including among the permanent members, and the candidacy for the Group of Four.@@@I am also thinking of the framework for the right to veto in the event of mass atrocities, which paves the way for the renewed effectiveness of the Security Council.@@@True to its tradition.@@@France will be present so that we, together, as our United Nations, can tackle global challenges, threats to international peace and security and attacks on our shared principles.@@@To do that, the Secretary-General.@@@Antonio Guterres, can count on the unwavering support of France.@@@Now is the time to act, together, for the good of all.@@@I greet the President of the General Assembly, as well as the Secretary-General, the Heads of State and Government, the official delegations and the Organization, which has worked hard to convene this meeting today.@@@Today once again.@@@I come to speak on behalf of my country.@@@I come to speak on behalf of my compatriots.@@@We come here to this forum where representatives from more than 190 countries come to share their messages.@@@We have different cultures and Governments with different ideologies and different social, economic, climatic and geographical situations.@@@But if we are all here, that means that in some way we agreed, a long time ago, to be guided and protected by the same rights, obligations and principles under international law, with scant coercive power and where the same yardstick is often not applied to the great Powers than to smaller countries.@@@We come once again to the Assembly with a positive and optimistic vision of humankind, but we must not be naive.@@@Objectively, we live in a better world, although of course our current reality has its challenges and threats.@@@We are convinced that globalization, information technology, artificial intelligence and real-time communication are tools that help the integration and development of our peoples — of course, if they are used well.@@@In that respect, there is a growing sense of responsibility among world leaders.@@@I heard the Secretary-General emphasize that issue earlier today.@@@We are in a world where speeches are actions; where, standing here, a world leader can generate consequences — be it an international conflict, a bank run or something else —just with his words.@@@Uruguay comes to the Assembly enjoying a full and stable democracy and in full respect for its institutions and the law, which is a historical tradition in our country.@@@Despite the pandemic, despite the Russian invasion, despite different climatic factors, our country has restored its economy to what it was before the pandemic.@@@Employment has improved and unemployment has decreased.@@@We have made a historic public investment in infrastructure.@@@We have received significant foreign direct investment and a large part of those revenues have been reinvested in our country, which signals an important sense of confidence.@@@Public finances are in order.@@@Inflation is at its lowest in the past 18 years.@@@We have been able to lower taxes and, at the same time, we have carried out reforms that have long been urgent, such as educational and social security reform.@@@Uruguayans practice a very precious and responsible freedom.@@@Earlier today, when I was writing part of my speech.@@@I remembered what I said here in September 2021.@@@Towards the end of my speech.@@@I said that “[i] f there is a lesson to be drawn from the pandemic, it is that we are all one” (A/76/PV6, p.20).@@@For the very reason that we are truly all one, today I wish to refer to responsible international freedom.@@@It is clear that our well-being as independent countries is inextricably linked to the common good.@@@Everyone must know that, accept it and, of course, act accordingly.@@@Many Heads of State have long raised the issue of the environment in this forum.@@@I belong to a country that began calling itself “natural Uruguay” many years ago.@@@Among other things, renewable energy in our country exceeds 90 per cent today.@@@We have engaged in significant reforestation.@@@We have sustainable production processes, and I could go on adding to a long list that affirms the concept of natural Uruguay.@@@After many years of declarations and commitments, the international community has truly come to understand that the economy and the environment are closely associated.@@@A few months ago.@@@Uruguay issued a sustainable bond based on rewards and punishments that depend on compliance with parameters established in the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.@@@I want to draw attention here today to the fact that we are convinced that this very system of rewards and punishments should apply to international loans, market access, quotas and tariffs, with the aim not only of punishing non-compliance, but also of rewarding those who have processes that are environmentally friendly and sustainable.@@@In that way, as happens to us when we are children, the stimuli to improve will surely push nations to make a greater effort that will pay off in domestic economies and, obviously, at the global level.@@@In that regard.@@@I want to share a situation that our country is going through and that.@@@I am sure, some of the nations represented here are also experiencing.@@@We could call it the sin of doing things well.@@@What do I mean by the sin of doing things well?@@@Our country has achieved important human and economic development, and because we have obtained those standards we are often denied access to certain cooperation and preference systems and certain very important instruments of international commercial relations.@@@Obviously.@@@I do not want to stop sharing in the spirit with which those mechanisms were created, but I believe that we must redesign them, because in some way they do not stimulate countries to grow and sustain themselves if they lose access to those conditions.@@@I want to make it clear that Uruguay is not here to beg or make exaggerated claims, but simply, as I said earlier, in appealing for international responsible freedom, we want to act with justice.@@@If we do things well, the international cooperation should act accordingly.@@@That means nothing less and nothing more than improving access to opportunity.@@@I shall close here, because members have had a long day.@@@I want once again here, as I have done in other forums, to firmly condemn the Russian invasion of Ukraine and stand in solidarity with the Ukrainian people.@@@I also concur with the Secretary-General in raising my voice against authoritarian populism that impoverishes its people and violates human rights, and thus condemns current and future generations.@@@Once again, perhaps in this area we will have to say a mea culpa, because the absence of a forceful and effective reaction from the international community has often exacerbated or failed to prevent such situations.@@@It is a pleasure and an honour for me to take the floor today, on the anniversary of my country’s accession to the United Nations, to share Chad’s perspectives with the 
United Nations General Assembly — the forum par excellence in which the challenges of our common future are discussed.@@@Before going any further, allow me to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Dennis Francis.@@@Permanent Representative of Trinidad and Tobago, on his election as President of the General Assembly at its present session and to wish him every success in his mission, during which we guarantee him our full support.@@@I would also like to congratulate and thank His Excellency Mr. Csaba Korosi, outgoing President of the Assembly, following his brilliant term of office.@@@It would be remiss of me not to pay well- deserved tribute to Mr. Antonio Guterres.@@@United Nations Secretary-General, for his commitment and able leadership in guiding the destiny of our Organization, which is facing ever greater and more complex challenges.@@@Our common dream of building a stable and peaceful world in which current and future generations can flourish has crumbling over the years.@@@The better and more fulfilled life that we have all hoped for is increasingly giving way to anxiety and uncertainty.@@@Armed conflict, terrorism, climate change, large-scale migration, underdevelopment, poverty and political, economic and financial crises are taking on unprecedented proportions.@@@Every day, we witness atrocities and traumatic scenes that shock our human sensibilities.@@@Thousands of refugees and displaced people, fleeing conflicts or natural disasters, must brave the cold or heat with slim hope of finding a safe haven.@@@At this moment, the people of Chad send their thoughts and prayers to their brothers and sisters in Morocco and Libya, victims of the latest tragedies.@@@They offer their deepest condolences.@@@That is why we welcome the relevance of the theme of the seventy-eighth regular session of the General Assembly, namely.@@@“Rebuilding trust and reigniting global solidarity: accelerating action on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals towards peace, prosperity, progress and sustainability for all”.@@@Yes, that principal theme is highly expressive.@@@The words chosen are symbolic as well as significant.@@@Yes, it is time to rebuild trust and reignite solidarity, because the United Nations is increasingly showing its limits when it comes to embodying those strong values that nonetheless constitute its very essence.@@@Yes, trust is urgently needed in our world, as our world has lost its bearings and its benchmarks, in particular due to the practice of double standards.@@@Yes, solidarity is a top priority, as such a dear and precious value for humankind has been greatly eroded.@@@It is more necessary today than yesterday that nations combine their strengths and pool their energies to accelerate the implementation of projects and programmes linked to the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@Peace, prosperity, progress and sustainability for all require solid investments from all of our nations, particularly those that are most developed.@@@That course of action, which is highly recommended, should be followed without exclusion or prejudice, so that such sought-after trust becomes a tangible reality.@@@Allow me now to briefly share how the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is materializing in my country.@@@Chad.@@@Indeed, since the 2030 Agenda was adopted in September 2015 (resolution 70/1), the Government of Chad has committed to operationalizing its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).@@@That commitment is reinforced by the relevance of the SDGs in view of the context and development challenges Chad faces, particularly in target areas such as the development of human capital, the reduction of poverty and the improvement of the population’s living conditions, the sustainable management of the environment and the consolidation of peace and stability.@@@With that in mind, the Government includes the SDGs among its long-term priorities in its Vision 2030:@@@The Chad We Want and in its national development plan for the period 2017-2021, which has been extended until December 2023, as well as the new national development plan to be adopted for the 2024-2028 period.@@@The implementation of the SDGs in Chad is unfortunately taking place against a backdrop marked by, among other things, a fall in the prices of raw materials on the world markets; repeated attacks by the Boko Haram sect; the health crisis due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic; climate change; and inter-communal conflicts in neighbouring countries with a direct impact on our population; and the political and military conflict.@@@The situation has now been worsened by the ongoing war in the neighbouring Sudan.@@@To date, we have counted more than 400.000 new refugees in addition to the 600.000 refugees who had already 
been settled in Chad for several years.@@@In addition, refugees are coming to Chad from our immediate neighbourhood and elsewhere.@@@Therefore, out of a total population of 17 million Chadians, nearly 2 million are refugees.@@@That is a very heavy burden for Chad to bear.@@@My country calls for rapid, concerted and global action by the entire international community to confront that humanitarian catastrophe, which is likely the worst occurring in our world.@@@Furthermore.@@@Chad welcomes the organization of two summits on the sidelines of the General Assembly: one on climate change; the other on universal health coverage.@@@On climate change.@@@Chad, like other United Nations Member States, hopes that the dynamic initiated by the Secretary-General on the need for global action against climate change will enable the mobilization of the necessary resources for the implementation of the Paris Agreement and the resulting directives.@@@With regard to universal health coverage, to which many of our countries have been committed for a long time, it ultimately remains the most appropriate solution to meet the needs of quality health care that is accessible by all at a lower cost, as well as to strengthen our health systems already weakened by the COVID-19 pandemic.@@@The Chadian Government is giving the matter the attention it requires.@@@As members know, since the sudden and tragic death of President Idriss Deby Itno — may he rest in peace — Chad has been engaged in an inclusive and transparent political transition process.@@@The first milestones of the transition were the conclusion of the Doha agreement between the Government and the political and military movements in the country in August 2022.@@@That agreement allowed many exiled or refugee Chadians to return to the country.@@@The manifest political will to give our country a new start and enable its re-foundation resulted in the holding of an inclusive and sovereign national dialogue, which brought together the overwhelming majority of the nation’s active forces for 45 days.@@@Today the Government of National Unity that emerged from those meetings is working hard to hold a constitutional referendum, which will determine the form of the State.@@@The adoption of the new basic law by the sovereign people will pave the way for the gradual restoration of constitutional order by the deadline set by the inclusive and sovereign national dialogue.@@@At the instigation of the Head of State.@@@President of the transition, bold administrative, judicial, security and military reforms have been implemented; others are under way.@@@In the meantime, strong gestures of appeasement, ranging from the opening up of the political space to the presidential pardon, have helped to ease the climate within the political class.@@@That dynamic of participatory dialogue has also led to the establishment of a framework for consultation among diverse political parties.@@@With regard to the crisis in the Sudan.@@@Chad reiterates its call for a lasting ceasefire.@@@Chad believes that there is no military solution to the crisis taking place in that brotherly neighbouring country.@@@Chad calls on all Sudanese to launch an inclusive national political dialogue.@@@Two days ago, more precisely on 19 September, at the opening of the General Assembly.@@@Secretary-@@@General Antonio Guterres questioned the global governance symbolized by the Security Council and the Bretton Woods system in strong terms:
“the alternative to reform is not the status quo, but further fragmentation.@@@It is reform or rupture.”@@@(A/78/PV.4, p. 2)
Who can say more given the current upsurge in geopolitical rivalries, with the risk of a new Cold War damaging world peace at a time when multilateralism is facing a serious crisis.@@@Given that harsh reality.@@@Chad endorses the call for reform of the Security Council, as reflected in the Common African Position, set out in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration.@@@Finally, in the name of the founding principles of the United Nations.@@@Chad supports the approach of a solution based on the establishment of an independent and sovereign Palestinian State, living in security alongside the State of Israel.@@@Likewise, in the name of the same principle.@@@Chad reiterates its call for the lifting of the embargo imposed on Cuba, which is detrimental to the Cuban people.@@@At the outset.@@@I would like to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Dennis Francis on his election to preside over the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session and to wish him every success in his work.@@@I would also like to thank His Excellency Mr. Csaba Korosi for his outstanding efforts as President of the preceding session.@@@And I want to take this opportunity to commend the efforts of the Secretary-General to enhance the competencies of United Nations entities with a view to realizing the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.@@@The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia stresses the need for States to uphold the Charter, the principles of international legitimacy and our aspirations for a better future for humankind on a basis of mutual respect for the sovereignty, independence and values of States, non-interference in their internal affairs, the peaceful settlement of disputes and refraining from the use or threat of use of force.@@@The Kingdom’s Vision 2030 is aimed at strengthening development efforts, meeting the aspirations of our future generations, contributing to the empowerment of women and young people, building capacities for creativity and innovation and consolidating the values of openness, dialogue, tolerance and coexistence.@@@Saudi Arabia considers human rights issues enormously important, and our legal system includes explicit provisions that promote and protect human rights.@@@Through a development-driven approach, we are working to foster a comprehensive and sustainable renaissance for our country that is centred on and aimed at the human beings who will guide development in the present and create development in the future with knowledge.@@@The Kingdom has enacted numerous laws and amendments to rules and regulations in that regard and has provided capabilities that enhance the dignity of our citizens and residents by doing everything possible to preserve their lives, guarantee decent livelihoods and grant them social protection and care.@@@The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia stresses that security in the Middle East is in need of a just and comprehensive solution to the question of Palestine as soon as possible, one that is based on internationally recognized resolutions and the Arab Peace Initiative and thereby guarantees the Palestinian people’s right to establish their own independent State within the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital.@@@As always, we reject and condemn all unilateral steps taken in flagrant violation of international law, as they undermine regional and international efforts to achieve peace and obstruct the path to a political solution.@@@The Kingdom is committed to supporting all efforts aimed at promoting security and stability, with a focus on comprehensive development, making room for peaceful dialogue and alleviating tensions.@@@We urge the States in our region to avoid escalation and instead to focus on mutual interests and benefits, with a view to realizing the hopes and aspirations of the peoples of the region.@@@In our efforts to build a better future for the region and the world, we have worked to reinforce the principle of collective action by hosting several regional joint summits under the framework of the Gulf Cooperation Council and the League of Arab States, with the participation of all States, including the Syrian Arab Republic, out of a belief that resolving the crisis in Syria will contribute to regional and global stability.@@@As part of those efforts to achieve regional stability, the Kingdom held rounds of talks with the Islamic Republic of Iran, hosted by Baghdad and Muscat.@@@That led to the conclusion of the Beijing Agreement, which inaugurated a resumption of diplomatic representation and direct communication between the two countries, based on mutual respect for the sovereignty, independence and security of States, non-interference in their internal affairs and respect for the Charter of the United Nations and that of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation.@@@The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is committed to the security and stability of its sister country of Yemen.@@@We support all efforts aimed at resolving the crisis there, alleviating the human suffering of our brother people of Yemen, reaching a political solution that restores security and stability in the country and reduces potential threats to the Kingdom and the region.@@@We want to emphasize our initiative aimed at ending the war in Yemen and reaching a comprehensive political solution, and we support United Nations and international efforts to reach a political settlement, in accordance with the three terms of reference, including Security Council resolution 2216 (2015).@@@With regard to Lebanon, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia continues to stand with its brother Lebanese people and calls on all the parties involved to carry out comprehensive, structural political and economic reforms that will enable Lebanon to overcome its current crisis.@@@We also stress that the State should work to extend its authority over the entire Lebanese territories, in accordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions and the Taif Accords, with a view to re-establishing security and combating drug smuggling operations and terrorist activities that endanger regional and international security.@@@With regard to the situation in Iraq, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia considers the security and stability of Iraq to be crucial to security and stability in the region generally.@@@The Kingdom reiterates its support for the security, development, territorial integrity.@@@Arab identity and social fabric of Iraq.@@@Turning to the situation in the Sudan, we are alarmed by the escalation and military clashes in the country between the Sudanese armed forces and the Rapid Support Forces, and we support all efforts to de-escalate the situation and prevent the crisis from deteriorating further.@@@We have taken the initiative to host talks between the parties to the conflict and we are working with the United States of America to protect civilians and deliver assistance to the people affected.@@@We have been working on humanitarian efforts since the crisis began, including by carrying out a rescue operation at sea that saved thousands of Saudi Arabian citizens, nationals of fraternal and friendly countries and staff of the United Nations and other international organizations who had been stranded in the Sudan.@@@His Majesty King Salmanbin Abdulaziz Al-Saudhas launched a popular fundraising campaign for our brother people of the Sudan and has allocated $100 million in relief and humanitarian assistance to address the crisis through the King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Centre, in addition to facilitating sea and air bridges to deliver food, health-care and relief supplies and other essential needs.@@@As part of those efforts, along with our international partners we hosted a high-level donor conference for the Sudan in June at which donors pledged to address the humanitarian crisis, mobilize international humanitarian support and provide more than $1.5 billion in assistance.@@@The Kingdom is eagerly anticipating seeing those efforts succeed and hoping for the Sudan to reach safe harbour and emerge from the crisis.@@@The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia stresses that it is vital to achieve security and stability in Libya, safeguard the country’s sovereignty, independence and territorial unity and put an end to interference in its internal affairs.@@@We support a full ceasefire in Libya and Libya’s call for a full and immediate withdrawal of all foreign forces, fighters and mercenaries from the country in accordance with Security Council resolution 2570 (2021).@@@We also reaffirm the importance of security and stability in Afghanistan, which must not be a safe haven for terrorist organizations.@@@We call for respect for the fundamental rights of the Afghan people, including the right of Afghan women to education and employment, and for regional and international efforts to be stepped up in order to provide humanitarian and economic assistance to alleviate the suffering of our brother people of Afghanistan.@@@With regard to the situation of Russia and Ukraine, the Kingdom reiterates its call for putting an end to the crisis and reducing its negative impact on global security and stability.@@@We should spare no effort in working to end the crisis and find a peaceful solution, while respecting the principles of international law so as to safeguard the security and interests of all.@@@As an extension of our humanitarian efforts.@@@His Royal Highness the Crown Prince and Prime Minister has taken initiatives aimed at resolving the crisis and has continued to work with the States concerned in support of international efforts to establish peace, while using his good offices to facilitate the release of prisoners of various nationalities.@@@In addition.@@@Ukraine was invited to attend the thirty-second session of the League of Arab States Summit held in Jeddah.@@@In August, the Kingdom hosted a meeting of national security advisers on the crisis in Ukraine, bringing together representatives from more than 40 States and international organizations.@@@We emphasize our willingness to continue mediation efforts between the two parties.@@@The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia stresses the importance of efforts aimed at the ultimate elimination of nuclear weapons.@@@It is incumbent on the entire international community to honour its commitments to the existing treaties and legal frameworks in order to achieve a world free of nuclear weapons, especially in the Middle East.@@@We reaffirm the importance of maintaining international peace and security and remain ready to deploy our good offices to resolve international and regional conflicts in accordance with the relevant international principles and norms.@@@In that regard, my country stresses that the only way to establish security and stability in any region of the world is through cooperation and coordination among States aimed at realizing development and progress, and by avoiding races to acquire weapons whose destructiveness is a threat to humankind.@@@The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia remains committed to achieving the purposes and principles of the United Nations for maintaining international peace and security.@@@We reiterate our call for reforming the Security Council so that it can play a fairer and more representative role in our world today, and so that we can make it more effective in keeping up with the constant changes and developments in the international community and more efficient in addressing our common challenges.@@@Our international community has made great strides in the fight against terrorism and extremism.@@@We must continue to work tirelessly to counter and eliminate that scourge, which is not linked to any race, religion or belief.@@@The world must show steadfastness and determination in the face of those who support or sponsor terrorism and extremism.@@@We must reject all forms of aggression against sacred values, including the propagation of hatred and Islamophobia under any pretext, as well as recurring incidents such as burnings of the Qur’an.@@@Such grave acts jeopardize mutual respect and harmony among peoples and hinder international efforts to spread the values of tolerance and moderation as well as the rejection of extremism.@@@We advocate an approach aimed at consolidating a culture of peace worldwide.@@@My country welcomed the resolution adopted at the eighteenth extraordinary session of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation on repeated incidents of desecration and burning of the Holy Qur’an.@@@We also commend the Human Rights Council’s adoption of its resolution 53/1, entitled “Countering religious hatred constituting incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence”.@@@We call for the promotion of dialogue, understanding and cooperation among cultures and civilizations with a view to realizing peace and harmony in the world while complying with relevant international human rights instruments and laws.@@@The stability of global energy markets is a cornerstone of global economic growth.@@@Saudi Arabia is firmly committed to preserving the stability, reliability, sustainability and security of global crude-oil markets, as well as to meeting the needs of consumers to ensure a healthy and beneficial economy for producers and consumers worldwide.@@@We continue to emphasize the importance of collective cooperation with the Organization of Petroleum-Exporting Countries Plus (OPEC+) in order to promote the stability, reliability, sustainability and security of global crude-oil markets.@@@The policies adopted by OPEC+ have made it possible to closely monitor the markets through a preventive approach, thereby contributing to their stability and 
balance, which was clearly illustrated by the stability shown by the oil markets in 2022 compared to other energy markets such as natural gas and coal.@@@Conscious of the importance of addressing the challenges posed by climate change.@@@Saudi Arabia has a major interest in reducing emissions and developing adaptation measures.@@@In that regard, we support the calls for a gradual and responsible transition to low-emission clean-energy systems, using all available energy sources to ensure sustainability.@@@We must continue international cooperation and concerted efforts to reach those goals, taking into account variations in national and regional circumstances, along with the inclusive socioeconomic goals of sustainable development.@@@Given the scale of that challenge.@@@Saudi Arabia seeks to establish its global leadership role in the field of sustainability.@@@We have launched the Saudi Green Initiative and the Middle East Green Initiative aimed at leading the global efforts to protect our environment, reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and promote public health and quality of life.@@@We are working to increase the use of renewable energy and to reduce or even eliminate emissions and achieve sustainable development.@@@The Kingdom has announced that it will double its contribution to reducing emissions compared to 2015 — to the tune of 278 million tons per year by 2030 — in order to achieve carbon neutrality, as per the circular carbon economy approach.@@@We are also working to promote international efforts to ensure water resources worldwide.@@@The Prime Minister recently announced a proposal for establishing a global water organization with a view to developing and integrating the efforts of States and organizations to ensure sustainable water resources accessible to all, and thereby helping to address water challenges in a comprehensive manner.@@@Based on our ambitious vision for the future.@@@Saudi Arabia has applied to host World Expo 2030 under the theme “The era of change: Together for a fore sighted tomorrow”.@@@We intend to apply the Expo’s theme to the future of the planet, basing our efforts on cutting- edge technologies while focusing on the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@The Expo will be an opportunity for promoting projects with universal impact and for cooperation aimed at finding global solutions through innovation, sustainability and inclusiveness.@@@All of those factors will be at the core of the World Expo 2030 in Riyadh and will demonstrate to the world the Kingdom’s firm and continued commitment to developing countries.@@@We would like to express our thanks and appreciation to the States that have supported our candidacy and ask all others to support us in hosting World Expo 2030.@@@In conclusion, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia would like to convey to the world its message, values and principles in a spirit of partnership and respect, with the aim of laying the foundations of a better future for all humankind.@@@Antigua and Barbuda congratulates Mr. Dennis Francis of Trinidad and Tobago on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session.@@@We are very proud of the contribution that the countries of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) are making to advance internationalism in the United Nations and in other multilateral bodies.@@@In that connection, we regard, as a further acknowledgement of CARICOM’s capacity, the election of Guyana to the Security Council from 2024 to 2026.@@@Of course.@@@Guyana’s further service on the Council follows two years of active participation by yet another CARICOM State.@@@Saint Vincent and the Grenadines — the smallest nation in the world to serve on the Security Council.@@@What those accomplishments demonstrate is that smallness is not an impediment to making significant contributions to international decision-making.@@@Consequently, we expect that the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) will be given a seat at the table in significant forums, including Group of 20 meetings, even as an observer.@@@The world is failing developing countries.@@@Those are not my words, but I certainly adopt them.@@@They are the words of Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, spoken less than a week ago.@@@Developing States, against many odds, have remarkably lifted hundreds of millions from the depths of poverty.@@@They have been active participants in the United Nations, fervently searching for and offering global solutions, yet despite those strides, they find themselves ensnared in a myriad of global crises that they had no hand in creating.@@@We are caught in a vortex of skyrocketing prices, overwhelming debts and the undeniable and increasing frequency of climate disasters.@@@The current global frameworks, shaped largely by the more affluent nations, remain largely unresponsive to those crises.@@@A united front can compel the global community to sit up, to listen and to act.@@@The developing world must build that unity of purpose — not in confrontation, but in collaboration; not in division, but in cooperation.@@@Today I call on the nations that have been excluded from global decision-making and that have been left behind to bridge the separation of their geographical distance and to join together to advance their collective interest.@@@That is why Antigua and Barbuda has embarked on strategies, building alliances with the willing to counter the threats we face from the impacts of climate change and the failure of the international financial institutions and their policymakers to respond to the urgent needs of our peoples.@@@One of those initiatives which is currently taking place, was initiated two years ago in the margins of the twenty-sixth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP26) in Glasgow by the Prime Minister of Tuvalu.@@@Kausea Natano, and myself.@@@Frustrated by the lip service being paid by the world’s major emitters and the broken promises of every previous COP meeting, we decided that we would seek an advisory opinion from the International Tribunal of the Law of the Sea (ITLOS), concerning the obligation of States to combat pollution linked to climate change and its ensuing marine repercussions, such as rising ocean temperatures, sea-level rise and ocean acidification.@@@Joined by other small island States, we co-founded the Commission of Small Island States on Climate Change and International Law (COSIS).@@@COSIS sought and received a favourable agreement by ITLOS to hear our pleadings, which began on 11 September in Hamburg and will continue until 25 September.@@@Why did we go to ITLOS?@@@We went to ITLOS because it is the guardian of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.@@@It is the natural venue to seek legal clarity on the obligations Sf states to protect our marine environment.@@@Small island developing states (SIDs) are primarily maritime States.@@@We depend on the ocean not just for sustenance, but as a crucial part of our heritage and identity.@@@The ocean is also a vital carbon sink.@@@With increasing ocean and terrestrial temperatures reaching record highs this summer, literally burning the planet and simultaneously causing unprecedented storms, flooding and droughts, all nations must act now to safeguard the oceans as a critical component of the Earth’s climate system.@@@The countries of COSIS are not seeking to rewrite laws; we are seeking clarity on existing ones.@@@SIDs cannot sit idly by while our countries sink beneath our feet or are crippled by a burden of debt as we are left, abandoned by the international system, to rebuild within our own limited means, one disaster after another.@@@However, taking a case to ITLOS is not an initiative just for the survival of SIDs.@@@It is a vital effort for the preservation and prosperity of all nations in our shared world.@@@In that connection.@@@Antigua and Barbuda and the other members of COSIS will also stand with the General Assembly in its decision, initiated by Vanuatu, to seek an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice on the obligations of States with respect to climate change.@@@We consider this to be a duty of care for the peoples of the world.@@@Another bold initiative we have championed revolves around the multidimensional vulnerability index (MVI), as set out by General Assembly in December 2021.@@@Why the MVI?@@@Because it is crucial.@@@SIDs, though not the poorest countries, are extremely vulnerable to climate and other shocks, and lack resilience due to structural problems of limited human and financial resources, lack of economies of scale and higher costs due to their isolation from major manufacturing hubs.@@@Therefore, the sole criterion of per capita income, denying us access to concessional financing, is unfair and unjust.@@@The MVI is not just a tool; it is our gateway to essential financing, to robust national planning and to debt servicing and, possibly, our final beacon when seeking insurance and compensation against the rising tides.@@@We intend to continue to advance those contentions in the international financial institutions.@@@Particularly, we will raise that urgent issue at the joint meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in Marrakesh next month.@@@We call on all SIDs and all fair-minded countries to join us is advancing the MVI as a vital component in facilitating access to concessional financing.@@@Antigua and Barbuda greatly looks forward to hosting the fourth International Conference on Small Island Developing States from 27 May to 30 2024, under the theme “Charting the course towards resilient prosperity”.@@@I have highlighted the stark realities faced by SIDs.@@@We are grappling with the impacts of global phenomena, from the lingering effects of the coronavirus disease to climate change and the international economic and financial repercussions of Russia’s incursion into Ukraine.@@@Additionally, we are burdened with staggering debts, unfavourable trade terms and a global financial architecture that fails to meet our needs.@@@Our upcoming conference is therefore more than just a forum.@@@We must aim to develop a bold, decade-long strategy that will illuminate the path forward, addressing our unique and interconnected challenges to ensure a resilient and prosperous future for our citizens.@@@Given those challenges, and in 
collaboration with the private sector and United Nations entities.@@@Antigua and Barbuda will establish a centre of excellence for SIDs that will enable all SIDs to achieve sustainable resilient prosperity.@@@The truth is unavoidable — many major greenhouse gas-emitting countries have not met their commitments.@@@The previously set boundary — a temperature rise of no more than 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels — will be breached on the current trajectory.@@@The risks we face are not just on the horizon; they are here and they are now, requiring an urgent commitment to reducing emissions.@@@Small island States’ capacity to adjust and to build resilience cannot keep pace with the fast occurrence of extreme climate events.@@@And I emphasize that we will suffer first.@@@But what we will endure is only the precursor of the fate of every nation.@@@We are all running out of time, and we need to act now to save our one planet.@@@The twenty-eighth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Dubai will be crucial for the future of the planet.@@@Not only does COP28 come at a time when the world is witnessing climate chaos, but the summit is particularly important because it will include a global stocktake.@@@Countries will assess how far they have come on cutting planet-heating pollution.@@@However, the awful truth is already clear.@@@Eight years after the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, global progress has been far from sufficient.@@@The world is currently not in line with the temperature targets outlined in the Paris Agreement.@@@According to the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service, this year’s June-to-August period was not only the warmest since 1940, but it also saw temperatures soaring towards 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.@@@A red line once deemed sacrosanct will be crossed if urgent action is not taken.@@@Warnings have turned to imminent danger.@@@Therefore, what was already a crucial matter for action at COP28 has now become an imperative for action, and that is the Loss and Damage Fund for which small island States have been praying, pleading and literally begging — not that we should be begging.@@@We must recall that all that happened at COP27 last year is that the world’s greatest polluters agreed, only at the last minute, that such a fund was important.@@@But agreement was not establishment.@@@What we got was the formation of a transitional committee to make recommendations for consideration at COP28.@@@Certainly, that was not sufficient.@@@The issue was once again deferred.@@@Now we must insist at COP28 that the Loss and Damage Fund be made operational and adequately funded.@@@It must provide adequate financing to help SIDs withstand the inevitable ruin that the actions of the major polluters are continuing to wreak.@@@If COP28 fails in that critical mission, it risks undermining global trust and potentially sabotaging cooperative efforts on myriad global challenges.@@@It is my ardent hope that when we gather in Dubai, the shared spirit of responsibility will prevail, such that the dying embers of hope can be reignited by the flame of action.@@@Antigua and Barbuda unequivocally asserts that climate justice and reparatory justice are deeply intertwined.@@@They are inseparable.@@@It is essential for the Assembly to understand that climate justice is not a stand-alone concern.@@@As I said earlier, the issues are inseparable.@@@Historically, the nations that thrived on the industrial revolution did so on the backs of enslaved and victimized generations from the Caribbean and other corners of the African diaspora.@@@It is unjust that the countries that paid the highest human price are bearing the heaviest climate burden.@@@I say that that is unjust and must be addressed with a sense of urgency.@@@A recent United Nations report aptly underscores that while legal routes to compensation may be complex, it by no means nullifies the moral and ethical obligations arising from those historical wrongs.@@@Those historical wrongs must be addressed, and we urge the nations complicit in the dark legacy of enslavement to recognize, reconcile and redress soonest.@@@Our shared future must be built on justice, understanding and cooperation.@@@Another pivotal theme of this general debate resonates deeply with us — that is, rebuilding trust and reigniting global solidarity, which now stands on shaky ground.@@@It is worth emphasizing that no nation, large or small, can truly flourish amid such global turbulence.@@@Particularly for smaller States like mine, which rely heavily on the consistent hum of global stability for essential sectors like tourism, the stakes are incredibly high.@@@Our plea is simple.@@@We beseech the world’s formidable nations to engage in dialogue and embrace mutual respect.@@@Those are not just pathways to global peace, but also the avenues that ensure the prosperity of every citizen.@@@Drawing on that theme of trust.@@@I urge the United States to revisit its stance on Cuba.@@@It is high time for the United States to remove Cuba from its list of State sponsors of terrorism — they know it is not true — and to bring an end to the outdated embargo that harms the 
Cuban populace.@@@That policy against Cuba is cruel and wicked and ought to be addressed with urgency.@@@Similarly, we advocate the removal of sanctions on Venezuela, especially those that hinder the Venezuelan Government’s access to the United States financial system and literally block oil imports from the State-owned Petroleos de Venezuela company.@@@It cannot be ignored that those sanctions amplify the humanitarian crisis in Venezuela, contributing to the very large number of refugees into neighbouring countries.@@@The United States ought to take responsibility for the great number of refugees and not blame the Administration in Venezuela.@@@The sanctions also harm innocent Caribbean countries that hitherto benefitted from the PetroCaribe initiative, which served as an energy price stabilization mechanism for those countries.@@@We are hurting too, and that is why we argue in this forum that the sanctions should be lifted.@@@As Members of the United Nations, we are all bound by its Charter, which enshrines dialogue and peaceful conflict resolution.@@@Today I fervently urge every nation to recommit to those cornerstone principles, ensuring they are respected and followed as the bedrock of all international relations.@@@I now turn to the crisis in Haiti.@@@The enduring challenges faced by Haiti remain at the forefront of international consciousness.@@@Historically, the scars of Haiti’s struggle for freedom from enslavement are juxtaposed against the exploitative economic interests of France in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and have left deep imprints.@@@The burden of compensating France for over a century, essentially buying their liberty, has curtailed the development prospects of the Haitian people for generations.@@@Subsequent interventions compounded those challenges.@@@Internally, episodes of autocratic leadership have further eroded the national fabric.@@@The recent mission by the CARICOM Eminent Persons Group, seeking a resolution to Haiti’s political deadlock, voiced deep concerns over the rising dominance of gangs and the ensuing human rights crisis.@@@The immediate imperatives are clear.@@@An urgent, comprehensive, coordinated intervention is required; that will concurrently restore governance, security and the rule of law, while resolving the humanitarian crisis.@@@The CARICOM eminent persons strongly recommended that a broad-based transitional Government be the linchpin for effective governance.@@@It is our aspiration that this proposed representative transitional Government will materialize to provide the necessary leadership that is required, with external assistance to restore order and bring lasting peace and prosperity to the Haitian people.@@@Antigua and Barbuda stands resolutely in solidarity with the Haitian people.@@@In that regard.@@@I reaffirm my Government’s pledge to collaborate with all Haitian stakeholders and with the international community in the efforts to reinstate the rule law, restore democracy and assist with security and humanitarian relief.@@@The people of Haiti deserve no less.@@@I now turn to the use of illegal guns.@@@The use of illegal guns accounts for a significant percentage of all recorded homicides in the Caribbean.@@@At an average homicide rate of 15.1 per 100.000 people, the region has one of the highest homicide rates in the world — three times the world average.@@@Yet no country — not one — in the Caribbean manufactures a single weapon or one round of ammunition.@@@The majority of those weapons originates in the United States, from which they are smuggled or trafficked to bolster organised criminals involved in trafficking illicit narcotics.@@@In any event, the fallout from these illegal guns is their increasing use in Caribbean countries and the clear threat that they pose to our societies and the capacity of our law enforcement to cope.@@@Given that all our countries are bordered by vast expanses of sea, we face further challenges to obtain modern technology, including satellite imagery, radar and surveillance systems, to try to stop the smuggling of weapons.@@@But while our region is confronting the threats to our security, arising from illegal traditional weapons, we are even more alarmed at the potential for autonomous weapons to fall into the hands of organized criminals.@@@Let us consider a drone, meticulously programmed with facial recognition technology, set to target an individual.@@@It scans, identifies and eliminates its target, all while operating undetected.@@@That is not the plot of a dystopian novel, but a looming reality.@@@Just a month ago, under the theme of A New Agenda for Peace, the Secretary- General sounded the alarm bell.@@@He has urged nations to formulate a legally binding instrument by 2026 to prohibit lethal autonomous weapon systems.@@@Antigua and Barbuda fully support that recommendation, and we will work with other nations to successfully conclude an international treaty that shields our societies and safeguards our national security from this threat.@@@Antigua and Barbuda is small in size, without military might or financial influence, but our spirit stands tall.@@@We refuse to let our size diminish our voice or lessen our rightful place at the decision-making table.@@@Since our first steps as a sovereign State in 1981, we have championed a world where equity, fairness and social justice are not mere buzzwords, but lived realities.@@@And yet, with a heavy heart we note the ever-widening chasm between the affluent and the struggling, between those who hold the reins of power and those who yearn for their rightful share.@@@Year after year, leaders like me stand on this rostrum.@@@We speak of financial justice and of climate justice, but our cries, it seems, echo in a vast void.@@@Words abound, but transformative action remains elusive.@@@I often sense the scepticism from my fellow citizens when they ask: Why speak when it feels like the world is not truly listening?@@@But I remember this; during the coronavirus disease pandemic, it was the tiniest of microbes, unseen and unanticipated, that brought nations great and small to their knees.@@@It was not an arsenal of weapons or a mountain of wealth that provided a beacon in those dark times; it was global cooperation.@@@Let us not forget — it was collective global action.@@@The same truth applies beyond pandemics.@@@Whether we aim for a world steeped in peace, basking in prosperity or forward-looking in progress, our only hope lies in banding together.@@@We are all part of human civilization.@@@We are all fundamentally one and the same people and we must band together.@@@Every nation, regardless of its power or wealth, shares that interwoven destiny.@@@Therefore, let us never relent in our pursuit of change.@@@For the sake of humanity, for our shared planet, let us shape a world that is not only better but also just, prosperous and inclusive for all.@@@Antigua and Barbuda stands ready, as ever, to play its part.@@@We call on the powerful and rich States to do the same.@@@We are here to renew our commitment to the ideals and principles that animate the United Nations — peace, the diplomatic resolution of conflicts and respect for human rights and freedoms.@@@In this brief address.@@@I will share our vision and efforts to address the global challenges we face, from climate change and chronic child malnutrition to the most urgent threats to our security.@@@Since the beginning of my Administration, we have implemented a historic environmental transition policy that preserves our natural heritage.@@@At the same time, we have made great strides in the transition from unsustainable production systems to a circular and low- emission economy.@@@In January 2022, we expanded the protection of the Galapagos Islands with the creation of the Hermandad Marine Reserve, which has an area of 60.000 square kilometres.@@@This decision constitutes the greatest advance in my country’s history towards 
the preservation of our incomparable biodiversity.@@@In addition, we strengthened the Eastern Tropical Pacific Marine Corridor in a unity of purpose with our sister nations of Colombia.@@@Costa Rica and Panama, and together we have created the world’s largest transboundary reserve, protecting 500.000 square kilometres inhabited by countless unique species that use those migratory routes.@@@We did it for our peoples and for the world.@@@Above all, my Government has been able to balance environmental concerns with good economic sense.@@@We have pioneered the implementation of an innovative debt-for-conservation swap initiative that redirects resources to the protection of the Galapagos Islands — which is certainly great news for the world.@@@The debt swap amounted to $1.63 billion, making it the largest operation of its kind in the history of humankind.@@@That figure is equivalent to 10 per cent of the public debt owed by Ecuador to external private creditors.@@@Of that amount.@@@$450 million will be directed to the Galapagos Life Fund, for the protection of marine ecosystems and their more than 2.500 species.@@@38 of which are migratory.@@@We are thereby showing the world how debt and all its attendant financial burden can be turned into various kinds of opportunities.@@@We therefore want to take this opportunity to express our concern about the imminent and increasingly likely El Nino phenomenon, which could cause devastating floods in Ecuador and throughout the region.@@@On the threshold of the potential occurrence of an event of such proportions, we have prioritized prevention and are working together with the United Nations to seek financing alternatives through multilateral organizations.@@@We call on the international community to consider risk-mitigation measures through large financial funds and non-reimbursable international cooperation, given that it is climate change that will determine the severity of the phenomenon.@@@We are facing an enormous task that will require a coordinated approach by all sectors of the international community if we are to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and safeguard the future of all.@@@However, our concerns are not limited to environmental issues.@@@We are also focusing on improving the quality of life of the most disadvantaged sectors of society, particularly children.@@@In the face of the alarming numbers that we identified regarding chronic child malnutrition, we have been implementing the successful Ecuador Grows Without Child Malnutrition programme, through which, in just 28 months, we have reduced the rate of malnutrition in children under two years old by 3.5 per cent, lowering the overall figure from 23.6 per cent to 20.1 per cent.
Children who suffer malnutrition at that stage of life face grave and irreversible consequences.@@@It affects their neurological development and ability to learn, communicate, think and relate to others.@@@In other words, those children are faced with enormous disadvantages from the beginning of their lives that will have a negative impact on their future.@@@In view of that painful reality, we have been implementing our public programme strategically, by providing pregnant women and children in their first 1.000 days of life with medicines and vitamins, in addition to refitting and equipping health centres, recruiting more doctors specializing in family medicine, obstetricians and nurses, and hiring 50.000 community workers to monitor neighbourhoods in order to detect cases of malnutrition in a timely manner.@@@Thanks to that action, more than 20.000 children under the age of two are free from chronic malnutrition, and my Government has achieved all of that through an investment of $650 million in a matter of 28 months in office.@@@Achieving solutions does not depend on how much money a State has but on the degree of political will of those who govern it.@@@Even in a context of lower- than-average oil prices, my Government has prioritized State resources for this cause because there can be no growth or economic development if we do not invest in social issues and in our children.@@@We hope to share our experience with everyone here in this Hall and to unite our efforts so that in the near future we can all say together that the world is growing without child malnutrition.@@@Ecuador is striving to promote safe and responsible migration.@@@We are one of the few countries that has experienced every facet of migration.@@@We are a country of origin, destination, transit, return and even refuge.@@@Migration has been a challenge for the region in recent years, as it involves addressing complex situations that create great challenges with cultural, economic and social implications.@@@Given the fact that Ecuador has welcomed thousands of migrants of various nationalities, identifying their distinct needs, conditions, experiences and activities has become a key objective in ensuring a comprehensive approach.@@@In that regard, we have launched a registration process for foreign nationals residing in our country, regardless of their immigration status, and that registry now numbers some 201.000 persons.@@@Most of them are Venezuelan citizens who arrived in Ecuador fleeing hunger and authoritarianism.@@@We want to give them a better future, guarantee all of their rights and grant them humanitarian visas so that they can regularize their status and integrate more easily into society.@@@We have opened our arms to protect those who have sought refuge in our country.@@@Children, with or without documents, are admitted into schools, and anyone can receive care in our public hospitals.@@@However, that open-door policy requires the valued support of the international community.@@@Our action has been consistent and supportive, and we humbly expect reciprocal cooperation.@@@After 31 years, this year Ecuador took on the challenge of returning to the Security Council.@@@We did so at a critical time for humankind and in the context of extremely complex situations, including the global vulnerability in the wake of the pandemic and an unexpected military conflict that has increased nuclear tensions.@@@Meanwhile, new problems related to radicalization and violent extremism have also been emerging, and Ecuador has risen to the challenge.@@@During the nine months of our membership on the Council, we have consistently acted in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, prioritizing the peaceful resolution of conflicts, the protection of civilians, the women and peace and security agenda and the fight against illegal arms trafficking.@@@Our actions have responded in particular to new threats such as transnational organized crime, which undermines democratic stability, citizens’ security and the rule of law.@@@I want to reiterate the statement I made at the Council’s high-level meeting this morning on Ukraine (see 8/?V.9421), in which I urged once again for an end to the military aggression in compliance with the order issued by the International Court of Justice, and for progress towards a peace based on the territorial integrity of Ukraine and the Charter.@@@We have warned that the conflict is not only inflicting pain and destruction on the people of Ukraine but also worsening global food insecurity and destabilizing the global economy, especially for developing countries.@@@We therefore insist on the resumption of the Black Sea Grain Initiative.@@@All wars and conflicts must end.@@@I shall devote the remainder of my statement to an issue that is of the utmost concern to Ecuador and the world — the historic moment that required that I become Head of a State that, like few others, faces the violent siege of an enemy whose allies traverse the porous borders that continue to divide the legal world from the illegal world.@@@I refer to transnational organized crime, in particular drug trafficking and its dangerous and growing ramifications in the public sphere.@@@My Government has broken records in drug seizures.@@@We have seized more than 500 tons in just two years, a figure that far exceeds that of previous Governments.@@@What we face today are the repercussions of the blow dealt to the pockets of criminals.@@@Our policy has had such an impact that, last year, the United Nations recognized Ecuador as the third-foremost country globally in the seizure of drugs, after the United States and Colombia.@@@A few weeks ago.@@@Ecuador experienced an unprecedented event in its history: the assassination of a presidential candidate.@@@I refer to Fernando Villavicencio, a brilliant and brave Ecuadorian who boldly denounced the operations of organized crime and its links with political mafias.@@@Transnational organized crime is a corrupting and murderous system that infiltrates society and the State, challenges the democratic stability of our countries and develops at great speed.@@@The problem is not exclusive to Ecuador; it is a global problem, given that much of the planet suffers from the same phenomena as Ecuador — trafficking in drugs, weapons and humans, forced migration and illegal mining.@@@If we do not fight together, we will continue to suffer alone.@@@If the enemy has the capacity to multiply, then States must multiply our efforts even faster.@@@It is imperative for the future survival of States that we establish lasting, robust and effective mechanisms to put an end to criminal organizations and those who sponsor or cover up for them.@@@If we wish to fully share the benefits of the globalized world, we must also confront together the adversities that entails.@@@In that and each of the battles we face together.@@@States can always count on the unwavering commitment of Ecuador.@@@In 1864.@@@Abraham Lincoln wrote a letter to Edwin Stanton, his Secretary of War.@@@He observed that “you cannot escape the responsibility of tomorrow by evading it today”.@@@It was a different time, with different problems and different ways of solving them.@@@A lot has changed since then, and yet Lincoln’s words remain as relevant as ever.@@@They show that “responsibility” has always been a watchword, because our very future depends on whether we choose or refuse to take responsibility.@@@Today there is no time to be lost.@@@There has never been so much at stake at one time.@@@We must combat climate change, fight hunger and poverty, and protect peace and security in many places all over the world.@@@It is human nature to prioritize the issues that affect us most directly.@@@Let us be honest — that goes for all of us here today.@@@Every one of us has come here to discuss the issues we face in our own countries, but if we look beyond our borders we see that none of those issues stands alone.@@@All the big issues of our time intersect.@@@Their impact is global.@@@Let us consider climate change, or poverty, or conflict.@@@Those issues are all related and we are all affected by them, though perhaps not always in the same way.@@@In Europe, peace has been shattered by Russian aggression.@@@And yes.@@@I am asking once again for support in ending that terrible war.@@@At the same time.@@@I realize that some here are thinking: “What about our own challenges?@@@What about our own security?@@@Will you support us there as well?”@@@I understand how they feel, and they are right.@@@As the late Secretary-General Kofi Annan put it.@@@“If the United Nations is not as united as it should be, that is because it is a reflection of the world we live in”.@@@And he was also right.@@@For too long at the United Nations, some interests have weighed more heavily than others.@@@The United Nations is structured as if it were still 1945, but the world has changed.@@@It has taken a long time for that realization to sink in, but once you see it you cannot un-see it.@@@In this world at this time, we all need each other — all 193 countries — because we all face a common task.@@@Let us consider the global distribution of wealth.@@@The Netherlands is not only one of the United Nations most loyal development donors; we also support the reform plans of institutions such as the World Bank.@@@Or let us consider climate change.@@@We need to reduce our footprint — a footprint that leaves its mark on countries far beyond our borders.@@@So that is what we are doing, by building a circular economy by 2050, by making our financial sector more sustainable and by combating deforestation and loss of biodiversity.@@@In each of those areas, partnerships are essential — above all, partnerships with the countries hit hardest by climate change.@@@Today I will speak with the representatives of several small island developing States about climate adaptation and about ways of exchanging knowledge, expertise and innovative solutions.@@@And yes, such partnerships begin with talking, but they must go beyond words and promises.@@@The Netherlands is increasing its annual contribution to international climate finance to €1.8 billion by 2025, and over half of that will go to climate adaptation.@@@Everyone understands how important that is.@@@In two months’ time we will gather in Dubai to take stock of our progress towards the Paris climate goals, but we already know that we are way off track, so something has to be done right now.@@@The Netherlands will fulfil its responsibility, by providing 100 million people in developing countries with access to renewable energy by 2030, by massively scaling up our renewable energy investment and by helping to set up and scale up green-hydrogen corridors, together with South Africa.@@@Egypt.@@@Morocco.@@@Namibia and others.@@@Currently, only 2 per cent of global investment goes to Africa, despite the huge potential there.@@@We have a collective interest in making sure that potential can be tapped, because if we do not help Africa to grow sustainably, we will all miss our climate goals.@@@The twenty-eighth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change must mark a course correction.@@@There, we must agree and explain how the world will get on track to meet the 1.5°C goal.@@@If we do not, the consequences will be disastrous.@@@The examples I have offered of Dutch action, working together with our Kingdom partners in the Caribbean, show that we are willing to fulfil our responsibility, that we are willing to pick up the phone and to answer the knock at the door.@@@The most striking of truths is also the most obvious: We are not as different as we might think.@@@What unites us is bigger and stronger than what divides us.@@@I see that in my bilateral discussions.@@@I see it in the European Union, and I see it here at the United Nations.@@@However different our backgrounds are, however different our 
countries, we share the same universal values: peace, freedom and justice.@@@On 17 July 2014, those values, which the Netherlands holds so dear, were trampled underfoot.@@@It was the day that flight MH-17 was downed by Russia — the day the Dutch people and people everywhere were reminded, in such a painful manner, that peace, freedom and justice are not givens, but require our constant efforts.@@@Those values, those collective aims, form the basis of the United Nations.@@@They are the reason we are here today.@@@With that in mind.@@@I would like to talk about Ukraine.@@@Every day, millions of people feel the effects of Russia’s aggression — above all the Ukrainian people, who are the victims of terrible crimes.@@@Every day they live in fear.@@@Am I still safe in my own home?@@@In my city?@@@Will I ever see my family alive again?@@@Those are questions that no one should ever have to ask.@@@In Europe, we thought we would never need to ask them again, but we were wrong@@@and so now it is up to us to respond, to pick up the phone and to answer the knock at the door.@@@We cannot leave one country to fend for itself.@@@I know that some countries are hesitating, asking themselves why they should get involved in someone else’s war.@@@To them.@@@I say: “It is your war too, because even if there is no shooting in your towns and your cities are not being bombed, this war affects everyone”.@@@People in vulnerable countries know exactly what I am talking about.@@@The global food supply is being used as a weapon of war and food prices are soaring.@@@Millions of people are being pushed back into poverty and hunger.@@@And it is precisely the most vulnerable countries that are being hit the hardest.@@@We will not find them on the official casualty list, but those countries and the people who live there are also victims of Putin’s aggression.@@@Russia’s conduct goes against everything that we in the United Nations stand for.@@@That alone is reason enough to take action.@@@The Charter of the United Nations, our common foundation, is very clear on that.@@@When push comes to shove, we cannot neglect our duty because it is not convenient, because we have other things on our minds or because it seems too hard.@@@No!@@@No!@@@No!@@@The Charter is intended for moments like these for a time and a place like this.@@@The General Assembly is the ultimate place and now is the time to hold each other to account and remind each other of our responsibilities.@@@That goes for all of us, and it goes for me too.@@@I have explained how the Netherlands will fulfil its responsibility.@@@Members can hold us to that, and they can call us to account for our actions.@@@In the same way.@@@I am calling on everyone to speak out against Putin and Russia’s violation of the United Nations Charter, to support the peace plan, to support Ukraine, even if it takes time and even if there are setbacks — especially if it takes time and there are setbacks — and to tell Russia to give back the stolen children of Ukraine.@@@Some countries feel they are supporting peace in Ukraine simply by calling for an immediate ceasefire.@@@They think that this will help end the war and that peace, freedom and security will return automatically.@@@They see it as an expression of nuance.@@@They want to see the good in others.@@@They do not want to point the finger of blame.@@@In the case of the war in Ukraine, there is no shared blame.@@@There is no doubt about who the perpetrator is and who the victim.@@@Russia attacked Ukraine, a sovereign nation, and not the other way round.@@@So there can be no shared solution.@@@Russia is the aggressor here and it is not Ukraine’s supporters who are prolonging the war — it is Russia.@@@Putin has occupied 20 per cent of Ukraine.@@@An immediate ceasefire now would mean victory for Russia.@@@That is the reality, and a just and lasting peace can be achieved only if we recognize that reality.@@@There is a lot at stake here.@@@Putin is counting on us being divided.@@@He is counting on us ending our support as the war drags on longer and costs more than we thought.@@@He is counting on us losing interest and returning to our own problems.@@@That is Putin’s strategy.@@@And now that push has come to shove, we must show that we have learned from the past, that we will all pick up the phone, that we will all answer the knock at the door and that we will all fulfil our responsibility.@@@Let me begin by congratulating Mr. Dennis Francis on his election to his important high office.@@@It is a testament to one of our key principles — that small island developing States (SIDS) can lead and SIDs must lead.@@@I also thank Mr. Csaba Korosi for his leadership of the seventy-seventh session.@@@We commend the Secretary-General for his leadership and commit our full support for his tremendous work.@@@Our global community today is grappling with multifaceted challenges, from ongoing and new conflicts to pandemics, climate change to food insecurities, gender-based inequalities to intolerance.@@@Addressing them requires recommitting to the values of peace, prosperity, progress and sustainability.@@@We firmly support President Francis’s priorities.@@@The Maldives has always been a principled and committed member of the Organisation.@@@Just five days ago, we celebrated 58 years since we gained membership of the United Nations.@@@Over the past 58 years, the Maldives has reaped the many benefits that multilateralism has to offer.@@@From being the poorest country upon gaining our independence, we became only the third country to graduate from least developed country status.@@@We have assumed leadership roles.@@@And our track record, our credentials and our achievements speak for themselves.@@@We have demonstrated that neither size nor vulnerability holds us back, but hope, commitment and our principles drive us forward.@@@We have approached every session of the General Assembly in that same spirit.@@@And for the seventy-eighth session, the Maldives wishes to highlight six areas of focus that will guide our engagement in this crucial body.@@@First, we will work towards ensuring a more fair, just and equitable multilateral system, one that caters to everyone, but especially its weakest and the smallest.@@@Small States deserve a seat at the table.@@@We have the most to gain from multilateralism and indeed, the most to lose.@@@Small States know that a rules-based international order, one where all States have an equitable voice, is essential.@@@Small States know that shared problems can be solved only through shared solutions.@@@Small States stand up for principles because it is those principles that will safeguard us in our time of need.@@@Small States like the Maldives have therefore always looked at ways to contribute.@@@That is why we have put forward our candidatures to the Security Council, for the term 2033-2034; the Economic and Social Council, for the term 2027-2029; and to the Committee on the Rights on the Child, for the term 2025-2029.@@@Enhancing the representation of small States in decision-making bodies is essential to ensure that the Organisation lives up to its ideal to leave no one behind.@@@A fair, just and equitable multilateral system also requires the revitalization of the United Nations as a whole.@@@At the forefront of that revitalization is the much-needed reform of the Security Council, a goal the Maldives has advocated for from the very beginning.@@@In 1979, we were among the 10 countries that requested the inclusion of an agenda item on the agenda of the General Assembly on the question of equitable representation and expansion of the Security Council.@@@Today we reiterate our calls to increase the number of permanent and non-permanent seats alike, while ensuring equitable geographic representation.@@@We reiterate our call for a dedicated seat for small island developing States (SIDS) in an expanded Security Council.@@@We believe that this will make the Council more responsive and responsible.@@@Secondly, we must confront the climate crisis.@@@Warming beyond 1.5°C will lead to catastrophic ecological loss, causing severe damage to our lives and livelihoods.@@@We have recognized that the climate crisis is a threat to security, development and human rights at 
multiple platforms.@@@We are proud to have led the work towards the adoption of the landmark resolution 76/300, recognizing the human right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment, a milestone we celebrated in this very Hall last year.@@@Domestically, we will continue to display strong and ambitious climate action.@@@We have a net zero target of 2030.@@@We are conserving and protecting parts of our ocean, marine species and corals, and we are taking concrete steps to phase out single-use plastics.@@@At the upcoming the twenty-eighth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP28), we must all raise climate ambition to secure our future, for the future.@@@As we approach the first ever global stocktake at COP28, science must be given precedence.@@@We must make an urgent call to close the gap between ambition and implementation.@@@A definitive road map to reduce emissions, in line with the main goals of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, is crucial.@@@We must also see adaptation as a universal challenge and demand adequate financing.@@@We must operationalize and capitalize the Loss and Damage Fund and scale up existing funding arrangements.@@@Given the inherent link between climate and the ocean, we must also do more to protect that vast and important resource.@@@As a large ocean State, we have an intrinsic responsibility to protect the ocean and its marine resources — a responsibility many of us share.@@@We have seen the value of working together to fight climate change and protect our environment.@@@Earlier this year, we asked the International Court of Justice for an advisory opinion on the obligation of States with respect to climate change.@@@The historic Kunming- Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework was adopted, promising to deliver for nature.@@@The historic agreement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction was adopted, and we call for international support to build capacity in implementing provisions of the agreement.@@@We also call for ambition during the intergovernmental negotiations to develop an international legally binding instrument to end plastic pollution.@@@It is time to turn agreement into action!@@@Our third priority area is to renew our commitment to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development with the provision of adequate and sustainable financing for development.@@@The Sustainable Development Goals Summit and the High-level Dialogue on Financing for Development have already expressed our collective commitment towards addressing these issues.@@@Today we stand at the midpoint of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda.@@@The Maldives showcased its progress, presenting our second voluntary national review in July at the High-level Political Forum.@@@We identified that physical and digital connectivity can accelerate our achievement of the 2030 Agenda.@@@Recognizing that, the Government of Maldives has established an Integrated National Public Ferry Network, which connects our widely dispersed islands to one another.@@@We are also undergoing a digital revolution, with the proliferation of online education, telemedicine and e-payment systems.@@@We are bringing services closer to the people who need them.@@@Those efforts are, in turn, supporting micro, small and medium-sized enterprises — the backbone of our economy.@@@The provision of easy payment procedures, coupled with enhanced physical connectivity, have expanded the reach of such businesses beyond individual islands.@@@Issues like this are what we intend to bring to the fourth International Conference on SIDS next year.@@@As co-Chair of the Preparatory Committee for the Conference, we witnessed a robust foundation laid out during the preparatory meetings for a forward looking and action-oriented programme of action for SIDS.@@@We also recognize that sustainable development can truly be fostered with sustainable and affordable financing.@@@We need a global response to guarantee the necessary liquidity support for developing countries, especially SIDS, to facilitate a recovery that addresses the scale of the debt burden, exacerbated by the coronavirus disease pandemic.@@@And so, the international financial institutions must reassess their eligibility criteria in providing concessional loans and grants.@@@They must look beyond gross domestic product as the sole measure of development.@@@The answer lies with the early adoption and use of the multidimensional vulnerability index.@@@We urge the international financial institutions to use the index as a tool, ensuring that the vulnerabilities of developing countries are integrated into decision-making, enabling easier access to affordable financing and debt relief.@@@Our fourth focus area of focus is eliminating gender barriers and ensuring gender equality.@@@Women deserve more than a seat at the table; they should play an active and equal role in shaping decisions.@@@The Maldives is 
committed to its endeavours as a champion for women’s rights and gender equality.@@@One of our initiatives in that regard was the establishment of the International Day of Women in Diplomacy, celebrated every year on 24 June.@@@We recognize the invaluable role of women in diplomacy, who continue to lead us towards a more sustainable future, and it is our hope that the seats behind me on this rostrum will one day be occupied by women.@@@Together we must work to promote and protect human rights, one of the pillars of our foreign policy and our fifth area of focus.@@@The need to protect human rights was the basis of our democratic journey.@@@The right to express ourselves without reprisal; the right to peaceful assembly; the right to freely choose our leaders — those rights are sacred.@@@This month, the first round of our presidential elections went ahead in a peaceful, festive and orderly manner.@@@In that election, we saw a record number of candidates, which we believe to be a sign of a maturing democracy.@@@We assure the global community that the run-off, which will be held in just a few days, will also proceed in a similarly peaceful, festive and orderly manner.@@@Our firm commitment to protecting human rights at home is mirrored by our international engagements.@@@I am proud to share that, with our recent ratification of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, the Maldives is now a State party to eight of the core international human rights conventions.@@@We also take great pride in our active participation in the Human Rights Council since its inception.@@@We are glad to assume our role as a Council member once again this year, also serving as Vice-President from the Group of Asia-Pacific States.@@@We will work with all States towards the protection of human rights around the world.@@@In that regard, we recently made a written submission to the International Court of Justice demonstrating our support for the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people — a cause that deeply resonates with us.@@@Their rights can be most effectively protected only through a two- State solution based on the pre-1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as the capital of an independent and sovereign State of Palestine.@@@This brings me to our sixth and final area of focus — upholding international peace and security.@@@The Maldives advocates for the unwavering adherence to the Charter of the United Nations.@@@The people of Ukraine.@@@Myanmar and many other countries across the world deserve peace and prosperity.@@@Most importantly, they deserve a dignified life.@@@We must also work towards bringing non-traditional security threats to the forefront of global discourse on peace and security.@@@Terrorism and violent extremism continue to plague us.@@@They transcends borders; they have no single face or faith.@@@As such, the Maldives remains resolute in its unwavering commitment to countering terrorism and extremism.@@@We condemn the repeated and public acts of the desecration of the Holy Quran in some European countries.@@@The repeated and public acts of desecration of the Holy Quran cannot be justified under the guise of freedom of speech and expression, and is of grave concern.@@@It is necessary to combat the rise of Islamophobia and hate speech through concerted global action.@@@We will also continue to raise our voice on the links between climate change and sea-level rise and peace and security, which are becoming more and more apparent.@@@Mutual respect and deep-seated cooperation are the cornerstones for effectively addressing our collective challenges.@@@Together, we have the potential to achieve peace.@@@Together, we can chart new paths towards sustainable development and together, we can leave behind a future that is better than what we found.@@@The Maldives will continue to collaborate with our fellow nations in the international community, united in our shared commitment, to deliver that vision.@@@It is a great honour for me to address the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session under the theme “Rebuilding trust and reigniting global solidarity: accelerating action on the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals towards peace, prosperity, progress and sustainability for all”.@@@In a world faced with complex challenges, such as climate change, poverty, inequality and resource depletion, it has become increasingly evident that sustainable development is not just a noble aspiration but an imperative for the survival and well-being of our planet and its inhabitants.@@@For 78 years, the United Nations has stood for the great ideal of building an international system of collaboration, solidarity and common purpose.@@@The values of the Charter of the United Nations, which are our road map today, will remain as such for generations to come because the United Nations is founded on the timeless ideals of global peace, security, development, human rights and global cooperation.@@@Today we need unity in our Organization more than ever before.@@@Among the multiple crises that we are experiencing are the impact of the coronavirus disease pandemic, geopolitical conflicts and wars and the climate change catastrophe.@@@Those have undermined our resilience and increased vulnerability to shocks and have significantly slowed the progress in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030.@@@Just as the founders of the United Nations once united to address the challenges of their time for the benefit of all, it is now our responsibility to stand together and confront those that we face today, rebuild trust and take swift action to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and the African Agenda 2063.@@@Of great concern are the conflicts around the world, the coups and the unconstitutional changes of Governments in several African States, which are negating the gains towards attaining our African Union goals.@@@We have also witnessed natural disasters in the form of floods and earthquakes that have claimed thousands of lives in Libya and Morocco, among other countries.@@@We wish to extend our sympathies and condolences to those who lost their loved ones.@@@The Kingdom of Eswatini wishes to encourage the efforts that are being undertaken to find a political solution to the matter regarding the Western Sahara within the parameters of Security Council resolution 2654 (2022).@@@We commend the Secretary-General and his Personal Envoy for advancing dialogue as a means of reaching a sustainable solution to the impasse.@@@To attain that, we need to actively practise tolerance and promote peace in all areas.@@@We owe it to ourselves to 
reignite global solidarity to achieve economic and social advancement for all our peoples.@@@The Kingdom of Eswatini embraces multilateral cooperation and prioritizes adherence to international law when looking to address the challenges posed by conflicts and wars.@@@We therefore support the global call for silencing of guns, which affect the most vulnerable groups.@@@We remain steadfast in our call for the peaceful resolution of conflicts and the continual improvement of democratic and inclusive governance.@@@The Kingdom of Eswatini therefore commends the Secretary-General for facilitating the New Agenda for Peace, which promotes the principles of trust and solidarity, which are foundations of the United Nations Charter.@@@Eswatini supports women’s empowerment and youth participation in decision-making for conflict prevention and development.@@@We should work to advance gender equality and end violence against women.@@@Our focus is on building accountable, effective and inclusive institutions, in line with SDG 16.@@@We established a legal aid office to enhance access to justice and the rule of law, especially for vulnerable and marginalized groups.@@@We have also developed an implementation plan for the Universal Periodic Review on Human Rights and have strengthened national institutions of monitoring and reporting frameworks to promote and protect human rights for all Emaswati.@@@Like all other Member States.@@@Eswatini’s implementation of the SDGs has been impacted by the multiple shocks at both the global and the national levels.@@@Notwithstanding those challenges, as a country, we remain steadfast in our commitment to achieving those targets.@@@We have been ranked among the top five by the World Bank for our growing economy, with our gross domestic product growth (GDP) at about 7.8 per cent.@@@We attained the second-highest manufacturing value added per capita country, and we are placed sixth on the 2022 Africa Industrialization Index.@@@Furthermore, we have been ranked number nine among the 10 African countries with the highest GDP per capita.@@@We will not rest on our laurels but will work much harder as we look to improve our economy.@@@The recent global challenges have had negative impacts on our ability to provide social services, including health and education.@@@Despite that, we have significantly reduced the rate of death under 5 years of age and the maternal mortality ratio in Eswatini.@@@The prevalence of the human immunodeficiency virus among adults aged 15 to 49 has also dropped.@@@We continue to work tirelessly to strengthen our healthcare systems, while also ensuring that our citizens have access to those essential services.@@@We commend the Secretary-General for the many initiatives aimed at helping Member States to better recover from such multiple shocks.@@@Following our participation in the Summit on Transforming Education last year, we are delighted to share that the country continues to increase opportunities for learning and skills development, including through the integration and use of digital technologies.@@@Significant strides have been made by the Kingdom of Eswatini in increasing access to electricity since the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@We now have national coverage of above 80 per cent.@@@Notable progress has also been made in terms of road and information and communication technology infrastructure, connecting cities and economic zones.@@@When it comes to access to basic water services.@@@69 per cent of the population now enjoys that necessity, and access to basic sanitation services has reached 58 per cent of our people.@@@The literacy rate among adults aged 15 and above has improved from 79 per cent in 2000 to 87 per cent.@@@The gross enrolment ratio for primary education has increased from 97 per cent in 2000 to 104 per cent.@@@In the lead-up to the Sustainable Development Goals Summit this week, the Kingdom of Eswatini undertook a series of consultations in every region, seeking the views of the people regarding how best to accelerate the attainment of the SDGs.@@@As a result, the Kingdom has prioritized investments in key areas in the remaining seven years.@@@We want to create decent jobs and employment opportunities for everyone, especially the youth.@@@We want to improve water and sanitation for all.@@@We are convinced that that will help to ensure maximum progress across all 17 SDGs.@@@Eswatini has continued to cherish its home-grown and unique model of people-driven democratic governance.@@@Like many other democracies, our Constitution recognizes the role of the monarchy, as well as a bicameral Parliament, the separation of powers, fundamental human rights and the rule of law.@@@It takes into account our rich cultural heritage and traditional African values, in that it is grounded 
in respect, consensus and community support through traditional structures.@@@It is a monarchical democracy.@@@Our system is based on individual merit, where candidates are nominated from their communities to stand for elections in constituencies that we call tinkhundla, to which they are accountable.@@@The electorate expects members of Parliament to meet as colleagues rather than combatants, to look for consensus as opposed to partisanship and to balance the interests of their constituencies with those of the nation.@@@In terms of our democratic dispensation, elections are a constitutional imperative and are held every five years.@@@Eswatini is in the middle of its electoral cycle in a bid to elect the twelfth Parliament.@@@In that regard, a voter registration exercise, which returned more than 95 per cent of people registered against an eligible population, was conducted.@@@That was a resounding success and a ringing endorsement of support for the system of Government.@@@As we speak, the nomination process has been completed.@@@Primary elections were held on 26 August, and our secondary elections will take place on 29 September.@@@We look forward to Emaswati expressing their desires through the ballot box.@@@The Sibaya — the people’s Parliament — remains one of our highest institutions, where Emaswati dialogue and play their part in determining the future that they want.@@@It is an inclusive forum, where citizens, irrespective of gender and social status, discuss issues of national interest.@@@A couple of weeks ago, the nation celebrated 55 years of our independence, during which Emaswati have been living in peace and harmony.@@@Eswatini has been hit hard by the coronavirus disease pandemic, which has affected some of our social sectors.@@@Although we have made progress in reducing poverty and inequality, they remain high.@@@As a result, we continue to battle with high unemployment, especially among young people.@@@With the support of the United Nations in Eswatini, we launched a youth empowerment programme, which has generated great public interest among the private sector.@@@We hope to enrol at least 4.000 young people into the programme to increase their chances of employment and to help them start their own businesses, including with access to financing.@@@The European Union has also pledged to support youth empowerment initiatives to mitigate the unemployment situation.@@@Eswatini is highly dependent on external sources of income, such as regional trade, remittances and transfers from the Southern African Customs Union.@@@We continue to implement structural reforms to improve our business environment, diversify our economy and foster inclusive growth.@@@We recently launched our national implementation strategy for the African Continental Free Trade Area agreement.@@@Two days ago, on the sidelines of the General Assembly, we had a resource mobilization session to introduce the Africa Strategic Investment Alliance.@@@That will support the Africa E-trade (AeTrade) programme, which seeks to create a digital marketing platform for all African countries to promote trading through technologies.@@@We are also looking to advanced countries to share their experiences so that Africa will not be left behind.@@@We urge Member States and financial institutions to support the AeTrade initiative.@@@We wish to commend the private sector, which participated in the forum and further committed itself to pledges towards that noble objective.@@@That will help us to take full advantage of the opportunities for intra-Africa trade, increase national productivity and promote regional integration in the world’s largest free trade area, which connects 1.3 billion people across 55 countries, with a combined gross domestic product valued at $3.4 trillion.@@@Eswatini is embracing the “leave no one behind” principle, which is the central promise of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Goals.@@@As we work towards achieving those targets, it is crucial to re-evaluate the global financial architecture.@@@We must address interest rates in a way that is fair and beneficial to both least developed and developing nations.@@@That will ensure the eradication of poverty in all its forms and improved living conditions for the poorest of the poor.@@@Sustaining the SDGs will require that Member States develop innovative financing strategies to ensure that implementation reaches those left furthest behind.@@@At this critical juncture, including Taiwan is an essential next step if we are to successfully achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@We call for Taiwan’s inclusion in the United Nations system, which encompasses participation in meetings, mechanisms and activities that pertain to the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@That would not only strengthen global cooperation and partnership, but it would also emphasize the principle of ensuring that no one is left behind.@@@In conclusion, in the remaining seven years.@@@Eswatini will continue to prioritize the implementation of the SDGs and ensure that they remain the core agenda behind our development.@@@We are optimistic that a broad range of actors will be mobilized and that capacities will be strengthened to ensure the achievement of the Goals by 2030.@@@The SDGs will continue to be a guiding light that shapes national policies, budgets, institutions.@@@Governments and sector strategies.@@@The Kingdom of Eswatini stands with the rest of the world in committing to accelerating progress in the implementation of the United Nations targets in the remaining seven years.@@@The year 2023 is a turning point for the country, as we hope to break through to a better future for all.@@@Let me take this opportunity to wish all participants successful deliberations.@@@May Almighty God bless us all.@@@From this rostrum at the United Nations.@@@I would like, first, to offer our most heartfelt condolence s to the Governments of the Kingdom of Morocco and Libya, and to express our feelings of fraternal solidarity with the peoples of those two friendly countries.@@@I would like to congratulate Mr. Dennis Francis, from Trinidad and Tobago, for his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session.@@@I wish him much success during his term.@@@I would also like to congratulate his predecessor.@@@Mr. Csaba Korosi of Hungary, for the results achieved during his presidency.@@@I also congratulate Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on his achievements in promoting peace and development in the world.@@@The speakers who preceded me at this rostrum presented important analyses and observations on current challenges and the international scenario.@@@Therefore.@@@I will focus on concrete actions that, in my view, are expected from us — the United Nations.@@@For Guinea-Bissau, the best response to the challenges that confront the international community includes strengthening multilateralism and international cooperation.@@@In our view, multilateralism is an indispensable instrument and a moral imperative if we wish to build, together, a world of solidarity and well-being for all.@@@To that end, we welcome the choice and significance of the theme for this session of the General Assembly, which stresses the importance of global trust and solidarity, prosperity, progress and sustainability for all.@@@We are expected to take coordinated actions to implement our decisions, such as the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and the African Union’s Agenda 2063:@@@The Africa We Want, to ensure development financing and to collectively protect and improve our planet.@@@To that end, we must comply with the Paris Agreement and the agreement reached at the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change agreements, including the loss and damage fund for vulnerable countries, particularly island nations such as my country.@@@Guinea-Bissau.@@@We must introduce the changes required in the international peace and security architecture and in the world financial system to enable them to respond to the current international scenario.@@@Security Council reform, which has long been deemed as necessary, must consider the position of the African Union in order to ensure a realistic and fairer representation consistent with the increasingly preponderant role of Africa in building and maintaining balance in the world.@@@Since I became President of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau in 2020, we have focused on dialogue, peace-building and political stability, as well as social and economic development in our country and in the West Africa subregion and beyond.@@@Those principles also guided us during our term as Chairman of the Conference of Heads of State and Government of the Economic Community of West African States, which we accepted with determination and a heightened sense of responsibility, and which ended last July.@@@To that end, we wish to reiterate our great concern about the recurrence of coup d’etats and reversals in democracy and the rule of law in some countries in our subregion, in flagrant violation of the populations’ freedom of choice as expressed through ballot boxes.@@@Despite the harmful effects of the prolonged embargo imposed on the people of Cuba, our sister nation has always supported and continues to support the countries of Africa.@@@We reiterate our appeal for an end to that unjust and irrational embargo, which is an obstacle to the fulfilment of the legitimate aspirations of the Cuban people.@@@The same is true for our brothers and sisters in Venezuela, whom we must also not forget and to whom we must show our solidarity.@@@As you know, it has been a year since I took office as Chair of the African Leaders Malaria Alliance.@@@As Heads of State and Government, we continue, in Africa, to give priority to the struggle against malaria.@@@As a result of that effort, more than 1.5 billion cases of malaria have been avoided and 10.5 million lives have been saved in Africa since 2000.@@@I call on Africa and the international community to take action.@@@If we wish to achieve our global goals for 2030 of ending malaria epidemics and achieving universal health coverage, we must act now.@@@This year, the people of the Republic of Guinea-@@@Bissau are celebrating 50 years of existence as an 
independent and sovereign State.@@@Thus, as an emissary of the nation of Guinea-Bissau.@@@I am thankful for the extraordinary aid provided by the former Soviet Union, the Republic of Guinea-Conakry.@@@Cuba.@@@Algeria.@@@Morocco.@@@Sweden and other countries to our struggle for liberation, as well as the United Nations in its historic visit to our liberated regions, confirming the existence of effective political, administrative and military control.@@@On this solemn occasion of 50 years of independence, the people of the Republic of Guinea-@@@Bissau will strengthen their determination and energy to consolidate national unity and mobilize even more, as enshrined in the national anthem of Guinea-Bissau, to build peace and progress in our everlasting homeland.@@@At this historic juncture in the history of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, and before I finish my remarks.@@@I would like to reaffirm, on behalf of our Government and the people of Guinea-Bissau, from this rostrum and before the world, our continuous engagement and availability to continue to work with the United Nations and to cooperate with all friendly Governments and peoples for global peace and development and to protect our planet.@@@Ghana presents its compliments to the President and congratulates him on his election to preside over the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session.@@@Ghana also uses this — the greatest of all platforms — to express the deep condolences and sympathies of its Government and its people to the Governments and the peoples of Morocco and Libya over the recent tragic events that have engulfed their countries.@@@I do not need to employ any hyperbole or find fancy words to state the reality of the situation that humankind currently faces.@@@Our world is not a happy place today.@@@Wherever we look and to whichever area of our lives we turn our attention, there is unhappiness, distrust and a loss of confidence in the structures that have guided the governance of the world since the end of the Second World War, nearly eight decades ago.@@@The theme chosen for the seventy-eighth session is “Rebuilding trust and reigniting global solidarity: accelerating action on the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals towards peace.@@@prosperity, progress and sustainability for all”.@@@The choice of that theme implies that there is a general acknowledgement that things are not what they should be in our world.@@@The mutual trust among nations, which is required to ensure harmony, has considerably diminished.@@@The cohesion that we need to build the peace and prosperity of our societies is disintegrating and nearing Cold War lows.@@@We do not seem to have any common values on which we can all agree, or common goals to which we all aspire.@@@The fault lines are not just between the poor and the rich, the South and the North, or the developed and the developing countries.@@@Even within well-established and rich countries, the tensions over trade, climate, political boundaries and geopolitical spheres of influence are palpable.@@@Long- held definitions are being challenged, sacred truths and beliefs are being questioned or discarded outright and, in some instances, the deliberate peddling of blatant untruths has become acceptable.@@@The United Nations Organization, under whose auspices we, the nations of the world, are gathered for the annual review of the world, was established in the belief that our common humanity would be the overriding consideration in dealing with the problems that would invariably arise when we deal with one another.@@@There is no doubt that the Organization has achieved a great deal in its 78 years of existence, of which we can all be justifiably proud.@@@But it is also true that the reluctance of the nations that were the major Powers at the time of its founding to agree to any reform to reflect current realities has led to the undermining of the credibility of the United Nations and some of its organs, in particular the Security Council.@@@Ghana is currently serving out the second year of its two-year term as a non-permanent member of the Security Council.@@@That is the fourth time that we have had the privilege of serving on the Council in the 66 years since we joined the United Nations, as the first post-colonial African nation to do so.@@@It has been a sad and disappointing experience for us.@@@We have witnessed at first hand, over and over again, that the great Powers of the United Nations might be preaching democracy, fairness and justice around the world, but they are happy to practice the opposite here at the United Nations, prioritizing parochial interests over those of humankind.@@@In 2017, the first time I addressed the General Assembly as President of my country (see A/72/PV.11).@@@I spoke at length on the need for reform of the United Nations and of the Security Council in particular.@@@I said then that the urgent need to reform the Organization had been talked about and scheduled for a long time, but that somehow we had never found the courage and the will to execute it.@@@I said then that Ghana supports United Nations reform, especially of the Security Council, as set out in the African Common Position on Security Council Reform based on the Ezulwini Consensus.@@@I said then that the time was long overdue to correct the long-standing injustice that the current structure and composition of the Security Council represent for the nations of Africa.@@@After serving on the Council at this difficult time in the world, our views on the need for reform have been even more strongly reaffirmed.@@@We cannot continue to preach democracy, equality and good governance around the globe, and we cannot insist on peace and justice in the world, when our global Organization is seen by the majority of its Members and the people of the world as being hampered by an unjust and unfair structure.@@@The Assembly has quite properly chosen the rebuilding of trust as critical for restoring stability and prosperity to our world.@@@We cannot rebuild such trust when the Organization that should bring us together is seen by many as helping to perpetuate an unfair world order, which is reinforced by an inequitable, dysfunctional global financial architecture.@@@For the past year and a half, a full-scale war has been waged in the centre of Europe.@@@The United Nations appears unwilling or unable to influence the events taking place in Ukraine.@@@Ghana has sat on the Security Council throughout that period and can testify that the global solidarity we seek to reignite under the umbrella of the United Nations will happen only if, and when, it suits those who wield the mighty power of the veto.@@@And, at the moment, there is nothing to show that those countries have any interest or inclination to make that happen.@@@Ghana still believes that the Organization provides the best vehicle for the world to manage its hydra-headed problems, but it can function effectively and meet our expectations only when we reform the pillars upon which it rests.@@@Anything short of that will continue to undermine its credibility.@@@I do not refer to the events in Ukraine and seek to pretend to ignore the tragic events in my own neighbourhood of West Africa and the Sahel.@@@Instability in the Sahel and widespread terrorist activities have put West African countries under severe political pressure and economic strain.@@@Several countries in the region 
have lost vast stretches of territory to the rampaging terrorists.@@@Coups d’etat have re-emerged as what some mistakenly hoped would be the solution to the threats that confront their nations.@@@We in the West African region are trying as best as we can, under the very trying conditions we face, to deal with the situation.@@@We are convinced that the conflicts that continue to plague our continent, and our region in particular, would be more satisfactorily resolved if the international community were to support, and not undermine, the efforts of our regional and continental organizations to deal with them.@@@Africans fought and died in the Second World War in defence of Europe and its allies and reset the world towards the path of peace and prosperity that their nations and citizens have enjoyed for decades now.@@@It is surely time for the world to reciprocate in our time of need.@@@We in Ghana are holding firm to our belief in democracy as the best route to building the prosperous nation that is our aim.@@@It is true that the economic dividends that many of our citizens justifiably expected from the democratic process have not come as fast as had been anticipated, but we are determined to hold fast to the course because we believe that ultimately it will succeed in delivering freedom and prosperity for the mass of our people.@@@We are also obliged to countenance, for the first time in recent human history, not just the questioning of democracy and a deliberate campaign of disinformation against democracy but also the propagation of authoritarian rule as a faster route to economic advancement.@@@The belief of young people in democracy as the governance model that is best suited to building peace and prosperity in our society is under systematic attack.@@@The economic impact of the coronavirus disease pandemic and the impact of the war in Ukraine have only added to the pressure and the anxiety of our young people.@@@We can certainly also do without having to spend the huge amounts of money we currently spend on security, at our northern borders in particular.@@@At this time, unhappily, we feel no sense of the international solidarity that we believe we should receive.@@@It is surely in the interests of the whole world that West Africa should be peaceful and prosperous.@@@We want our young people to be part of a peaceful and prosperous West Africa, rather than part of the thousands who arrive at an unwelcoming Europe after perilous journeys across the Sahara and the Mediterranean Sea.@@@We do not seek to shirk any responsibility for the problems we face that are of our own making, and it bears repeating that we are not craving for sympathy and do not want to be a scar on anybody’s conscience.@@@But we cannot — and the world should not — pretend that the current economic and social conditions of Africa have nothing to do with the historical injustices that have fashioned the structures of the world.@@@It is time to acknowledge openly that much of Europe and the United States was built from the vast wealth harvested from the sweat, tears, blood and horrors of the transatlantic slave trade and the centuries of colonial exploitation.@@@Maybe we should also admit that it cannot be easy to build confident and prosperous societies from nations that for centuries had their natural resources looted and their peoples traded as commodities.@@@For centuries, the world has been unwilling and unable to confront the realities of the consequences of the slave trade, but that is changing gradually, and it is time to bring the subject of reparations firmly to the fore.@@@Granted that current generations are not the ones that engaged in the slave trade; however, that grand inhuman enterprise was State-sponsored and deliberate, and its benefits are clearly interwoven with the current economic architecture of the nations that designed and executed it.@@@Reparations must be paid for the slave trade.@@@No amount of money will ever make up for the horrors, but it would make the point that evil was perpetrated, that millions of productive Africans were snatched from the embrace of their continent and put to work in the Americas and the Caribbean without compensation for their labour.@@@If there is any hesitation in some minds about the paying of reparations, it is worth considering the fact that, when slavery was abolished, the slave owners were compensated for the loss of the slaves, because the enslaved human beings were labelled as property, deemed to be commodities.@@@Surely, that is a matter that the world must confront and can no longer ignore.@@@The African Union has authorized Ghana to hold a global conference on the issue in Accra in November.@@@It is probably also the time to return to that vexed subject of illicit financial flows out of the continent of Africa.@@@I refer to the report of the panel chaired by the highly respected former South African President.@@@Thabo Mbeki, on the illicit flow of funds from Africa, which states that Africa is losing more than $88 billion annually through illicit financial outflows.@@@Yes, those monies too must be returned to the continent.@@@It is 
difficult to understand why the recipient countries are comfortable about retaining such funds and are happy to call those countries from which the monies are taken as corrupt.@@@I believe that a joint task force of the African Union Commission and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development secretariat, under the auspices of the United Nations, should be charged with finding ways of stopping the damaging outflows.@@@Before the pandemic, as in many other parts of the world, we were making progress with the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and we had good reason to believe we would achieve the 2030 target.@@@Today the picture we have of our performance is not very bright.@@@Most of the 21 targets designated for achievement by 2020 have not been met, and we are not on track to achieve many other targets by 2030.@@@According to The Sustainable Development Goals Report 2023, just 12 per cent of the SDG targets are on track to be achieved.@@@Progress on 50 per cent of the targets is weak.@@@The most disappointing part is that we have stalled or retrogressed with respect more than 30 per cent of the targets.@@@We need to accelerate action on the entire project.@@@It is within our capacity to turn things around.@@@A good start would be to make the needed changes to the structures of our Organization; then, we can rebuild trust and reignite global solidarity.@@@The convening of the seventy-eighth session of the General Assembly affords me the opportunity to share with the States Members of our Organization the vision and major concerns of my country, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with respect to the current global challenges facing us.@@@Having said that.@@@I wish to preface my remarks by congratulating His Excellency Mr. Dennis Francis on his election to the presidency of the Assembly and assuring all the members of his Bureau of the support of my country as they discharge the noble mission conferred on them by our institution.@@@I would be remiss if I did not also thank the outgoing President.@@@Mr. Csaba Korosi, for his farsighted leadership and dedication, which contributed to moving forward our discussions and to finding concerted solutions.@@@I wish also to extend my gratitude to Mr. Antonio Guterres, the Secretary-General, for his active and ongoing commitment to international peace and security.@@@As our session unfolds here in New York, the people of Morocco are still mourning the victims and nursing their wounds following the powerful earthquakes that occurred during the night of Friday.@@@8 September, to Saturday.@@@9 September, causing the deaths of more than 3.000 Moroccans and wounding at least 5.000, and destroying several cities and areas of the Kingdom.@@@Furthermore, the Libyan people have not yet recovered from the trauma of the flooding that claimed the lives of more than 20.000 people and caused major damage on Sunday.@@@10 September.@@@The people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo welcomes the mobilization of the international community to provide assistance to the kindred peoples of the Kingdom of Morocco and of Libya.@@@We convey to them our full compassion and solidarity and wish a speedy recovery to all those wounded in those two natural disasters.@@@But beyond deploring those natural disasters, the current session of the General Assembly is taking place at an exceptional period of our history in which the world faces serious situations that threaten the very existence of human beings.@@@The war in Ukraine has caused a food crisis marked by skyrocketing prices and shortages of basic goods; the exacerbation of the effects of climate change; and armed conflicts that continue to erupt in various places.@@@Those mutually reinforcing crises pose a challenge to the multilateral system and to international cooperation.@@@And yet what all peoples of the world want and have always wanted is the maintenance of international peace and security, the guaranteeing of justice and human rights, the prioritization of social progress and the creation of the best possible living conditions.@@@Those goals therefore need to remain at the centre of our collective action, in the context of a truly multilateral and inclusive approach.@@@We are called upon to work together with an eye to responding to those challenges, which are existential in scope.@@@It is for that fundamental reason that I welcome the relevance of the theme of this year’s session, entitled “Rebuilding trust and reigniting global solidarity: accelerating action on the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals towards peace, prosperity, progress and sustainability for all”.@@@That theme places the values of solidarity and of trust at the forefront of the factors for recovery and for accelerating solutions to closely intertwined global challenges in order to move forward peace, security and sustainable development.@@@Those two values find their full expression in the context of the crises that we are facing today.@@@In that regard, it is vital to recall that at the halfway point towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, in 2023, given the combined effect of climate disasters, recurrent conflicts, the economic recession and the persistent after-effects of the coronavirus disease pandemic, inequality and poverty have worsened.@@@Hunger and malnutrition are on the rise; humanitarian needs and the displacement of populations have reached record levels; and climate and environmental disasters have brought the world face to face with a very serious systemic existential threat.@@@It is clear that in order to tackle those scourges, which pose a genuine threat to international peace and security and represent a major obstacle to the prosperity and progress of nations, joining forces and taking a multilateral approach based on mutual trust and solidarity are major and indispensable steps.@@@The maintenance of international peace and security constitutes the foundation of and the main objective underpinning the creation of the United Nations.@@@Its achievement requires greater determination and commitment on the part of all given the current threats to peace and security in the world.@@@African peoples often do not understand the equivocal attitude, policy of double standards, ambiguities and procrastination we see on the part of our Organization, especially of its Security Council, in certain political and security crises that are raging in Africa and sometimes have been for decades.@@@That is the case, notably, of the forgotten crisis of Western Sahara, which has riven apart two kindred countries.@@@Algeria and the Kingdom of Morocco, and which has dragged on for several decades.@@@That is also the case of Mozambique, the victim of deadly terrorist attacks for roughly a decade now in the province of Cabo Delgado.@@@In West Africa, in the Sahelo-Saharan region.@@@United Nations troops are withdrawing, leaving behind the memory of what they did not achieve, despite the fact that they had embodied all of the hopes of the peoples of the countries concerned for liberation from the yoke of jihadism.@@@The Republic of the Sudan is no exception.@@@The Sudan is mired in a deadly civil war that since last year has pitted military personnel loyal to President Abdel-@@@Fattah Al-Burhan against the Rapid Support Forces commanded by General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo.@@@Although the war has already caused many deaths and much material damage, the international community is virtually indifferent to the Sudanese tragedy.@@@This is also the place to broach a question of paramount importance to the Democratic Republic of Congo and to building peace in our region.@@@I refer here to the withdrawal of the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO).@@@Following a United Nations presence of more than two decades, it is time for my country to fully take its destiny in hand and to become the main protagonist of its own stability.@@@We are grateful to the international community and to the United Nations for their support and their partnership, but we are also aware that the phased withdrawal of MONUSCO is a necessary stage to consolidate the progress that we have already achieved.@@@Nonetheless, it should be deplored that the peacekeeping missions that have been deployed in various forms for 25 years in the Democratic Republic of the Congo have not been able to stop the uprisings and armed conflicts that are tearing apart the country and the Great Lakes region or to protect civilian populations.@@@So is the phased, responsible and sustainable withdrawal of MONUSCO, which was announced in 2018 and whose transition plan was adopted in 2021, now an anachronism given the changing political, security and social contingencies?@@@It is thus illusory and counterproductive to continue to cling to maintaining MONUSCO to re-establish peace in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to stabilize it.@@@Furthermore, the accelerated withdrawal of MONUSCO is absolutely necessary to ease the tensions between the Mission and our citizens.@@@It is time for my country to explore fresh avenues for strategic cooperation with the United Nations that are more adapted to our current realities.@@@That is why, in my capacity as constitutional guarantor of my country’s territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence, and of the good conduct of our nation and the well-being of my compatriots.@@@I have instructed the Government of the Republic to begin discussions with the United Nations authorities to 
ensure an accelerated withdrawal of MONUSCO from the Democratic Republic of the Congo by moving up the deadline for the withdrawal from December 2024 to December 2023.@@@That is the reasoning underpinning the current approach of our Government, which addressed a letter to the President of the Security Council dated 1 September 2023 asking for the accelerated withdrawal of MONUSCO (see S/2023/648).@@@In addition to asking for the accelerated withdrawal of MONUSCO, the Democratic Republic of the Congo reiterates its request to the Security Council to sanction all physical and legal persons acknowledged to be perpetrators, co-perpetrators or accomplices, both material and intellectual, of war crimes and crimes against humanity and serious violations of human rights, international law and the Charter of the United Nations on Congolese territory.@@@It is unjust and unacceptable that persons deemed responsible for the serious crimes mentioned in various reports of United Nations experts on the security situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo should continue to enjoy impunity with complete silence on the part of our Organization and its Member States, even though the latter have cited the combat against impunity as one of their main priorities in the areas of internal and external governance.@@@In that regard, the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo warmly welcomes the sanctions recently imposed by the Government of the United States on Rwanda for its support for the Mouvement du 23 mars terrorist group and on one of its senior officials involved in the criminal undertakings in the Congo.@@@Members will recall that that terrorist group, which is a proxy for Rwanda, has not honoured any of the commitments entered into by the Heads of State of the region in the context of the Luanda and Nairobi processes.@@@Indeed, not only have they not left the positions they had seized, but they also continue to massacre our civilian populations and to refuse cantonment and pre-cantonment, demanding a dialogue that will never be granted to them.@@@The Democratic Republic of the Congo hopes that other States will follow the praiseworthy example set by the United States of America in supporting the common struggle against impunity and ensuring the triumph of the ideals of justice and solidarity among peoples.@@@The Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo expects the Security Council to focus in particular on its request and to constructively manage the delicate and laborious process of crafting peace in our country.@@@Another challenge exists that is of the utmost concern to all the nations of the world: global warming.@@@I need hardly recall that the rising temperature over several decades has affected all humankind and is of concern to us all.@@@I am compelled to note here that despite the polluters’ good-faith proclamations in favour of stopping greenhouse-gas emissions; the many forums convened all over the world to stem that scourge, including the 27 Conferences of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COPs); and the many resolutions and recommendations adopted at the various meetings, the warming of our planet is far from being limited to the target of 1.5°C.@@@On the contrary, at COP 27, held in Sharm El- Sheikh.@@@Egypt, this year, concerns were expressed about the trend of rising temperatures.@@@That not very reassuring acknowledgment no doubt calls for us to revisit the approaches and policies that we have adopted.@@@In that context, the African Climate Summit, which was just held in Nairobi from 4 to 7 September under the joint leadership of the African Union and the Republic of Kenya, was a welcome and timely initiative that reflects Africa’s determination to participate actively in addressing that vital question and to be a key and influential player in the process of devising solutions to global warming and to ensuring greener and more responsible economies in future.@@@The Africans emerged from the Summit with a set of shared specifications contained in the Nairobi Declaration, which are aimed at ensuring a reform of the international financial architecture so as to ensure greater fairness; restructuring and debt alleviation for their countries; the local processing of their products; and the establishment of a carbon tax regime, including a tax on the trade in fossil fuels and on maritime and air transport.@@@They also reminded rich polluters of the commitment they undertook in 2009 but have yet to honour of providing $100 billion in climate financing.@@@The Democratic Republic of the Congo calls on the United Nations and the international community as a whole to pay particular attention to the legitimate claims of Africa.@@@In that context, my country calls for the creation of a fair carbon market and incentive 
pricing while strengthening the effectiveness of climate financing.@@@We hope to see the rapid operationalization of article 6 of the Paris Agreement and support the idea of mutually beneficial partnerships between the State and the private sector.@@@In the same vein, the Democratic Republic of the Congo reiterates its full readiness to cooperate with all stakeholders, public and private alike, in order to make the most of its strategic minerals.@@@It has undertaken bold commitments, including dedicating 30 per cent of its national territory to the preservation of biodiversity and submitting a nationally determined contribution that includes mitigation measures focused on four priority sectors: agriculture, forestry, energy and technology transfer, as well as adaptation measures.@@@Multilateralism and respect for a global rules-based system has underpinned peace, security, health and prosperity in large parts of the world for the past 78 years.@@@The United Nations embodies those principles and remains a key protagonist in addressing contemporary existential threats, be they the current food crisis, climate change, terrorism, pandemics or nuclear proliferation.@@@None of those critical global threats can be resolved by nations acting alone, no matter how powerful they may be.@@@All that requires multilateral cooperation.@@@To retain the trust of the international community, the United Nations must show that it is capable of adapting to the present and of effectively shouldering its responsibilities in tackling today’s challenges.@@@In order to provide a new impetus to multilateralism, a reform of the Charter of the United Nations on key points, including the Security Council, the veto.@@@Chapter VII and the use of force, is absolutely necessary but will not be sufficient.@@@We have a lot of work to do.@@@Coordination and cooperation among the various institutions and agencies of the United Nations are imperfect.@@@Global challenges are tackled several times over in various forums from different and contradictory perspectives, while other problems are not addressed at all, with each international bureaucracy aiming to preserve itself.@@@In that regard, the urgent and unremitting request of my country and of Africa as a whole is to expand the Security Council, as a guiding decision-making organ of the United Nations, in such a way as to include therein two representatives of the African continent as permanent members in order to ensure fair and representative geographical representation — hence the relevance and necessity of reforming our 78-year-old Organization, which is somewhat hobbled in the face of current changes and international trends, so as to make it more inclusive in its composition and in its decision-making process, which from now on will have to pay heed to Africa’s voice.@@@Before I conclude, from this rostrum let me to return to the issue of violence against women in the context of war and armed conflict.@@@It is no secret that the Democratic Republic of the Congo is one of the African States where sexual violence against women is the most disturbing, due in particular to decades of armed conflict.@@@In order to alleviate the suffering of women who are victims of conflict-related violence and to compensate them in some small way for the harm caused to them, my country set up specific institutional mechanisms, including the National Fund for the Reparation of Victims of Conflict-related Sexual Violence and Victims of Crimes against the Peace and Security of Humankind, established in December 2022.@@@As an extension of such initiatives to protect and promote women, the Democratic Republic of the Congo is working tirelessly to change the way in which men see women, in particular by eliminating societal structures that create barriers to women’s advancement, as well as the power dynamics that underpin male-female relations.@@@The skills and resources available to women are insufficient on their own to change their situation.@@@It is also essential to change the social dynamics within couples, families and communities.@@@That is the essence of the project to promote positive masculinity that I initiated at the beginning of my term at the head of the African Union.@@@In conclusion.@@@I would like to once again affirm that, at the end of this year, general elections will be held in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in elected institutions down to the local level.@@@To ensure their success, all parties involved are actively mobilizing.@@@The Independent National Electoral Commission has already convened the electorate and published the lists of candidates for the national and provincial legislative elections and the municipal elections.@@@Measures have been taken to ensure the transparency, inclusiveness, equality of opportunity and credibility of the upcoming elections.@@@Invitations have already been extended to international institutions and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) specializing in that area to send their electoral observation missions to support the 
process and help the Congolese State to consolidate its fledgling democracy.@@@The United Nations is also invited to play an important role in that through its specialized agencies.@@@The Congolese Government would like to thank the invited institutions and NGOs that are already hard at work.@@@The Democratic Republic of the Congo remains convinced that the United Nations continues to be the most appropriate forum for discussing the future of our planet and relations among peoples and States.@@@Following the holding of peaceful democratic elections in Zimbabwe.@@@I make an urgent appeal to the United Nations to do its utmost to ensure the immediate lifting of sanctions against the Republic of Zimbabwe and its people.@@@However, in order to carry out its difficult and delicate tasks effectively and merit the trust of all, the United Nations must embody the values of justice, equity and solidarity and represent all in our cultural, political, economic and social diversity.@@@That is the essence of its reform that Africans keep bringing up, and of the fight that we must all wage.@@@We are meeting at a critical moment.@@@Political, economic and cultural divisions are deepening before our eyes.@@@Conflicts, instability and civil unrest are erupting around the globe.@@@Disruption of the rules-based international order threatens the world we all know and cherish.@@@The time for decisive action is now.@@@We must rise to the challenges and work together to preserve peace, prosperity and stability, to safeguard the rules-based order, democracy and the universality of human rights, to save our home, planet Earth, from the effects of disastrous climate change and to fight hard against global poverty and inequality.@@@That will certainly not be easy.@@@Global trust will have to be restored, the Sustainable Development Goals implemented, and a meaningful Pact for the Future negotiated and signed.@@@I am standing here to express my great concern about the devastating impact of climate change and to share the Lithuanian experience.@@@Today green transformation is no longer a matter of choice.@@@We need decisive action to keep the goals and spirit of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change alive.@@@Lithuania is resolutely committed to preventing, minimizing and addressing climate change.@@@We aim to achieve a 70 per cent reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions by 2030 and become climate-neutral in 2050.@@@Renewable energy will play the central role in our strategy.@@@Our ambition is to turn Lithuania from a net importer of electricity into a self-sufficient green-energy producer by 2030.@@@The development of solar energy, as well as onshore and offshore wind parks, should substantially increase our installed capacity for renewable electricity generation.@@@There can be no sustainable development in the midst of a war.@@@Wherever we look — Europe.@@@Asia.@@@Africa or the Americas — peace is an all-important condition for humankind to thrive and to create.@@@An old-style colonial war is back in Europe.@@@Russia’s aggression against Ukraine is aggravating the global situation across many areas, such as food and energy security, climate, finance, global health and migration.@@@Established international norms and the entire vision of an open and cooperative world order are currently being held hostage to Russia’s imperialist ambitions.@@@The very framework of the multilateral cooperation that sustained peace, stability and prosperity in the post-Cold War era is being threatened.@@@The integrity of 
the Charter of the United Nations and the rules-based international system is being put at serious risk.@@@The international community can no longer allow Russia to manipulate and abuse global rules.@@@Its numerous crimes, such as the wholesale destruction of Ukrainian cities and towns, the murder of thousands of innocent civilians and the displacement of millions more, have brought disgrace on the Security Council, where Russia still sits as a permanent member with the power of the veto.@@@The international community should put more pressure on Russia to stop its deliberate attacks on Ukrainian civilians and civilian infrastructure.@@@The unprecedented ecological catastrophe caused by the destruction of the Kakhovka dam should not be replicated in new and even more dangerous forms.@@@That war of aggression must stop, with an immediate, complete and unconditional withdrawal of troops and military equipment from Ukrainian territory.@@@And what I mean by that is Ukraine’s entire territory, within its internationally recognized borders and territorial waters as of 1991.@@@Lithuania strongly endorses President Zelenskyy’s peace formula.@@@It is a robust foundation for achieving peace, aligned with the universal principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence.@@@Meanwhile.@@@Lithuania calls on all the States Members of the United Nations to provide substantial humanitarian, military, economic and diplomatic assistance to Ukraine.@@@As we work for sustainable peace, we should ensure the accountability of those responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity.@@@While contemplating the issue of justice, we should also address the actions of the regime in Belarus, which is participating in this war of aggression by providing military assistance and facilitating the offensive from its territory.@@@Specifically, we should all support Ukraine’s efforts in the International Court of Justice and endorse the Court’s provisional measures ordering Russia to immediately cease its military action in the territory of Ukraine.@@@Another institution, the International Criminal Court (ICC), is playing a crucial role in prosecuting war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity in Ukraine.@@@Lithuania supports the arrest warrants issued by the ICC for Russia’s President and Children’s Rights Commissioner, which represent a promising step towards accountability for targeting children in military conflict.@@@Bringing back the Ukrainian children forcibly deported to Russia and Belarus is a necessary next step.@@@The initiative to persecute sexual crimes perpetrated by Russian forces in Ukraine also deserves our united support.@@@Lithuania commends the unwavering dedication of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict in addressing that critical issue.@@@What is still lacking is a tribunal specifically designed to prosecute the very crime of aggression committed by Russia’s top political and military leadership.@@@Lithuania calls for the establishment of such an international tribunal, supported by a General Assembly resolution.@@@Failure to do so will mean further damage to the credibility of the entire global justice system.@@@From the very beginning.@@@Russia’s aggression against Ukraine has been a truly global issue.@@@It affects global food security as well as nuclear safety.@@@Russia is currently holding the world hostage by blocking Ukrainian grain exports, looting the occupied Ukrainian territories and devastating local agricultural infrastructure.@@@Unilateral actions such as Russia’s withdrawal from the Black Sea Grain Initiative, endangering at least 82 countries, with 350 million people currently on the food-insecurity front lines, should be universally condemned.@@@But the solution is not lifting the sanctions on Russia.@@@To reinforce vulnerable economies, we must search for geopolitical solutions.@@@One possibility could be the opening of more solidarity lanes by offering alternative transportation for Ukrainian food products, for example, through trusted Baltic Sea ports.@@@The availability of local food production and fertilizer in vulnerable regions could also be boosted by international support.@@@Looking into the issue of nuclear safety.@@@Lithuania expects more active cooperation from Russia in protecting the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant, in accordance with the recommendations of the International Atomic Energy Agency.@@@We are also following Russia’s recent decisions on arms control with the greatest concern.@@@Last year Russia broke the emerging consensus at the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.@@@Later.@@@Belarus announced an agreement to deploy Russia’s nuclear weapons on its territory, which goes against the international commitments under the Treaty.@@@Finally.@@@Russia officially announced its withdrawal from the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe.@@@That means it is preparing for more war — not to settle for peace.@@@The only way for us to turn back the tide of destabilization that threatens us all is to join forces in building a better world.@@@We need a collective effort to rebuild trust among nations.@@@Violations of international law and universal human rights cannot be normalized.@@@Neither justice nor peace is free.@@@We must stand for peace.@@@We must stand for justice.@@@Accountability and the rules-based international order will be vital to forging a world that is fair and secure.@@@That is our responsibility to future generations.@@@Today I expect the Assembly to remain steadfast in its condemnation of all kinds of aggression that clearly violate the Charter of the United Nations.@@@However, condemning them is not enough.@@@Decisive action must be taken.@@@The politics of fear and coercion on a global scale must be stopped once and for all.@@@We must resolutely defend the equality of sovereign nations, both large and small.@@@We must remain true to the Charter’s fundamental principles, including respect for international law and arms control.@@@Those principles must guide our path forward.@@@Each and every nation is important.@@@We must stand together against the power of fear.@@@Together we can change the world.@@@I congratulate His Excellency Mr. Dennis Francis on assuming the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session.@@@We are delighted that a fellow member of the Forum of Small States has been elected to the highest office in the General Assembly.@@@I also thank His Excellency Mr. Csaba Korosi for his adept stewardship of the seventy-seventh session during a very challenging year.@@@Our world is a troubled place.@@@The coronavirus disease pandemic was a global test of equity, governance and preparedness, but, quite frankly, the world came up short.@@@We are still dealing with its sequelae — in health care and education and the long-term impact on the world economy and global solidarity.@@@Recent natural disasters, in fact, underline our common vulnerability as nations on the same planet.@@@Nature is a force that respects no borders.@@@Our hearts go out to the victims of the earthquakes in Morocco and Türkiye and the floods in Libya.@@@There are looming food and water crises, and if we miss our climate change targets, we will heap even more misery upon ourselves and on future generations.@@@Beyond the devastation caused by pandemics and natural disasters, we have created purely human- made tragedies, as well.@@@The Russia-Ukraine conflict continues to rage on.@@@It is a full-frontal assault on 
the Charter of the United Nations and a flagrant violation of international law.@@@Global food insecurity has been aggravated by the war in Ukraine, as well as by climate change, which will add to inflationary pressures everywhere.@@@In the Association of Southeast Asian Nations — in my part of the world — the violent coup in Myanmar has deprived the people of Myanmar of the peace and development that they so need and richly deserve.@@@Our hearts go out to our brothers and sisters in Myanmar.@@@That perfect storm is aggravated by political dysfunction almost everywhere — fractious hyper-polarized domestic politics, disillusionment with globalization and multilateralism and a lack of strategic trust among countries, especially the superpowers.@@@That dysfunction hobbles our ability to deal with planetary crises that go beyond the ability of any single superpower or even blocs of countries to overcome.@@@In fact, all countries need to work together to build coherent and concrete multilateral solutions.@@@Singapore is a tiny, vulnerable and open island city-State, and we therefore have to strongly support the United Nations and the indispensable rules-based multilateral system.@@@It provides a stable framework for us to thrive, exercise our autonomy and chart our own future for our own people.@@@I was glad to see the urgent focus on those issues during this year’s high-level week.@@@The Sustainable Development Goals Summit has shown that we have fallen behind our targets.@@@The Climate Ambition Summit, the three high-level meetings on health and the preparatory meeting for the Summit of the Future have helped us to recalibrate the multilateral system.@@@I would like to put forward three principles that should guide our collective efforts to make the multilateral system more resilient and ready for the future.@@@First, we should reaffirm our commitment to building a multilateral system that reflects our enlightened long-term interests as a global community.@@@Unfortunately, the world today is marked by even sharper geopolitical rivalry.@@@Free trade is in retreat, and supply chains are being fragmented.@@@That unravels the gains that we have painstakingly made over many decades by competing and contributing to a common global technology stack.@@@We must avoid turning competition into a zero-sum game.@@@Whether we are addressing climate change, outer space or technology standards, it is important for all countries to balance their national interests with the collective long-term interests of our global community.@@@That means that Member States should work constructively and in good faith within the multilateral framework, keeping our enlightened common interests in mind.@@@The need for compromise and mutual understanding is a feature — not a bug — of the multilateral system.@@@And in the light of the planetary challenges we face, there is no winner who can take all.
Secondly.@@@Member States should accept and respect the diversity of experiences, systems, concepts and ideas within the multilateral system.@@@This is born out of our rich tapestry of cultures, religions and social norms.@@@We must recognize that there is no one-size-fits-all template for how a country should organize itself.@@@No one has a monopoly on culture or wisdom, and we should resist the arrogant temptation to remake others in our own image.@@@The rich diversity of peoples and nations everywhere can in fact lead to a fruitful cross-fertilization of ideas and the development of even more policy options to deal with the many challenges we face.@@@The United Nations is an indispensable platform in which countries can share our experiences in areas from sustainable development to human rights and in which we can learn from one another.@@@The Summit of the Future gives us an opportunity to strengthen the multilateral system by taking into account diverse points of view and building a common framework for our future.@@@Thirdly, in the midst of the digital revolution and especially the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), we must not only prepare for the risks of those technologies but also distribute their benefits more fairly.@@@In the past year, generative AI such as ChatGPT has captured the popular imagination.@@@But we are actually already on the verge of the next stage: AI agents with the ability to negotiate and transact with each other and humans, and often we will not be able to tell the difference.@@@That has profound implications on all our societies, our politics and economies everywhere.@@@And autonomous weapons systems without human fingers on the triggers are already with us — witness the wars around us.@@@As Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said at the opening of the General Assembly this week.@@@“Generative artificial intelligence holds much promise, but it may also lead us to cross a Rubicon and into more danger than we can control.”@@@(A/78/ PV.4, p. 5)
That is especially so the theatre of war and peace.@@@Al will fundamentally disrupt our assumptions on military doctrine and strategic deterrence.@@@For example, the speed at which Al-enabled weapons systems can be 
almost instantaneously deployed and triggered will dramatically reduce decision times for our leaders.@@@There will be many occasions when humans may not even be in the firing loop — but we will be on the firing line.@@@That would inevitably heighten the risks of unintended conflicts or the escalation of conflicts.@@@During the Cold War, the sense of mutually assured destruction imposed mutual restraint — although we now know that there were in fact several close shaves.@@@That spectre of nuclear escalation has not disappeared.@@@Yet the advent of artificial intelligence in conflict situations has actually increased the risks exponentially.@@@We therefore must start an inclusive global dialogue, and we must start it at the United Nations.@@@We need to urgently consider the oversight of such systems and the necessary precautions to avoid miscalculations.@@@That is just one of the many facets to consider as we focus our minds on how to harness the potential and manage the risk of AL Singapore welcomes the Secretary-General’s decision to convene a high-level advisory body on Al to explore those critical issues.@@@Singapore is actually optimistic that the United Nations and the multilateral system will be up to the task of establishing norms on those fast-emerging critical technologies.@@@The open-ended working group on security of and in the use of information and communications technologies 2021-2025, which happens to be chaired by Singapore, has made steady progress, and this offers some useful lessons for other areas, including AL Singapore commits to continuing to support all efforts to promote international cooperation and strengthen global rules, norms and principles in the digital domain.@@@We also look forward to the adoption of a global digital compact at the Summit of the Future in 2024.@@@The reality is that many nations are not ready for the wave of digital transformation sweeping our world.@@@We should not forget that even today, more than 2 billion people still have no internet access, and we need to work far harder to bridge that digital divide.@@@As a tiny city-State.@@@Singapore is committed to supporting other small States by raising awareness, sharing experiences and building human capacity everywhere.@@@In 2022.@@@Singapore launched Digital Forum of Small States (Digital FOSS), a platform in which members of the Forum of Small States can learn from one another and mutually support each other in the area of digital technologies.@@@There is no doubt that those technologies are a powerful accelerator for sustainable development in developing countries, and all the more so in small States like mine.@@@But many developing countries and small States will need help to deploy and harness the benefits of those technologies.@@@As the most inclusive and universal body in the world, the United Nations has to be at the centre of our collective efforts to address those global challenges.@@@We can do so, as shown, in fact, by the recent adoption of an international legally binding instrument on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction (BBNJ).@@@Singapore is honoured that Ambassador Rena Lee served as the President of the Intergovernmental Conference on Marine Biodiversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction.@@@She worked tirelessly and closely with all delegations to bring that ship safely to harbour.@@@This week.@@@I was proud to sign the BBNJ agreement on behalf of Singapore, which intends to ratify it as soon as possible.@@@We call on all Member States to sign and ratify the BBNJ agreement so that it can enter into force early, and I am glad that, as of today.@@@81 Member States have signed the BBNJ agreement.@@@We need to bring the same constructive spirit to other areas of the global commons — AI, cybersecurity, digital technology and even outer space.@@@We do not lack policy ideas on strengthening multilateralism, but we need commitment and action.@@@The High-level Advisory Board on Effective Multilateralism has put forward six transformational shifts that will make the United Nations and the multilateral system future-ready.@@@For many small States, our survival and our very success require a strong United Nations and an effective multilateral system founded on the Charter of the United Nations and international law, and complied with by all States in the world.@@@The Forum of Small States, chaired by Singapore, will continue to work with all States, large and small, to make the United Nations stronger and ready for the future.@@@The Summit of the Future next year will be a crucial milestone in terms of repositioning the United Nations and the multilateral system for our future.@@@This Summit is also an opportunity to further accelerate the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@Singapore will work closely with all Member States and contribute constructively to that process.@@@We call on all delegations everywhere to take a pragmatic and action-oriented approach to the Summit.@@@It is not too late for us to work together to build a better, safer and fairer world for all countries and especially for our future generations.@@@At the outset.@@@I would like to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Dennis Francis on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session.@@@I am confident that, with his wealth of experience and excellent capability, he will help to ensure the success of this session.@@@I also wish to voice my appreciation for the significant contributions of His Excellency Mr. Csaba Korosi.@@@President of the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session, and His Excellency Antonio Guterres.@@@Secretary-General of the United Nations.@@@Having endured great suffering, sacrifices and losses from wars, separation and the embargo of the past century.@@@Viet Nam fully understands better than anyone, and profoundly appreciates, the value of peace, cooperation and development.@@@With perseverance and tireless efforts in the spirit of putting the past behind, overcoming differences, harnessing similarities and striving towards the future to turn enemies into friends and confrontation into dialogue, and by contending and cooperating to turn adversaries into partners.@@@Viet Nam is recognized by international friends as a model for post-war cooperation, recovery and reconciliation for the common development and prosperity of all parties concerned.@@@It would therefore be remiss not to mention the three most important and decisive factors in international cooperation — trust, sincerity and solidarity.@@@Trust helps to erase animosity and bridge differences, and it is a prerequisite for solid, effective and substantive ties.@@@Sincerity brings sympathy and reinforces at the national level hope, trust and solidarity, which make up the strength of a State, a nation and all its people.@@@Solidarity enhances multilateralism at the international level and creates global strength.@@@That is also the spirit that we wish to underscore and promote at this year’s session.@@@Only by building upon trust, sincerity and solidarity around the world, strengthening of the role of the United Nations and mobilizing the active participation of all States can we together address difficulties, overcome challenges and promote peace, cooperation and prosperity globally, regionally and nationally and bring about happiness and well-being for all people.@@@Over the past years, we have been facing tremendous hurdles.@@@While peace and stability prevail at the macro level, hostilities, conflicts and tensions remain at the micro level.@@@In addition.@@@I would say that arms races and the increasing threats from weapons of mass destruction loom large.@@@The consequences of the coronavirus disease continue to persist, while the global economy records a slow and unequal recovery, with high inflation and growing risk.@@@At the same time, non-traditional security challenges, natural disasters, climate change, environmental issues, food, energy, water and cybersecurity are evolving in a complex and unpredictable manner.@@@Moreover, the world today faces four critical crises.@@@First, there is a crisis of trust amid the most intense geopolitical tensions since the Cold War.@@@Secondly, there is a crisis of multilateral cooperation due to fragmentation and division.@@@Thirdly, there is a crisis of legal principles, reflected through the undermining of international law and the Charter of the United Nations in certain corners.@@@Fourthly, there is a crisis of resources to respond to global issues, such as poverty eradication, education, health, humanitarian assistance, diseases, natural disasters and climate change.@@@Against that backdrop, the critical question is: as leaders of the 
world, what do we need to do to help our respective nations and the world as a whole to overcome the current obstacles?@@@In my view, the answer is that we need to jointly build trust, showcase sincerity, bolster solidarity, enhance bilateral and multilateral cooperation, effectively respond to global and whole-of-population challenges and promote sustainable development, with the people as the centre, the actor, the goal, the driver and the resource for growth.@@@I am of the view that global challenges require global solutions.@@@In addition, as the issues affect each and every person, we should adopt a whole-of-population, comprehensive and holistic approach.@@@In that spirit.@@@I would like to outline the following five clusters of solutions.@@@First, it is necessary to build upon sincerity, reinforce strategic trust and call on countries to uphold responsibility as the basis for our efforts.@@@Sincerity and trust should be fostered and bolstered through candid dialogue on the basis of mutual respect, shared interests and joint efforts to address differences, as well as the prevention and containment of conflicts.@@@Responsibility is showcased by complying with international commitments, international law and United Nations Charter.@@@It is also reflected in refraining from the use of force, power politics, unilateralism and divisive and fragmenting actions.@@@In that regard, major Powers play a crucial and pioneering role in building trust, promoting sincerity and upholding responsibility through stronger commitments and more comprehensive support for global development.@@@Secondly, a global solution is to enhance international solidarity and cooperation.@@@Each country should place their interests in the broader picture of the international community’s interests and join hands to protect and promote multilateralism and enhance the central role of the United Nations.@@@That can be achieved through new and more robust multilateral initiatives and actions in the interests of all countries and peoples.@@@It is also necessary to support the Secretary-General’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) stimulus via vigorous, concrete, practical and effective commitments and actions.@@@Let us pursue unity instead of division, dialogue instead of confrontation and cooperation instead of isolation and divergence.@@@Once again.@@@Viet Nam affirms its solidarity with other countries, including Cuba, and urges the United States to put an end to its embargo against Cuba.@@@Thirdly, a whole-of-population solution is to promote policies that identify the people as the centre, the goal, the actor, the driver and the resource for sustainable development, while ensuring that no one is left behind.@@@Development can be truly meaningful only when it brings about practical benefits for each and every person, particularly in prioritized areas such as investment in promoting education, creating jobs and ensuring that the people are the centre of the policy- making process.@@@We must enhance and strengthen investment in education, creating employment, ensuring social security, providing health care, improving resilience and adaptation and preventing natural disasters and diseases.@@@Fourthly, it is essential to implement holistic political, economic and social measures to ensure security and stability.@@@We need to develop and transition into a green, digital, circular, sharing and smart economy, promote innovations and start-ups, reduce trade and investment barriers, facilitate market access and conclude more free trade agreements.@@@Viet Nam supports the reform of international institutions.@@@We need to expedite such reforms, particularly financial and monetary reforms, towards greater equity and equality for developing countries and less developed countries and improve their capacity to effectively manage risk.@@@Fifthly, we need to mobilize and effectively utilize resources, in which self-reliance, resilience and the effective harnessing of our potentials and advantages are important factors underlying the success, prosperity and strength of each nation and region and the world at large.@@@Developing countries, particularly least developed countries, are currently the most vulnerable to the severe consequences of climate change, natural disasters and diseases.@@@They should receive substantive and effective assistance in terms of finance, technology, human resources, development and governance coordination.@@@Viet Nam supports the Summit of the Future process to bring about important changes through a new mindset, a new modus operand!@@@and new actions, with a view to helping multilateral institutions operate in a more synchronized and effective manner and better respond to the needs and interests of all countries and peoples.@@@President Ho Chi Minh, the beloved great leader of Viet Nam’s people, a national liberation hero and a great man of culture, once said.@@@“A country is rooted in its people; only when the root holds strong can the tree stand firm.@@@We shall build the fort of victory on the foundation of our people’s efforts”
and
“Solidarity, solidarity, great solidarity; success, success and great success”.@@@By building upon that philosophy.@@@Viet Nam has recorded important and historic achievements after nearly 40 years of Doi Moi renovation across the board, particularly in terms of socioeconomic development and the improvement of the people’s living standards.@@@The multidimensional poverty rate in Viet Nam has dropped to below 2 per cent.@@@Viet Nam steadfastly pursues a consistent foreign policy of independence, self-reliance, multilateralization and the diversification of external relations.@@@We remain a friend, a reliable partner and an active, responsible member of the international community for the peace, cooperation, development and prosperity of all countries worldwide.@@@Viet Nam will continue to be a reliable and responsible partner of the international community.@@@Vietnamese men and women from the People’s Army of Viet Nam and police forces have been participating in United Nations peacekeeping missions, conveying a strong message of peace, friendship, cooperation and development.@@@We are also expediting energy transition to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.@@@In addition.@@@Viet Nam maintains food security for a population of 100 million people, while striving to export approximately 7 million tons of rice this year, contributing to ensuring global food security.@@@On this occasion.@@@Viet Nam would like to announce its national commitment towards the SDG transition.@@@From a region plagued by war and division.@@@South-East Asia has emerged as a region of solidarity, friendship and cooperation and an epicentre of growth.@@@Moreover, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) matters, and ASEAN has affirmed its centrality in maintaining peace, security and prosperity in the region.@@@We wish to reaffirm our commitment to working with other countries within and outside the region to safeguard peace, stability, security, safety and freedom of navigation in the South China Sea, in accordance with international law and the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.@@@It is also necessary to exercise restraint, refrain from unilateral actions and address disputes and differences by peaceful means, including diplomatic and legal processes.@@@The late Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold once referred to the United Nations as the new Santa Maria that can help us to brave tempestuous storms and explore uncharted seas of peace, stability, cooperation and development.@@@Let us be responsible sailors, stand united, uphold trust and act in unison to steady our helm and take the United Nations vessel to new horizons of greater and more inclusive prosperity.@@@On behalf of His Excellency Obiang Nguema Mbasogo.@@@President of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea.@@@I would like to begin by congratulating His Excellency Mr. Dennis Francis on his unanimous election as President of the seventy-eighth session of the General Assembly, and I extend those congratulations to the other members of the General Committee.@@@We assure him with absolute certainty and confidence that he can count on the support and cooperation of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea during his presidency.@@@We would like to convey the utmost expression of our heartfelt solidarity to the Kingdom of Morocco and to the State of Libya following the tragedies that those two fraternal countries recently experienced, which have led to great loss of life and to massive destruction of infrastructure.@@@The theme of the seventy-eighth regular session of the General Assembly is “Rebuilding trust and reigniting global solidarity: accelerating action on the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals towards peace, prosperity, progress and sustainability for all”.@@@Indeed, we welcome the relevance of this theme, as it fits perfectly into the current context of the most burning problems that the world is currently facing, including war, the increase in armed groups, the real threat of terrorism and mercenary ism, climate change, the prospect of new health crises, the economic and financial crisis, as well as the food crisis, which is likely to result in famine in various countries.@@@The moment is so decisive that it requires world leaders to seek lasting, consensual, transformative and sustainable solutions as intertwined challenges that have a cross-cutting and negative impact on all continents.@@@Once again we are here to denounce and condemn the interference of certain countries and the exploitation of our natural resources, which continue to be a determining factor is promoting underdevelopment, conflicts and instability, as well as the very worrisome and increasingly serious situation that the countries of the Sahel and other regions of the African continent are going through, with very negative implications for their development.@@@Africa deserves priority attention from support and assistance initiatives, with a decisive materialization of the financing commitments to sustainable development for the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals contained in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development — leaving no one behind to overcome all the phenomena that hinder Africa’s development.@@@We express our grave concern about the chronic crises that Haiti has been suffering.@@@Haiti is currently besieged by a gang of criminals inflicting enormous damage to the population.@@@Equatorial Guinea therefore proposes the holding of a United Nations conference for Haiti, in order to conduct an in-depth analysis and find a sustainable and lasting solution.@@@Equatorial Guinea insistently reiterates the need to reform the United Nations system, including the Security Council, which is currently one of the greatest injustices and constitutes a serious failure in the application of international law.@@@The African continent continues to suffer from the historical injustice of being the only continent without permanent representation in the Security Council, despite the fact that a large part of the issues on the agenda of that decision-making organ are matters of concern to Africa.@@@In this increasingly interdependent world, where no one can walk alone, we strongly reject the unilateral imposition of coercive measures that run counter to the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations and international law.@@@We urge States to refrain from enacting and applying them, as they severely hinder State development, especially in developing countries.@@@We once again raise our voice for the immediate lifting of the trade, economic and financial embargo imposed against the Republic of Cuba several decades ago.@@@This brotherly country deserves the opportunity to integrate into the global context as a sovereign country.@@@Before concluding.@@@I would like to inform the Assembly that the Government of Equatorial Guinea has conceived the 2035 strategic plan for economic diversification, and we would like our partners to join us in the implementation of that plan.@@@To that end, we extend an invitation to businessmen from all friendly and brotherly countries to come and invest in the attractive national market.@@@We live in a globalized world.@@@We are therefore expected to forge supportive partnerships of collaboration and solidarity through frank and inclusive dialogue in order to peacefully resolve current conflicts and inequalities, as well as our differences.@@@We call for the need and importance of giving greater priority to multilateralism and international cooperation, both so necessary to addressing the global challenges currently facing humankind as a whole.@@@Our determination to address pressing issues — from climate change to peace, security and development — is strong.@@@I have no doubt that, with a true spirit of solidarity, there will be no difficulty that we cannot overcome for the good of our planet and its people.@@@At the outset I would like to congratulate you.@@@Sir, on your election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session, and to wish you success during your term in office.@@@I also commend the outstanding efforts of your predecessor.@@@Mr. Csaba Korosi, during his presidency of the previous session.@@@I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate the support of the Kingdom of Morocco for the initiatives of Secretary- General Guterres aimed at enabling the Organization to address the world’s pressing challenges, which he outlines in his report Our Common Agenda (A/75/982).@@@In that context.@@@Morocco looks forward to participating in and contributing to the Summit of the Future in 2024.@@@I would like to express the gratitude of the Kingdom of Morocco to all the Heads of State and Government and Ministers who have expressed their solidarity and support to us following the earthquake that struck our country, and to thank them for their readiness to stand with my country in confronting the repercussions of that natural disaster.@@@Morocco has been dealing with the consequences of the earthquake, which led to the deaths of nearly 3.000 people and injured 5.700 others, in addition to grave material losses.@@@We are tackling those repercussions with determination, seriousness and solidarity, all of them values upheld by the people of Morocco.@@@From the first moments after the earthquake.@@@His Majesty King Mohammed VI gave instructions for mobilizing all State institutions, including the armed forces, national and local authorities, public forces and civil prevention teams, to take all the urgent measures needed to accelerate the rescue and relief of the injured and provide assistance to the families affected.@@@We immediately established an inter-ministerial committee to develop an emergency programme for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of the areas affected.@@@Under the personal leadership and direct supervision of King Mohammed.@@@Morocco has moved from the initial stage of urgent rescue and relief to that of rehabilitation and reconstruction.@@@He has given instructions for launching a well- studied, integrated, ambitious programme aimed at addressing all the consequences of this natural disaster thoroughly, quickly and consistently.@@@We have allocated an estimated $12 billion to the issue for the next five years, with a first phase covering all the areas affected and providing services to 4.2 million people.@@@The multidimensional programme was adopted following the identification and detailed assessment of the various needs, and it includes projects for rebuilding homes and restoring damaged infrastructure, as well as promoting 
socioeconomic development in the affected areas.@@@It will be financed from the State budget, the contributions of the committee and the special solidarity account established to address the effects of the earthquake, as well as from international support and cooperation.@@@King Mohammed has also stressed the importance of ensuring that the rehabilitation and reconstruction process is consistent with the architectural specifics and traditions of the areas affected.@@@The process must respect the residents’ dignity, norms and traditions.@@@In line with those measures, all components of Moroccan society, both inside and outside the country, have been participating in national efforts to provide assistance to the people affected, in a demonstration of our strong national unity and solidarity in difficult circumstances.@@@The earthquake that struck Morocco, the hurricane and floods that hit our sister State of Libya and the phenomenon of climate change generally continue to represent the greatest challenge facing humankind across the world.@@@That is why today, more than ever, strengthening prevention, resilience and international cooperation must be priorities of the international community.@@@This session is being held in a critical global context, marked by many challenges related to geopolitical tensions, climate change, poverty, migration, terrorism, hate speech, pandemics and natural disasters.@@@Nevertheless, the current pace of scientific and technological progress may constitute a source of optimism, provided that the current challenges lead to international cooperation and solidarity in the promotion of scientific research, including artificial intelligence, and encourage sharing its benefits in strategic priority areas such as health security, energy transformation, food and water security, modern technologies and natural-disaster mitigation.@@@The current circumstances require national policies aligned with our international commitments by focusing on the promotion of resilient societies through a comprehensive approach based on the principles of equity and social justice in order to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).@@@They also require that we promote a multilateral system based on cooperation and solidarity, with the United Nations at its core.@@@That approach was adopted by the Kingdom of Morocco, in line with the lofty directives of His Majesty King Mohammed VI, to launch structural workshops, foremost of which is the new development model, in order to enhance sustainable development, promote energy transformation, ensure the provision of water and social services and address natural disasters as part of an integrated vision in line with the SDGs.@@@His Majesty King Mohammed VI attaches great importance to the empowerment of women and the family, in general.@@@That is why His Majesty today issued a lofty letter to the Prime Minister to review the family code through inclusive consultations, with the participation of all stakeholders, for the subsequent submission of proposals to His Majesty to amend it within six months.@@@The Kingdom of Morocco expresses deep concern about the spread of hate speech, especially through social media.@@@This sows the seeds of division within societies and among cultures and States and exacerbates violent extremism.@@@It is the main factor of global instability.@@@That is what His Majesty King Mohammed VI highlighted in his lofty message to the participants of the ninth session of the Global Forum of the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations, held in the city of Fez on 22 and 23 November 2022, when he said:
“Our civilization has never confronted such numerous risks.@@@Coexistence has never faced such daily challenges.@@@Rarely have we feared and suspected others like we do today, and rarely has every triggered event been used to incite and inflame feelings of fear and hatred as it is today.”@@@We reaffirm the Kingdom of Morocco’s categorical rejection and condemnation of all attacks on religious symbols and holy books.@@@We strongly denounce the desecration and burning of the Holy Qur’an, which insults more than 2 billion Muslims around the world and is a violation of the most basic human rights.@@@The relevant countries must take all necessary measures to prevent such violations.@@@In line with that position, in July the Kingdom of Morocco presented resolution 77/318, on combating hate speech, which was unanimously adopted in the General Assembly by the Member States, condemning the desecration of holy books.@@@For the first time, such acts were classified as a violation of international law.@@@The resolution also called on the Secretary-General to organize the first conference on hate speech in 2025.@@@We recognize the important role of sports in bringing nations together and spreading a culture of 
peace and tolerance.@@@Consequently, the Kingdom of Morocco submitted its candidacy, jointly with Spain and Portugal, to host the 2030 World Cup finals.@@@His Majesty King Mohammed VI highlighted the meaning of that unprecedented candidacy, which brings together two continents and two civilizations — Africa and Europe—and unites the two banks of the Mediterranean, thus promoting the ambitions and aspirations of the peoples of the region for greater cooperation, understanding and communication.@@@The Kingdom of Morocco remains committed to a definitive political solution to the artificial regional dispute over the Moroccan Sahara, in order to promote development, stability and peace in the region and the African continent.@@@Morocco continues to support the efforts of the Secretary-General and his Special Envoy.@@@Mr. Staffan de Mistura, to relaunch a series of round tables, with the same format and the same participants, especially Algeria, the main party to that conflict, in accordance with Security Council resolution 2654 (2022).@@@We reaffirm that a definitive solution can only be political, realistic, practical and based on consensus.@@@The initiative for autonomy, as part of the Kingdom of Morocco’s territorial integrity and national sovereignty, remains the one and only solution to this artificial regional conflict.@@@There is no alternative.@@@On that basis, more than 100 countries from all over the world support today the Moroccan autonomy initiative.@@@Approximately 30 States and regional organizations have opened general consulates in Laayoune and Dakhla, thus affirming their full support for the Moroccan Sahara.@@@As part of our new development model for the southern regions, the Kingdom of Morocco has allocated a budget of over $10 billion to date.@@@Approximately 81 per cent of that model has been accomplished by launching many projects for achieving socioeconomic development and conducting trade between Africa and the rest of the world.@@@The Special Envoy of the Secretary- General.@@@Mr. Staffan de Mistura, personally witnessed those achievements during his visit to Laayoune and Dakhla, in the Moroccan Sahara, at the beginning of this month.@@@Those great efforts are part of the lofty directives of His Majesty King Mohammed VI, as mentioned in his speech commemorating the forty-seventh anniversary of the Green March on 6 November 2022, when he said: “Our defence of the Moroccan Sahara is based on a comprehensive perspective that includes diplomatic and political work, as well as advancing the economic, social and human development of the region.”@@@The Kingdom of Morocco reiterates its deep concern about the catastrophic humanitarian situation in the Tindouf camps in Algeria.@@@The host country.@@@Algeria, has illegally delegated its authority in the camps to a separatist armed group with confirmed and documented links to international terrorist and criminal networks, a disturbing situation that requires the attention of the international community, particularly in view of Algeria’s refusal to allow a registration and census of the people detained in the camps, which is a clear and flagrant violation of international law and of repeated calls from the Security Council since 2011.@@@The failure to register the population detained in Tindouf has permitted looting of the humanitarian aid sent to the camps, as has been confirmed in reports by international, regional and non-governmental organizations, most recently a World Food Programme report issued in January.@@@Morocco stands in full solidarity with our sister Maghreb country of Libya in the wake of the unprecedented floods in various parts of Libya that have resulted in enormous and serious loss of human life and property.@@@We express our sincere condolences and sympathies to the State, to our brother people of Libya and to the families of the victims of that painful tragedy.@@@We wish all the injured a swift recovery.@@@In accordance with King Mohammed’s directives.@@@Morocco will continue to stand with Libya’s legitimate institutions and support the international efforts aimed at resolving the crisis there based on the agreements concluded between the various Libyan parties.@@@First and foremost, we support the efforts of the United Nations aimed at reaching a permanent political solution to the Libyan crisis as outlined in the Skhirat agreement of 2015.@@@In that context.@@@Morocco hosted a series of meetings that resulted in an agreement in October 2022 between Libya’s Speaker of the House of Representatives and President of the High State Council on implementing the outcomes of the Bouznika meeting on sovereign positions and the unification of executive authority.@@@And from 23 May to 6 June of this year a meeting of the 6+6 joint committee of the House of Representatives and the High State Council was also held in Bouznika for the preparation of electoral laws.@@@resulting in major agreements on the organization of elections in Libya.@@@Morocco considers the Palestinian question a national priority and a focus of its foreign policy.@@@We call for avoiding any kind of escalation or violence in order to prevent the situation from getting out of control and to spare the Middle East region from further tensions that may hinder the revival of the peace process.@@@In that regard.@@@King Mohammed, in his capacity as Chair of the Al-Quds Committee of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, expressed the importance that Morocco attaches to the Palestinian question, saying
“With the same seriousness and determination, we stress Morocco’s firm position with regard to achieving a just solution to the Palestinian question and ensuring the legitimate right of our brother Palestinian people to establish an independent State, with East Jerusalem as its capital, in order to ensure security and stability for all peoples of the region.”@@@Morocco rejects all unilateral measures that undermine the legal and historical status of Al-Quds Al-Sharif.@@@We reaffirm our support for the Palestinian Authority, under the leadership of President Mahmoud Abbas, and for all its decisions aimed at preserving the legitimate right of the Palestinian people to achieve their aspirations and establish an independent State, with East Jerusalem as its capital, along the 4 June 1967 borders, and in accordance with an internationally agreed two-State solution and respect for the principles of international legitimacy and the relevant resolutions.@@@In conclusion.@@@I want to underscore the responsibility that all of us have as Member States to create the conditions that the United Nations needs to succeed, by providing it with the necessary resources and mobilizing the political will to reform it and streamline its working mechanisms so as to build a more just and more humane multilateral global system in a spirit of solidarity.@@@King Mohammed emphasized that task in his address to the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session, where he called for
“Must in the United Nations as the conscience of humankind and the bedrock of a new world order, where the values of peace, global security,  joint development, equality, tolerance, democracy and solidarity prevail.”@@@(A/59/PV.4, p.23)@@@Like most of the speakers who have preceded me.@@@I too would like to express my fraternal compassion and solidarity with the people of Morocco and Libya, who have been deeply bereaved in recent days by natural disasters with unspeakable consequences.@@@Just a few weeks ago.@@@I received a report from a mission that I had sent to Libya as part of the African Union peace and reconciliation mission that I have been leading for almost six years.@@@The report of that mission testified at length to the courage and resilience of the Libyan people, tired of living in division; a people who fight to shake off the demons of the partition of the country and to find the path of truth, reconciliation and peace; a people determined to embark on the path to recovery and regain prosperity.@@@It is to those brave and courageous people, who have given so much to Africa, that I extend my sincere condolences.@@@The theme of our general debate very clearly summarizes our common desire to qualitatively change the world.@@@That was already the generous philosophy and purpose of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to ensure peace, security and prosperity for all people on Earth.@@@Whether it is about eliminating poverty and hunger in the world, thanks to a fairer and more equitable global economy and to more efficient and sustainable agriculture; or whether it is about guaranteeing good health for the greatest number and quality education for the most disadvantaged, those are only absolute priorities.@@@So too, among others, are the supply of water and electricity to the broadest social strata; the construction of road, rail, port, airport and energy infrastructure to connect territories, countries, regions and subregions; the preservation of biodiversity ecosystems, in particular through responsible management of the tropical forests, which are among the most precious heritages that we have received from providence; the fight to change mentalities in the world, with respect for the diversity of cultural expressions and reciprocal tolerance; the anchoring in our societies of the idea of gender equality and male-female parity; and the empowerment of women and girls.@@@On that last point.@@@I would like to underline the preponderant share in the responsibility that women have assumed in my country over the past 15 years.@@@Today they are making an outstanding contribution to the promotion of their rights and freedoms, to the fight for the elimination of poverty and to the intensification of inclusive education, through all-round training and learning.@@@In short, all the priorities that I have just listed call on each of us to demonstrate a high sense of duty and responsibility, an openness to the virtues of dialogue, a solid impulse of solidarity, patience and resilience.@@@The balance of nations in the world seems to me to be largely dependent on that development and that option.@@@The climate is today the most pressing of all emergencies.@@@This emergency touches the heart of life in all its diversity.@@@It calls our existence in all its complexity into question.@@@The continual rise in sea levels that is endangering island countries, the sweeping desertification that nothing seems to stop, the suffocating heatwaves that kill many elderly people again and again, the repetitive floods and sudden mudslides that cause such visible damage — all those phenomena are as dangerous as they are devastating, and they now concern even the most sceptical among us.@@@That is why, assuming my share of responsibility in my capacity as President of the Congo Basin Climate Commission.@@@I launched, at the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Egypt, the Global Decade of Afforestation initiative for biodiversity and denser plant cover at the service of humankind.@@@In the same vein, my country, the Republic of the Congo, has committed to hosting, next October, a summit of the three basins of biodiversity ecosystems and tropical forests — Congo.@@@Amazon and Borneo-Mekong-South-East Asia — as a collective and concerted response from those three green lungs of the planet to the climate insecurity that is now so threatening.@@@Since the dawn of time, as we all know, the forest has supported millions and millions of people.@@@With one of the lowest deforestation rates in the world — only 0.06 per cent — my country is playing its full part in preserving the environment in the name of the survival of humankind.@@@Today we can only rejoice at the happy outcome of the inscription process of the Odzala-Kokoua natural park on the World Heritage List, which was concluded at the 45th session of the UNESCO 
World Heritage Committee, held recently in Riyadh.@@@That was undeniably an act of recognition that duly rewards the efforts of my country in the preservation of that natural jewel of nearly 1.2 million hectares, rich in animal and plant biodiversity, in the heart of the Congo basin.@@@The sacrifices made by local populations by voluntarily abandoning certain activities likely to harm the environment and the renunciation by States of development projects to preserve biodiversity ecosystems should also elicit action on the part of the international community financial compensation, which would in no way be charity.@@@In Africa, in terms of agricultural development, we know that we must protect arable land from the harmful impacts of climate change.@@@Without that precaution, production forecasts would become completely uncertain and nothing could be controlled.@@@Our responsibility as leaders is overwhelming in that regard.@@@Indeed, with a population that could amount to some 2 billion inhabitants in 2050.@@@Africa must now make a qualitative leap to secure sufficient quality food tomorrow and to forever exorcize the spectres of famine and the exodus of its populations.@@@Africa urgently needs modern agriculture, supported in particular by efficient irrigation and mechanization systems — an agriculture that must enable it to significantly reduce its food imports, which remain too high.@@@That is why I call for efficient technical and financial partnerships for substantial progress in that sector.@@@Africa has no need for partnerships underpinned by politically oriented official development assistance, which is synonymous with organized almsgiving.@@@Subsidies in dribs and drabs, doled out to the rhythm of the donors’ own interests, will certainly not allow the real and effective development of our continent.@@@This session of the General Assembly is being held at a time when wars and other armed conflicts are raging around the world.@@@This is the place to hammer home once again that no significant progress will be possible on any continent or in any country without peace.@@@The hope of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals assigned by the United Nations will only be a pipe dream if we do not ourselves create the first of all the conditions necessary for their achievement — namely, peace.@@@For its part and whenever circumstances have permitted, the Republic of the Congo has always worked for the peaceful resolution of conflicts in Africa and around the world.@@@That is how my country decided to take an active part in the African initiative for peace mediation between Russia and Ukraine.@@@Due to the threat of widespread warfare that such events pose to the world, not only the two protagonists in this conflict, but also the foreign Powers that can influence the course of events in the direction of peace should all temper their ardour, stop fanning the embers and engage without delay in peace negotiations — fair, sincere and equitable negotiations.@@@The world urgently needs those negotiations to prevent the ongoing clashes, which are already so devastating, from further escalating and tipping humankind into what could be an irremediable cataclysm, that is to say, a total war that would spin out of the control of the great Powers themselves.@@@I remain convinced that the wise recommendations made by Africa to restore peace between Ukraine and Russia will eventually be taken into account.@@@In my capacity as Chairman of the African Union High-Level Committee on Libya.@@@I cannot remain silent before the Assembly concerning the tragic situation which that country has been experiencing since 2011.@@@It is a situation in which I am deeply invested in the name of the African Union.@@@The peace efforts made within the framework of that thorny issue continued recently, in July, in the context of a reconciliation meeting that took place in Brazzaville, in my country, and that allowed several actors representing the heart of Libyan political and social sensitivities to sit at the same table.@@@Everything was done to persuade the protagonists to transcend their differences and to ally their understandings of the challenges facing tomorrow’s Libya.@@@The inter-Libyan reconciliation conference that the mediation I chair is seeking to convene will make sense only if it is inclusive, constructive and consensual.@@@It must allow our Libyan brothers and sisters to reconnect through the virtue of dialogue by ceasing to look at each other as if they were strangers, to learn to forgive each other and to give precedence to justice, on the basis of the rule of law whose history they are called on to write.@@@I call once again for the support of the international community, starting with the countries of the subregion and the organizations that unite them, without forgetting the so-called Quartet countries, with a view to winning concrete support for our efforts in order to open a solid and credible prospect for the definitive resolution of the crisis, which has lasted too long.@@@Faced with the unilateralism that is dangerously eroding the foundations of the beautiful edifice that so many generations have worked to build since 1945, the Republic of the Congo, through my voice, reaffirms its commitment to multilateralism, a guarantee of justice in international relations, balance, equity, peace and cooperation for shared development.@@@Multilateralism, as we all know, can prosper only in a fair and equitable global system that no longer reflects the fantasies of the past, but the developments and realities of our time.@@@There is therefore an urgent need to reform its go-to tool, the Security Council, in order to ensure a fairer representation of all continents and all peoples of the world.@@@In that regard.@@@Africa has a Common Position, a conciliatory and consensual position, sealed at Ezulwini, that my country has championed tirelessly for more than a decade.@@@I reiterate here and now the African demand, legitimate in all respects, to see two of its States sit on the Security Council as permanent members, with the right of veto.@@@That would be the only just outcome before history.@@@Due to time constraints.@@@I shall deliver an abridged version of my statement.@@@The full version is available to all representatives.@@@Today I am delivering my nineteenth statement to the General Assembly.@@@I would like to congratulate Mr. Dennis Francis on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session.@@@I assure him of the Bangladesh delegation’s full cooperation throughout the session.@@@I also commend his predecessor.@@@Mr. Csaba Korosi, for his successful steering of the seventy-seventh session.@@@I would also like to express my deep appreciation to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for his strong commitment to strengthening multilateralism and for his efforts, bold statements and far-sighted and pragmatic steps towards making the United Nations deliver on its mandates and meet the challenges of the current world.@@@At this critical juncture.@@@President Francis’s call for rebuilding trust and reigniting global solidarity reminds me of the maiden speech delivered by our Father of the Nation to the Assembly.@@@Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman stated in his address to the Assembly in 1974:
“The great economic upheavals that have recently shaken the world should generate a sense of urgency for building a just economic order. ...@@@Only a regeneration of the feeling of human solidarity and brotherhood and an acknowledgement of interdependence can bring about a rational solution and the urgent action needed to avoid this catastrophe.”@@@(A/PV.2243.@@@/mm 8 and 9)@@@In that connection, we deeply appreciate the Secretary- General’s initiative to convene the Summit of the Future next year.@@@We hope that this process will amply complement our efforts to attain the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@Since assuming office in 2009, we have transformed Bangladesh from a lower-middle income country to a middle-income country.@@@We reduced the poverty rate from 41.5 per cent in 2006 to 18.7 per cent in 2022 and the extreme poverty rate from 25.1 per cent to 5.6 per cent.@@@We have expanded the social safety net coverage to ensure the social and financial security of destitute women, widows, the elderly, persons with disabilities, persons of third gender and other marginalized segments of society.@@@Forty million people are receiving the benefits of our social safety net programme, directly or indirectly.@@@In the current fiscal year, a total of $12 billion has been allocated to the social safety net programmes.@@@This year, we have introduced a universal pension scheme through which any citizen aged between 18 and 50 years of age can access old- age benefits.@@@We are committed to ensuring women’s empowerment and gender equality within a stipulated timeframe.@@@We have given special attention to overall education, including female literacy.@@@We have been providing textbooks free of cost up to the secondary level since 2010.@@@From primary to higher education, about 23 million students are being provided with stipends, scholarships and one-time grants.@@@More than half of those recipients are female.@@@Despite contributing less than 0.47 per cent of global emissions.@@@Bangladesh is one of the most climatically vulnerable countries in the world.@@@The adverse effects of climate change pose serious threats to the security and economic prosperity of our present and future generations.@@@Urgent, bold and ambitious collective actions are needed to address those threats.@@@We established the Bangladesh Climate Change Trust in 2009 to finance climate adaptation and have to date allocated $480 million to the fund from our own resources.@@@Under the Ashrayan project, a landmark initiative of my Government for landless and homeless people.@@@5 million people from 840.000 families have been provided with houses free of cost.@@@The developed economies must fulfil their $100-billion commitments.@@@We also demand the urgent operationalization of the Loss and Damage Fund, as agreed at the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.@@@We call for stronger global solidarity in sharing the burden of climate migrants induced by sea-level rise, salinity increase, river erosion, floods and drought.@@@The interlinked crises of the past few years have pushed up the prices of food, energy and commodities globally, with negative impacts on our economy.@@@Despite those challenges, we have ensured food for everyone.@@@We are providing 10 million people in the low-income bracket with rice and other commodities at 
affordable prices.@@@We have taken various steps to keep inflation under control.@@@I thank the Secretary-General for forming the Global Crisis Response Group in 2022 and for the Group’s continued advocacy and solutions in addressing the global food, energy and financial crises.@@@We are deeply concerned that the Black Sea Grain Initiative has become defunct and call on all parties concerned to secure its early restoration.@@@Moreover, for countries like ours, the uninterrupted access to fertilizers must be ensured.@@@As part of Vision 2041, my Government is heavily investing in building a Smart Bangladesh to transform the country into a high-income, poverty-free, developed nation, grounded in the proper utilization of science and technology and powered by innovation.@@@In Bangladesh, we have achieved exemplary success in bringing primary health-care services to the grassroots level through community clinics.@@@Bangladesh’s success has been recognized and appreciated by the General Assembly.@@@After peaceful settlements of maritime boundaries with our neighbouring countries, the blue economy has opened up a new horizon for the development of Bangladesh.@@@We believe that the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea need to be effectively implemented to ensure sustainable use of marine resources.@@@The day before yesterday.@@@I signed the agreement under the United Nations Convention on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction.@@@Our commitment to global peace and security is well manifested in our contribution to United Nations peacekeeping operations.@@@As of now.@@@188.000 men and women from Bangladesh have served in 55 peacekeeping missions in 40 countries.@@@Relying on our own experience, we are also actively contributing to post-conflict reconstruction efforts through our leadership role in the United Nations Peace-building Commission.@@@We strongly support the role of the Commission in strengthening the United Nations prevention agenda.@@@We remain concerned at the continued prevalence of terrorist threats that are now taking new forms due to the misuse of information and communication technology.@@@My Government maintains a zero-tolerance policy against terrorism and violent extremism.@@@Acts that undermine communal harmony and the peaceful coexistence of people of different faiths and beliefs are serious crimes.@@@Bangladesh believes in communal harmony.@@@As an elected member of the Human Rights Council, we are working with fellow member States to safeguard all human rights of people around the world.@@@I would like here and now to unequivocally reiterate that Bangladesh will continue to promote democracy, the rule of law and freedom of expression, in line with our Constitution.@@@This year marks the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Nakba, the catastrophe inflicted upon the people of Palestine.@@@It is deeply troubling that the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people have remained unmet.@@@We will pursue our efforts to realize the rights of the people of Palestine.@@@Bangladesh will stand by Palestine.@@@It has been six years since the forcible displacement of the Rohingyas from Myanmar.@@@Out of humanitarian concern, we have given them temporary shelter.@@@The displaced Rohingyas want to return to their own country and live a peaceful life there.@@@Let us ensure that those destitute people can soon return to their homes..@@@On 15 August 1975, my father, the father of our nation and the incumbent President of Bangladesh.@@@Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, was brutally assassinated.@@@A total of 18 members of my family were killed that day, including my mother, my three younger brothers, two sisters-in-law and my parental uncles.@@@Only my younger sister and I survived the brutality, as we were abroad at that time.@@@Before that, in 1971.@@@3 million of our countrymen were killed during our great War of Liberation, while 200.000 women were heinously tortured and abused.@@@As a victim of and witness to the brutalities of war and assassination.@@@I can feel the pain and agony that people endure due to the horrors of wars, killings, coups d’etat and conflicts.@@@Therefore, my appeal today to all the leaders of the world is to shun the path of war and confrontation and to work collectively for enduring peace, the well-being of humankind and economic prosperity for our people and future generations.@@@I congratulate His Excellency Mr. Dennis Francis on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session.@@@Let me also pay tribute to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for his dedication to global peace and prosperity.@@@This year marks the seventieth anniversary of the Korean War armistice.@@@After the invasion by communist totalitarian forces, the fate of the Republic of Korea hung in the balance.@@@Thankfully, with the support of United Nations forces, the nation dramatically defended its freedom.@@@The determined decision of Trygve Lie, the first Secretary-General of the United Nations, who viewed the armed invasion of the Republic of Korea as a challenge to world peace and led the effort to convene the Security Council to adopt resolution 84 (1950), intervening in the war, remains deeply ingrained in the minds of the Korean people.@@@Over the past 70 years.@@@Korea has risen from the ashes of war to blossom into a liberal democracy and a market economy.@@@Today Korea is determined to contribute responsibly to the international community with the goal of promoting social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom, as championed in the Charter of the United Nations.@@@The theme of the seventy-eighth session of the Assembly is “Rebuilding trust and reigniting global solidarity: Accelerating action on the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals towards peace, prosperity, progress and sustainability for all”.@@@The war in Ukraine, which has been going on for a year and a half, has deepened the divisions in values and ideologies within the international community.@@@It has also exacerbated the economic repercussions of the coronavirus disease pandemic, causing the global economy to contract and leading to food and energy crises in many parts of the world.@@@In difficult times, it is the vulnerable who suffer more.@@@In the face of today’s multifaceted global crises on an unprecedented scale, the divisions among countries are widening in various areas, including security, economy, technology, health, environment and culture.@@@To bridge those divides and ensure harmonious coexistence among all nations, the international community must stand together, with the United Nations at its core.@@@Today I would like to address those divisions in three key areas — the development, climate and digital arenas.@@@Many countries around the world still lack infrastructure essential to everyday life.@@@Development is unattainable without basic infrastructure such as water and sewage systems to process and supply water for drinking and daily use, energy facilities to provide electricity and health care to treat the sick.@@@To narrow the development divide, countries with financial and technological capacities must take on responsible roles.@@@Korea is intending to boldly increase its official development assistance (ODA).@@@Despite this year’s fiscal austerity measures, the Korean Government has raised the ODA budget plan for the upcoming year by more than 40 per cent.@@@As a result.@@@Korea’s ODA budget is expected to more than double next year compared to fiscal year 2019.@@@We will allocate the increased ODA funds to foster development cooperation tailored to the needs of our partner countries.@@@In particular, we will actively channel our ODA efforts into education and training, to help partner countries build the capacity to progress economically and socially on their own.@@@It is said that a year of education can increase income by approximately 10 per cent.@@@That impact is more pronounced among low-income groups and women.@@@We must expand those benefits on a global scale.@@@The climate crisis is another challenge that exacerbates the economic divide between nations and impedes humankind’s sustainable development.@@@This past July, we experienced the hottest summer ever recorded on Earth.@@@On this boiling Earth, extreme weather events such as heatwaves, torrential rains and typhoons have become the norm.@@@Climate change is causing geopolitical shifts in agriculture and fisheries, worsening the crises in countries that are vulnerable to food shortages.@@@To assist countries that are vulnerable to climate change in reducing their carbon emissions and accelerating their transition to clean energy.@@@Korea will scale up its green ODA.@@@In particular, we will contribute an additional $300 million to the Green Climate Fund.@@@We anticipate the international community’s active financial support for the Green Climate Fund.@@@We also hope that the international community’s collective resolve to bridge the climate divide will lead to tangible actions.@@@Korea will not only harness renewable energy, but it will also extensively employ high-efficiency carbon-free energy, such as nuclear power and hydrogen, as a realistic measure for accelerating our pursuit of carbon neutrality.@@@We also plan to share those energy sources with countries that are vulnerable to climate change, ensuring that they can benefit as well.@@@To that end.@@@Korea aims to pursue international joint research on carbon-free energy and facilitate technological innovation and investments from the private sector.@@@Korea will also launch a carbon-free alliance — an open platform that anyone in the world can join to promote the adoption of carbon-free energy.@@@Next.@@@Korea plans to play a leading role in bridging the digital divide, utilizing our strengths in information and communications technologies.@@@Today, with advancements in digital technology, cultures and industries are shifting towards digital-based paradigms.@@@The digital divide is a major cause of economic divide.@@@Therefore, bridging the digital divide will contribute positively to resolving the challenges faced by the global South.@@@Korea will support the digital transformation of countries with limited digital penetration and utilization, which will enhance their citizens’ access to education, health care and financial services.@@@Last September at New York University and in June at the Sorbonne in Paris.@@@I stressed that digital advancements can be achieved only when fair access to artificial intelligence (Al) and digital technologies, as well as their safe use, is ensured.@@@I have also proposed the establishment of an international organization under the United Nations to discuss and set forth rules regarding digital ethics.@@@If we fail to curb the spread of fake news resulting from the misuse of Al and digital technologies, our freedom will be at risk, the market economy anchored in liberal democracy will be in peril and our very future will be under threat.@@@Korea plans to introduce in the near future a digital bill of rights to outline a desirable future for the digital order.@@@To support the creation of an international organization under the United Nations and provide concrete directions for the development of Al governance, the Korean Government plans to host a global Al forum.@@@We also plan to collaborate closely with the high-level advisory body on Al being established by the United Nations to provide a network for communication and collaboration among global experts.@@@Without international peace and security, development and prosperity will remain elusive.@@@During my visit to Kyiv last July.@@@I saw the sorrow in the eyes of children being treated at the national children’s hospital.@@@Children are our future, yet children are often the first victims of war.@@@In line with our commitment to our Ukraine Peace and Solidarity Initiative, the Korean Government will implement a comprehensive support programme that encompasses security, humanitarian assistance and reconstruction.@@@Furthermore, as I pledged at the Group of 20 Summit just two weeks ago.@@@Korea will actively support Ukraine’s reconstruction by providing $300 million next year, as well as a mid- to long-term support package exceeding $2 billion.@@@The nuclear and missile programmes of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea pose not only a direct and existential threat to the peace of the Republic of Korea, but also a serious challenge to peace in the Indo-Pacific region and across the globe.@@@It is paradoxical that a permanent member of the Security Council, entrusted as the ultimate guardian of world peace, would wage war by invading another sovereign nation and receive arms and ammunition from a regime that blatantly violates Security Council resolutions.@@@In such a situation, the call to reform the Security Council will receive broad support.@@@If the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea acquires the information and technology necessary to enhance its weapons of mass destruction capabilities in exchange for supporting Russia with conventional weapons, the deal will be a direct provocation that threatens the peace and security of not only Ukraine but also the Republic of Korea, which, together with its allies and partners, will not stand idly by.@@@While military strength may vary among countries, by uniting in unwavering solidarity and steadfastly adhering to our principles, we can deter any unlawful provocation.@@@As a member of the Security Council for the 2024-2025 term, the Republic of Korea is committed to playing a responsible role in promoting and building global peace as we work closely with fellow United Nations States Members.@@@Passing on to future generations an international order grounded in justice and the rule of law, along with sustainable freedom.@@@peace and prosperity, is a historic responsibility shared by all of us here today.@@@The Republic of Korea, together with the United Nations, will readily take on that responsibility.@@@The Republic of Korea aspires to host World Expo 2030 to fulfil its responsibility and contribute to the international community.@@@Busan served as the last bastion defending the freedom of the Republic of Korea when most of the country was invaded and conquered by communist forces more than 70 years ago.@@@It was also Busan that rose from the ruins of the Korean War and became the world’s second-largest transhipment hub, leading the Miracle on the Han River.@@@Without Busan.@@@Korea would not have been able to stand where it is today.@@@Now the Republic of Korea will play its role as a responsible member of the global community by hosting World Expo 2030 in Busan — a gateway that links the Eurasian continent and the Pacific.@@@Korea intends to give back to the international community by sharing its experience of economic growth and development, reciprocating the help that it has received in the past.@@@The Great Exhibition of 1851 in London was an exposition of the industrial revolution, while the 1900 Paris Exposition was one of culture.@@@The 1962 Seattle Expo was an exposition that inaugurated the new space era.@@@The 2000 Hannover Expo was an exposition devoted to the environment.@@@The 2030 Busan Expo will be an exposition of solidarity.@@@Freedom and solidarity are the basis of Korea’s foreign policy.@@@Building upon those values, the 2030 Busan Expo will serve as a platform for solidarity, through which the world’s citizens can overcome crises and spread freedom together.@@@The Busan Expo will be a festival in which all nations can come together to share their history, culture, goods and visions for the future.@@@The Expo will make a significant contribution to the freedom, peace and prosperity of citizens around the globe.@@@It is my honour, in this, my second year as the Prime Minister of Saint Kitts and Nevis, to join with members of the global family of nations and speak on behalf of the people of Saint Kitts and Nevis, at home and in the diaspora.@@@However.@@@I must first extend condolences across the world to people, who in a summer of scorching heat — the hottest in recorded human history — suffered every disaster known to humankind: fires, floods, droughts, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes and, with 
them, untold personal, social and economic tragedies.@@@I especially express the heartfelt pain of the people of Saint Kitts and Nevis with regard to the recent disasters in Libya and Morocco.@@@We, in Saint Kitts and Nevis, are suffering the worst drought of our history, resulting in severe water shortage.@@@Of course, we too have not escaped unscathed.@@@I extend my sincere congratulations to you.@@@Sir, on your election to preside over the General Assembly during its seventy-eighth session.@@@Your election has given pride and satisfaction to Saint Kitts and Nevis and indeed the Caribbean Community, and it stands as further testimony to the fact that small island developing States (SIDS) can contribute to positions of global leadership.@@@Your term comes at a time of international complexity and conflict, of great global tensions and even greater global aspirations, and of new geopolitical dynamics and even newer technologies, which are transforming every aspect of life as we know it.@@@These are times of great divides in income and wellbeing, combined with such growing insularity and loss of trust that they shout the need for what Secretary- General Guterres has rightly identified as the centrality of prevention, coordination and partnership.@@@Saint Kitts and Nevis shares the view that this must be a period in which we work to prevent an enormous downward slide socially, economically, environmentally and with regard to security for the people of the world.@@@There is an alarming lack of trust the world over — a lack of trust in State and global organizations, of trust in the traditional media and what some regard as its management and manipulation of information, and of trust in the political class.@@@In a world of distrust, the United Nations and its Member States must show a sense of caring, inclusion and respect for the dignity of all to ensure that “We the peoples” is a statement of unity, and a clarion call for the word “common” to be truly reflected in how we view the global commons and how we work together to achieve the agenda for the common good.@@@If we are to rebuild trust and reignite global solidarity, leaders, particularly those in wealthier countries, must mean what they say and say what they mean.@@@Developing countries are groaning under the weight of burgeoning challenges not of their own making, and I daresay some of which were inherited as a result of colonization and the transatlantic slave trade.@@@Millions of Africans were uprooted from their homelands and transported across the Atlantic in the hulls of ships to be enslaved on plantations.@@@That was the largest forced migration in human history, and it resulted in great wealth for some at the expense of the lives and dehumanization of African peoples.@@@It must be noted that compensation was paid to plantation owners, while the survivors of that crime against humanity were left in suffering and were hindered in their socioeconomic development.@@@It is therefore past time for reparatory justice, and I encourage all to work together constructively as partners in the pursuit of justice and of respect for justice.@@@For, as Martin Luther King.@@@Jr., said.@@@“[T]he arc of the moral universe is long but it bends towards justice”.@@@We must maintain our focus on the climate challenge.@@@The behemoth industrial countries and companies are pushing small island developing States (SIDS) and others onto the front lines of climate change.@@@They accept little responsibility for financing the adaptation and mitigation measures necessary to the survival of developing countries, which suffer the consequences of the lifestyles and industries of others.@@@As a result, countries like mine, which are unable to access concessionary funding, are forced to fix the climate crisis by obtaining loans at exorbitant rates from the very countries where the problem originated.@@@Our carbon footprint, as a country, is very small, and yet we are facing the existential threat of climate change.@@@That is unjust.@@@We therefore call for climate justice.@@@There is an urgent need for the international community to address the gaps and shortfalls of the current international financial architecture with a view to strengthening support for SIDS, in particular through a multilateral sovereign debt mechanism, meaningful reform of the governance of the international financial institutions and enhanced access to financial resources.@@@I congratulate the World Bank on its recent steps in the right direction.@@@However, there is still much ground to cover if States like mine are not to fail and our economies and societies are to remain viable.@@@I commend the Bridgetown Initiative of my sister Prime Minister Mia Mottley, as having the potential to effect the kind of changes that are essential to ensuring equitable growth and sustainable development.@@@I see as an outcome to addressing the issue of access to capital the development of a relevant and effective multidimensional vulnerability index.@@@I would like to caution, however, that to be effective, debt must be part of the metrics used for the assessment and ranking of countries.@@@Furthermore, the risk and cost of wipe-out environmental events, in which a single event or series of events literally wipes out 5 per cent or more of gross 
domestic product, as well as the capacity to recover from such events, are all important metrics if such an index is to work.@@@At the national level, our Government has commenced efforts to further ensure the holistic and resilient development of our communities.@@@That undertaking is articulated in our vision for transforming our country into a sustainable island State by 2040, and demonstrates the determination with which we take ownership of our own destiny and pursue our sustainable development aspirations.@@@Our vision is buttressed by seven pillars — food security, a green energy transition, economic diversification, sustainable industries, the orange economy, coronavirus disease recovery and social protection.@@@Those overarching areas include environmental sustainability, sustainable lives and livelihoods, health and wellness and fiscal and debt resilience.@@@To that end, we have made strides towards geothermal energy production and have utilized loans from the Caribbean Development Bank for that national development project, together with the collaboration of groups such as the Atlantic Council and the United States-Caribbean Partnership to Address the Climate Crisis.@@@We have strengthened our healthcare delivery and management.@@@We have learned the lessons of the pandemic and are now better prepared for crises in health, although the work continues.@@@We are also building more transparent and participatory governance structures, as demonstrated by our enactment of legislation on integrity in public life and good governance.@@@We have developed programmes for the most vulnerable and marginalized, specifically women, young people, the elderly, the disabled and the Rastafari community.@@@We want to ensure that Saint Kitts and Nevis leaves no one behind.@@@We aspire to create a society where our people can live in safety and security.@@@However, we are plagued by the scourge that is the proliferation of illicit and untraceable weapons flowing into our region.@@@The States that manufacture those weapons must take greater responsibility for combating those illegal flows, which can threaten our national and regional security and have devastating socioeconomic consequences.@@@We cannot win the fight against the guns on our own.@@@International cooperation is necessary if we are to ensure the protection of our societies and our people.@@@To that end, we thank the United States for increasing its collaboration with the region, and with my own country, in order to deal with the illicit trans-shipment of guns and buttress our overall national security apparatus.@@@We must continue to work together to ensure continued success in that regard.@@@It is a matter of great concern that glaring global inequities persist and are growing wider, despite sustained calls for global solidarity, action and cooperation.@@@For example.@@@Venezuela has been placed in a precarious situation as a result of the application of sanctions, and its people continue to bear the brunt of those unilateral measures.@@@We therefore urge strongly for constructive dialogue between the Governments of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and the United States to relieve the hardships that those impositions have caused the Venezuelan people.@@@It should also be noted that while others benefit from access to Venezuela’s natural resources, its Caribbean neighbours are denied as a result of the sanctions.@@@Continuing on the subject of inequities and the need for respect for sovereign States.@@@Cuba, which has been a generous global partner, is caught in the clutches of an unjust and continuing economic, commercial and financial embargo that has caused suffering to a people who do not deserve it.@@@The people of Saint Kitts and Nevis stand in solidarity with the Government and the people of Cuba and call for an immediate end to the embargo and for Cuba’s removal from the unilateral list of State sponsors of terrorism.@@@Speaking to the issue of Governments and peoples excluded from full participation within the United Nations and the global multilateral systems.@@@I would like to point to the situation of Taiwan, which has proved to be a reliable development partner that greatly contributes to collective efforts to address the pressing global issues of today.@@@It is our firm belief that Taiwan should be able to make its contribution to the work and budget of multilateral institutions such as the United Nations and the World Health Assembly in furtherance of the common global goals.@@@It is our hope that the right of its 23 million people to adequate representation can be realized.@@@Beyond that, we urge for peace in that region of the world, as war would have severe consequences for all of us.@@@Closer to home, the ongoing dire situation in our sister nation of Haiti demands the sustained attention and support of the international community.@@@Haiti, the first Black Republic in the Western hemisphere, continues to grapple with an unimaginable scale of human suffering.@@@A political resolution is urgently needed, along with recognition that appropriate measures must be taken to reverse Haiti’s legacy of underdevelopment.@@@We cannot move forward with the acceleration of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development if we continue to knowingly and deliberately leave some people behind.@@@We are living in a world in flux, where new and emerging poles and spheres of influence are challenging the existing so-called rules-based order.@@@New currencies are being internationalized, new trade routes are taking shape and new security, political and economic blocs are emerging to drive geopolitical advantage.@@@The voice of the Global South is growing bolder, with increasingly louder rumblings among powerful blocs calling for change.@@@The need for an enhanced role and presence of developing countries from the Global South within the Security Council could not be more compelling.@@@We are convinced that in the face of those complex changes, reform of the Security Council is needed to better reflect contemporary geopolitical realities and enhance its effectiveness.@@@In conclusion, that reform is critical.@@@Let us consider a reset.@@@On the heels of the fortieth anniversary of my country’s independence, we declare that there should be a reset.@@@We can consider it here, for it gives us the opportunity to establish an improved path to what we seek to achieve as an Assembly.@@@Today, at a time that is as challenging as it is exciting, we stand at the juncture of what is and what could be.@@@We know what is, and we understand what could be.@@@Ours is a challenge to ensure peace, prosperity, progress and sustainability for all.@@@Saint Kitts and Nevis accepts that challenge and remains a ready and willing partner in our collective quest for a better world that we all deserve.@@@Saint Vincent and the Grenadines would like to congratulate you.@@@Mr. President, on Trinidad and Tobago’s assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session.@@@We also affirm our solidarity with the Governments and the peoples of the Kingdom of Morocco and Libya at this their current hour of peril, consequent upon the recent natural disasters in their countries.@@@We express our sincerest condolences for the immense loss of life.@@@Across the world today, in large measure, men and women are feeling pain.@@@They are gripped with melancholy and adrift.@@@They are perplexed, even confused, by the complexities and challenges of our human condition, which is awash with multiple contradictions from which arises a yearning for sustainable resolutions.@@@Large numbers of people, globally, are possessed of a mixture of resignation, a sense of futility, a routinization of indifference, even cynicism.@@@And yet at the same time there resides in them, in us, an elemental hopefulness and a sense of social solidarity, a quest for justice and goodness, for the pursuit of equity and equality and for peace, security and prosperity for all — not just for a privileged few in a handful of privileged nations.@@@It is widely acknowledged that the global political economy is broken and needs fixing, not by tinkering here and there, but through fundamental restructuring of a kind that will endure for the benefit of all humankind, especially those who are disadvantaged, dispossessed or marginalized.@@@It is widely accepted, too, that the vital Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will not be attained by 2030.@@@Indeed, there will be a significant deficit for practically every developing country.@@@Similarly, it is widely recognized that the climate-change agenda is stalling and in some respects reversing, with dire consequences for humankind, particularly the most vulnerable countries.@@@At the same time, war and conflict rage senselessly across the globe.@@@In at least one case.@@@Ukraine, the principal 
adversaries may be unwittingly opening the gates to a nuclear Armageddon.@@@Contemporary drivers of insecurity and conflict are all jostling one another in an invidious march to infamy and human misery.@@@The expansive and expanding list includes racism and xenophobia; the continuing oppression of women under a patriarchy in too many countries; the seemingly uncontrollable chariots of artificial intelligence; threats of pandemics and the anti-people consortiums of Big Pharma; poverty and food insecurity; ignorance, miseducation and disinformation; terrorism and its associated malcontents; illegal trafficking in persons and narcotics; the subversion of participatory democracy and human rights; the failure or refusal of former colonial Powers to entertain just and legitimate demands for reparations to remedy the contemporary legacies of underdevelopment caused by native genocide and the enslavement of African bodies; and the failure or refusal of the major emitters of greenhouse gases to cough up the resources that the vulnerable countries affected need for adaptation, mitigation, loss and damage.@@@And the list goes on.@@@The melodies that are heard are troubling, while those that go unheard are damning.@@@Powerful countries and blocs of like-minded States are unwilling or unable to fashion inclusive, effective modalities through genuine multilateralism to address the global challenges facing humankind.@@@Their reflex actions in quest of a continuing imperium or an emergent hegemony are dressed up as self-serving calls for a new world order — all sauce and gall but of little or no substance, and difficult to swallow.@@@From the rough trenches of the periphery.@@@Saint Vincent and the Grenadines responds yet again with three haunting questions.@@@What exactly is new?@@@Which world?@@@And who gives the orders?@@@In that context, after decades of futile bickering and foot-dragging, we should urgently embrace genuine reform of the Security Council.@@@Surely sensible compromises on the matter, reflective of the condition of our world today, are long overdue.@@@In these troubled and uncertain times, enveloped in limitations and weaknesses, there are nevertheless possibilities and strengths.@@@We need this collective, the United Nations, to immediately display wise and mature leadership in our great endeavour to put things right for humankind.@@@We who are gathered here to represent national or regional interests are not, and cannot reasonably be, agents of purely impersonal forces inexorably driving humankind to further peril or even damnation.@@@Notwithstanding the imperfections of a multilateral system grounded in international law and civilized norms, we in the Assembly, in concert with one another and our peoples, can be the fresh hope, the beacon and the light, not merely to inspire but to draw out of each other and our respective peoples a goodness, a quality and a nobility that we may often not yet know we possess.@@@In that process.@@@Ictus clear certain ideational cobwebs from our brains.@@@For example, it is wholly unhelpful to frame the central contradictions of our troubled times as revolving around a struggle between autocracies and democracies.@@@Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, a strong liberal democracy, rejects that wrong-headed thesis.@@@It is evident to all right-thinking persons devoid of self-serving hypocrisy that the struggle today between the dominant Powers is centred on the control, ownership and distribution of the world’s resources.@@@The struggle has been and continues to be about who gets what, when, where and how.@@@Civilized living now demands fairness, justice, peace, security and prosperity for all.@@@That civilized goal is unlikely to ever be satisfactorily attained if the strong and powerful continue to do what they can with impunity while the weak and fragile suffer what they must, despite their often-enfeebled resistance.@@@Throughout history, powerful countries have exhibited a certain schizophrenia.@@@They possess and deploy all their instruments of domination yet are racked by bewildering insecurities that frequently turn them into beasts of unreason, to their own detriment, as they overreach and sow the seeds of their own downfall, sadly and needlessly hobbling humankind in the process.@@@Let us accord mature consideration to a matter of immediacy in “our America”, to use Jose Marti’s telling formulation.@@@We urge our friend the United States of America — the most powerful and economically dominant country since the dawn of human civilization, a nation that espouses humane values — to end the unilateral and oppressive sanctions and impositions, contrary to international law, that it has rolled out against Cuba.@@@Nicaragua and Venezuela.@@@It is also plain silly and factually incorrect to label Cuba a State sponsor of terrorism — a label prompted by partisan domestic politics in south Florida that hurts the Cuban people massively and unnecessarily.@@@The sanctions and coercive measures against Venezuela, including the weaponization of the United States dollar, have caused the collapse of the PetroCaribe agreement, which delivered substantial benefits to more than a dozen 
Caribbean countries, including Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.@@@We in the Caribbean have thereby become collateral damage.@@@At the same time, it is long overdue for the Republic of China.@@@Taiwan, to be brought in from the diplomatic cold.@@@That magnificent Chinese civilization, through the fever of history, has delivered to the contemporary world, in practical terms, more than one recognizable national political expression institutionally.@@@Surely Taiwan’s quest for participation in the relevant specialized agencies of the United Nations is reasonable and ought to be accommodated.@@@Taiwan has repeatedly shown itself to be a responsible member of the international community.@@@Peace across the Taiwan Strait is an imperative for the prosperity and security of the world.@@@On the bundle of issues related to climate change, including global warming, biodiversity challenges, land degradation and desertification, we see a veritable Tower of Babel.@@@There is an overabundance of sweet sounding lyrics by the major emitters, but they turn out to be bitterly deceptive.@@@The lack or inadequacy of meaningful corrective action by the irresponsible climate polluters, both countries and companies, is an unpardonable, egregious wrong and indeed a species of barbarism.@@@The upcoming twenty-eighth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in the United Arab Emirates is a critical test of humankind’s commitment to saving our planet from the ravages of human-made climate change.@@@We know the oft-repeated benchmarks and the corrective agenda.@@@I do not have to repeat them here.@@@In that composite package of policies and measures, special consideration has to be accorded to the most vulnerable countries, such as small island developing States in the Caribbean and the Pacific and the poorer communities in climate-distressed areas of Africa.@@@Asia and Latin America.@@@Criss-crossing the issue of financing for development in the era of climate change, and the ramifications of the downside of structural distortions in the global economy for poor and vulnerable middle-income countries, is the Bridgetown Initiative 2.0, which has already been endorsed by the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC), the Alliance of Small Island States and dozens of countries in the African Union and elsewhere.@@@That progressive initiative contains creative financing proposals that would result in much greater resources, made available on highly concessionary terms, for poor and vulnerable regions.@@@The Multidimensional Vulnerability Index championed by vulnerable middle-income countries, including those in the Caribbean, has a place in the reform mix of financing for development.@@@Saint Vincent and the Grenadines urges the Assembly to show strong support for the Bridgetown Initiative and the Multidimensional Vulnerability Index.@@@Saint Vincent and the Grenadines also endorses the initiative of the Bahamas to remove from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development — the rich club — any global authority it assumes for suzerainty on international taxation and related matters.@@@Properly, they ought to be resident in the United Nations.@@@As developing countries, we must refrain from being mere prideful villagers, obsessed with immediate trifles and blind to far more compelling issues beyond our individual control, which demand a unifying solidarity with others in order to confront our struggles successfully.@@@Poor, vulnerable, climate-distressed and resource-challenged developing countries are absolutely fed up and insulted by the unfulfilled perennial promises of the developed world on climate financing.@@@In September 2015, at our United Nations, all nations signed on to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, targeted for achievement by 2030.@@@Earlier this week, the bundle of issues centred on the SDGs were accorded special consideration and there has been canvassing to revitalize them, which is admirable.@@@But the critical issue of ensuring sufficient financing for development, including climate financing and reparations, remains the proverbial elephant in the room and must be effectively harnessed if we are to serve the deserving.@@@Here again, the commitments we have agreed on and entered into must be translated into real action.@@@As part of the conversation on the SDGs.@@@Saint Vincent and the Grenadines has been insisting that there must be a special carveout for reparations from European countries for the legacies of underdevelopment engendered by the genocide of indigenous peoples and the enslavement of African bodies — horrendous crimes against humanity.@@@In that matrix, we need a special focus on Haiti.@@@The case for reparatory justice within the framework of the SDGs is compelling and unanswerably strong.@@@The time for reparations has come — the demand will not go away.@@@Africa, the Caribbean and our diaspora, and others 
who hanker for a just world, are insisting on it.@@@In our Caribbean Community, one of our member States.@@@Haiti, continues to be confronted by immediate and multiple existential challenges in the political, security, social, humanitarian and environmental domains.@@@CARICOM is seeking to facilitate a political solution by engaging with the widest possible cross-section of stakeholders to fashion a Government of national unity to replace one that is bedevilled by a lack of legitimacy and effectiveness, and to pave the way for democratic elections in a suitable time frame.@@@The Security Council cannot reasonably remain aloof from that process, considering the circumstances in which criminal gangs, including those with links to the Government and the National Police, are essentially in control of the capital city.@@@Security supports — not an imperial invasion — are required to accompany a political consensus so as to bolster humanitarian assistance, economic development and a more orderly way of life and living.@@@The situation is dire and growing worse by the day.@@@We must not allow ourselves the luxury of Haiti fatigue.@@@Indeed, the guns and bullets in the hands of the Haitian gangs are also in the bosoms of assorted criminals across the Caribbean and Latin America, and are sourced mainly from the United States.@@@The United States, the Caribbean and Latin American Governments must work together more earnestly to stop the massive flow of guns and bullets.@@@We urgently need solutions for the wars and perennial conflicts across the globe.@@@For example, the terrible situations in Ukraine.@@@Palestine and a number of countries in Africa and elsewhere are crying out for peaceful settlements between the warring tribes.@@@It is inhumane and wrong that the Palestinian people have had to endure colonial domination and externally induced suffering for decades.@@@In our America.@@@CELAC, currently led by the pro tempore presidency of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, is at the forefront of the quest to fortify our political cooperation and enhance integration efforts.@@@CELAC is building vital bridges with several blocs and countries across the world, with the aim of promoting peace, security, prosperity and sustainable development for all.@@@It is vital that our shared experiences be translated into shared expressions, including institutional expressions, in order to do the practical work of enhancing life, living and production for all humankind.@@@In addition.@@@CELAC ought to be allowed to follow the African Union into membership in the Group of 20.@@@Let us be more inclusive in solving intractable problems in practical ways.@@@I therefore welcome the European Union’s proposal to initiate an institutional summit bringing together the European Union, the African Union.@@@CELAC, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the Secretary-General of the United Nations.@@@I await the details.@@@The days of masters and vassals are over.@@@The end days of imperialism are drawing nigh, and the would-be hegemons waiting in the wings with their illusions of grandeur, past or imagined, are bound for disillusionment.@@@In any new world order, the metaphoric lions and lambs must lie down and rise up together in mutual self-interest and for a better world.@@@This world of 8 billion people deserves better.@@@We in the developing world reject the crumbs.@@@There is a loaf to be shared reasonably, with equity, and we must be at the tables where the decisions are made and the food is eaten.@@@Those who think that our heads are in the clouds are profoundly mistaken.@@@We know that in the great cathedral of the sky there is a sun for a steeple.@@@It illuminates our pathways, and we see things clearly, and men and women who see things clearly will never give up on the pursuit of peace, goodness, equity and justice.@@@We do so with urgency, yet with patience and calm, knowing that even now the greener leaves explode, sun brightens stone and all the river burns.@@@As I conclude, a summation by Daniel Williams, one of my country’s poets, is apt.@@@“We are all time; yet only the future is ours to desecrate.@@@The present is the past, and the past our fathers’ mischief”.@@@In order to avoid desecrating the future, we must be serious about the challenges at hand and work assiduously, in solidarity, to address them satisfactorily.@@@To be sure, there is no perfection this side of eternity, but we can do better than we have been doing.@@@Time is not on our side.@@@Let us not sleep to dream, but dream to change the world for the better.@@@We created this institution recognizing that while our interests as countries may differ, we have shared purpose as people, because we can only solve our biggest problems together, because we determined after the last world war to prevent it ever being repeated, and because all of us can see the world as it is and, by listening to each other and by acting together, all of us can choose to shape it for the better.@@@Australia is home to people from all nations of the world, and we draw on the knowledge of first peoples carrying forward the oldest continuing culture on earth.@@@We know that at this time, when its success has never been needed by more of the world’s peoples, this institution and our shared multilateral system is falling short of the commitments we have made together, and we are collectively falling further behind.@@@There are more people displaced, and more people hungry.@@@There is more conflict, and greater risk that a nuclear weapon could be used.@@@The climate is changing faster than our combined efforts to stop it.@@@Already.@@@African agricultural productivity has dropped by a third.@@@Within just 22 General Assemblies from now, more than 900 million additional people in sub-Saharan Africa will have less water than they need.@@@In many countries, including my own, floods or fires have overwhelmed communities.@@@The most tourism-dependent region in the world, the Caribbean, faces the loss of half its tourism revenue because of extreme weather, and nowhere is the climate threat more profound than in the Pacific.@@@Kiribati.@@@Tuvalu and the Marshall Islands are only a few metres above sea level.@@@Article 1 of the Charter of the United Nations speaks to maintaining peace and security, but there can be no security if the sea itself closes in.@@@That is why the voices and experiences of the Pacific matter.@@@Australia, as a member of the Pacific Islands Forum, believes in Pacific sovereignty and solidarity.@@@The connections between the first peoples of our lands and waters and the peoples of the Blue Pacific stretch back through time.@@@We share the Pacific Ocean, and as custodians of one-fifth of the earth’s surface, we understand our duty to amplify the collective Pacific voice and to act.@@@We are determined to make Australia a renewable energy superpower.@@@Within this decade.@@@82 per cent of Australia’s electricity generation will be renewable — a huge transformation from the 32 per cent when our Government came to office just last year.@@@Australia is supporting the region’s transition to renewable energy, helping countries to build climate resilience and access our increased climate finance contributions.@@@In Palau, for instance, up to a fifth of the country’s energy needs will be provided by new solar and battery storage through our Infrastructure Financing Facility for the Pacific.@@@Australia is sharing our innovations in climate adaptation in the Pacific and beyond.@@@We are supporting improved food security in some of the most vulnerable communities in the world, including with irrigation technology that has improved crop yields and reduced water usage by 30 per cent for farmers in countries including Malawi.@@@Mozambique.@@@South Africa.@@@Tanzania and Zimbabwe.@@@Climate is far from the only crisis the world faces.@@@The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic propelled 124 million people back into poverty, and humanitarian needs are burgeoning.@@@Australia is part of the global response.@@@In the last 12 months, we provided humanitarian assistance for more than 20 crises in which the United Nations requested international support.@@@Those crises are making it harder to achieve our 17 shared Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), but they are not the only reason we are falling short, and many developing countries are rightly frustrated.@@@Through the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the world committed to a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future.@@@At the halfway point, we have seen stagnation or regression on nearly a third of the targets, and we are not on track to meet any of them.@@@But we ought not be tempted to abandon some goals so that we might concentrate on others.@@@The great wisdom of the 2030 Agenda is in its recognition of the connection between different aspects of social and economic development and environmental protection — and how, together, they enable prosperity and peace.@@@We all invested years in negotiating this Agenda.@@@It provides an irreplaceable framework for collective global action, and all Member States must protect it and deliver on what we have agreed.@@@All United Nations officials, from the Secretary-General down, must guard against dilution, because the approaching climate tipping point means we simply cannot afford ongoing unsustainable development, nor will we ever maximize our development while leaving people behind or if we pick and choose between universally agreed human rights, as enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.@@@The drafters of the Universal Declaration — people like Bertha Lutz of Brazil.@@@P.C. Chang of China.@@@Minerva Bernardino of the Dominican Republic.@@@H.J. Mehta of India.@@@Eleanor Roosevelt of the United States and Jessie Street of Australia — were all seized of this simple fact: human rights apply equally to all people, no matter who you happen to be or where you happen to be born.@@@This was a global charter for the whole human family from East to West and North to South.@@@That was 75 years ago, and it was reaffirmed 30 years ago in the Vienna Declaration.@@@Yet today approximately 2.4 billion women of working age do not have equal opportunities, when we know that if we closed the gender gap in economic participation, we would add at least $12 trillion a year to global gross domestic product, in other words, generating three times more than the cost of fully achieving the SDGs.@@@However, to deliver the SDGs we must address systemic shortcomings and funding needs.@@@Small island developing States, including Cabo Verde and Samoa, have advocated for reforms to international development financing to reflect the reality that income per capita is an imperfect predictor of development need.@@@The tragic fact is that development gains can be quickly reversed by shocks such as extreme weather events.@@@We still need income measures such as gross national income, but we also need to listen to what many countries are saying about other growing vulnerabilities they face, especially as a result of climate change.@@@Therefore.@@@Australia commends the work of the High-level Panel on the Development of a Multidimensional Vulnerability Index, led by the Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda and the former Prime Minister of Norway.@@@That is but one tool that can be used to improve what the international development financing architecture delivers for the most vulnerable countries in the world.@@@The world needs more from international financial institutions, especially the multilateral development banks.@@@Their institutional capacity, their direct contributions and the multiplier effect of those contributions could be propelling the world much closer to realizing our shared development goals.@@@As the Group of 20 Independent Experts Group has highlighted, to transform development, the multilateral development banks will have to transform themselves, and the window for action is closing fast.@@@Australia welcomes the leadership of the Prime Minister of Barbados.@@@Mia Mottley.@@@And we are looking at how we can partner on the Bridgetown Initiative.@@@With 22 of our 26 nearest neighbours being developing countries, we want to contribute to a region where all our countries and peoples can thrive.@@@Therefore, we have instituted a new development policy and rebuilt our official development assistance programme with nearly 1.7 billion additional Australian dollars over five years, providing for ongoing growth over the long term.@@@And we have re-channelled $3 billion of our International Monetary Fund special drawing rights allocation to support vulnerable countries.@@@Therefore, today I call on all developed countries to increase their re-channelling of special drawing rights to boost concessional longterm investment critical to resilience-building and disaster response.@@@Australia also recognizes that the multilateral development banks and bilateral donors need to do more to harness the capital, innovation and energy of the private sector.@@@Therefore, last month, we launched Australian Development Investments, a 250 million Australian dollar impact investment fund to do just that.@@@And we have launched Invested: Australia’s Southeast Asia Economic Strategy to 2040, responding to calls from our regional partners for Australia to play a bigger role in their pursuit of economic opportunity, development and growth, which will support our shared security and prosperity.@@@All our efforts are aimed at helping countries to build their own resilience and sovereignty to ensure countries are not held back by unsustainable debt.@@@Australia’s investments are a statement of its belief that social and economic progress are preconditions for peace, just as peace is a precondition for progress.@@@Peace is not a gift, and it is never a given.@@@We are called on to play our part in diplomatic reassurance, economic development and military deterrence, all contributing to keeping and building peace.@@@Australia has always pursued a world where differences and disputes are settled through institutions, agreed rules and norms and not by power and size.@@@We have been active in the United Nations peace-building agenda since its inception, focused on addressing the underlying factors that contribute to conflict.@@@We are proud of our peace-building reform work with Angola in leading negotiations on parallel Security Council 
and General Assembly resolutions (Security Council resolution 2282 (2016) and General Assembly resolution 70/262) that shaped the sustaining peace agenda.@@@We look forward to 2025 when Australia will have a seat on the Peace-building Commission, coinciding with the review point for those resolutions.@@@Since the creation of the Peace-building Fund, we have been a consistent partner, and we are a top 10 donor.@@@Our commitment to international peace and security is reflected in our history of involvement in peacekeeping — some 62 operations over more than 75 years.@@@We remain the eleventh largest financial contributor to the overall United Nations peacekeeping budget, in addition to operational support and regional troop training.@@@We support a strong role for regional leadership on peacekeeping.@@@We welcome Fiji’s proposal to establish a new Pacific peacekeeping network to strengthen our region’s capacity and cooperation, just as we welcome the call from African States for United Nations assessed contributions for African Union-led peace support operations.@@@Our commitment to international peace and security is why Australia seeks a seat on the Security Council for 2029-2030, and it is why we pursue Security Council reform.@@@We must ensure greater permanent and non-permanent representation for Africa.@@@Latin America and Asia, including permanent seats for India and Japan.@@@And we must demand more of the permanent members, including constraints on the use of the veto.@@@With its special responsibility as a permanent member of the Security Council.@@@Russia mocks the United Nations every day it continues its illegal and immoral invasion of Ukraine, just as Russia mocks the international community with its cynical games on food security that leave millions hungry, promising grain to vulnerable nations yet at the same time destroying Ukrainian grain silos along the Black Sea coast.@@@The rest of the permanent members and all Member States must be unyielding in their response to Russia’s grave violation of Article 2 of the Charter of the United Nations.@@@If we waver in our response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, we will be validating the most fundamental of breaches of international law.@@@Who might be the next victim of State-based aggression?@@@However, even with all the conflicts on the United Nations agenda, even as we face the existential threat of climate change, the world faces another existential threat, one risk that is consequential for every Member State.@@@That is the risk of conflict between great Powers.@@@This Assembly of nations knows that strategic competition is not new.@@@Through the course of history, it has played out across the globe.@@@Often small countries, vast distances from major Powers, have borne the brunt of a race for dominance, with legacies of those contests casting shadows across generations.@@@But the modern arms race forever transformed the scale of great Power competition and pushed all of humankind to the brink of Armageddon.@@@In 1962, one of those close calls spurred the construction of conflict prevention infrastructure between the United States and the Soviet Union: guardrails that responsibly managed Cold War competition and kept it from careering into conflict.@@@Today’s circumstances mean we need to commit anew to building such preventive infrastructure to reduce the risk of crisis, conflict and war by accident.@@@The Indo-Pacific is home to unprecedented military build-up, yet transparency and strategic reassurance are lacking.@@@Tension is rising between States with overlapping claims in the South China Sea, and disputed features have been militarized.@@@And North Korea continues to destabilize with its ongoing nuclear weapons programme and ballistic missile launches, threatening Japan, the Republic of Korea and the broader region.@@@When one adds dangerous encounters in the air and at sea, including between nuclear Powers, we are faced with a combination of factors that give rise to the most confronting circumstances in decades.@@@In short, military power is expanding, but measures to constrain military conflict are not, and there are few concrete mechanisms for averting it.@@@So it is up to all of us to act to deploy our collective statecraft, our influence, our networks and our capabilities to minimize the risk of misunderstanding and miscalculation in order to prevent catastrophic conflict.@@@Peace-building today must rise to that challenge.@@@That is why Australia is contributing to a strategic equilibrium — to help to maintain the conditions for peace through our diplomacy, while playing our part in transparent, collective deterrence of aggression.@@@We seek to ensure that no State concludes that the benefits of conflict outweigh the risks.@@@And we seek new measures for conflict prevention that reinforce the region’s existing economic and security architecture.@@@The desire for peace is seen across our region.@@@The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is determined to develop practical ways to implement the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific and play a leading role in promoting peace, security, stability and prosperity in our region.@@@We support its aim.@@@ASEAN is right to affirm that disputes must be resolved peacefully, in accordance with international law, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the ASEAN Charter and the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia.@@@Consistent with that architecture and the need to address the growing risk of conflict.@@@Australia welcomes President Widodo’s statement, as Chairman of the East Asia Summit, noting that the recent leaders’ meeting:
“reaffirmed the need for all EAS-participating countries to promote open channels of communication to reduce risks of misunderstanding and miscalculation and prevent conflict in our region.”@@@New measures to prevent great power conflict are an Australian priority, and we hope they are a priority shared by Member States throughout the General Assembly.@@@Strategic trust is clearly in short supply.@@@We would be wise to encourage modest steps, focused on mutual strategic reassurance, military risk-reduction measures and on opening lines of communication at all levels.@@@Communication should never be withheld as a punishment or offered as a reward.@@@Given how conflict could be sparked, there would be benefit in pursuing clearer arrangements among maritime countries — all maritime countries equally — to prevent unsafe actions at sea.@@@And given that it is nuclear weapons that most risk catastrophe, we must work harder to achieve a world free of nuclear weapons.@@@Our Government is renewing Australia’s enduring commitment to a world without nuclear weapons.@@@We will continue to work with others to strengthen the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons—the cornerstone of the global nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament regime — despite those who seek to damage it for their own gains.@@@This week Australia joined Japan and the Philippines to urge progress on a fissile material cutoff treaty.@@@That would address a critical gap in our disarmament architecture, by stopping the production of material needed to create nuclear weapons.@@@Australia is also working with the International Atomic Energy Agency to ensure the peaceful use of technology and combat proliferation and nuclear security risks.@@@Australia wants a world where no country dominates and no country is dominated.@@@We want a world where we achieve our shared Sustainable Development Goals for people, planet, prosperity, peace and partnership.@@@We also see how all of that could be destroyed by crisis, conflict and war.@@@Which path we choose is up to all of us.@@@It is up to all of us to have the humility to listen.@@@It is up to all of us to act — and act urgently — on what we hear.@@@We must recognize that many developing countries are inadequately served by too much of the international system — a system that must be reformed as a matter of urgency.@@@And we must take these steps because we need everyone to know that they have a stake in the success of these United Nations — our United Nations.@@@All countries must have a stake in the United Nations Charter and exercise their agency to uphold it.@@@Because in today’s world, there is no zero-sum game.@@@In today’s world, there can never be just one winner.@@@In this age of existential threats, there is either a shared future or no future.@@@We can choose only between shared failure or shared success.@@@Let us all choose success.@@@It is indeed a pleasure for me today to sincerely thank, first of all, the American authorities for the warm welcome extended to us every time we are here in New York to participate in this major annual gathering of the international community.@@@Next.@@@I would like to warmly congratulate Mr. Dennis Francis on being elected to preside over the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session.@@@I am even happier to do so as it is a representative of the group of small island developing States — my country is one of them — who has assumed that important responsibility.@@@There is no doubt that his professional qualities and experience, together with his special understanding of the development challenges that are part and parcel of insularity, will ensure the success of the work of the current session.@@@I also take this opportunity to pay a much-deserved tribute to his predecessor.@@@Mr. Csaba Korosi, for the effective manner in which he discharged his duty on behalf of us all.@@@Lastly, on behalf of my country and the African Union.@@@I would like to sincerely thank Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for his ongoing commitment and that of all of his teams in the service of our common institution for the benefit of us all.@@@As Chairperson of the African Union.@@@I would like to convey today before the Assembly the voice of all African States, which continue to believe in fairer and more effective multilateralism, because it is more inclusive and therefore can help bring about the profound changes that are so sought after to ensure a better life on the continent and throughout the world.@@@We firmly believe that wish will be realized via the in-depth reform of the United Nations system.@@@Africa, where 3.8 billion people will live by the end of the century, intends to play a crucial role in attaining the Sustainable Development Goals, and therefore has the right to participate in global decision-making bodies and, among other things, to be a permanent member of the Security Council, enjoying its rights, in line with the Ezulwini Consensus.@@@It is a matter of equity.@@@The reform of the United Nations, for which Africa has been clamouring, is also a question of effectiveness.@@@It is a matter of legitimacy, and therefore the effectiveness of multilateralism.@@@I also take this opportunity, on behalf of Africa, to reiterate our sincere gratitude to the members of the Group of 20 (G20), which just welcomed the African Union, over which I have the honour to preside, into that Group in 2023.@@@That diplomatic victory for Africa and for the G20, through India, where that historic decision was enacted, gives us hope, in particular at a time when coordinated action is needed to extricate our countries from their socioeconomic crisis.@@@The theme of the seventy-eighth session of the General Assembly.@@@“Rebuilding trust and reigniting global solidarity: accelerating action on the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals towards peace, prosperity, progress and sustainability for all”, is very timely.@@@The African continent faces several challenges, and there is a danger that those challenges could jeopardize its future.@@@And I believe that the trust and the solidarity highlighted this year will provide us with the right solutions for our concerns.@@@Africa faces challenges related to food security, which are becoming increasingly common on the continent despite the fact that the continent has vast stocks of arable land and an abundance of skilled and competent workers.@@@Yet food insecurity continues to affect millions of people.@@@The effects of climate change and the numerous conflicts on the continent compound the situation, as does the Russian-Ukrainian war, which led to the disruption of supplies of grain and fertilizer and unprecedented inflation.@@@Members will agree that it is inconceivable that, with all its arable land, the continent remains a major importer of agricultural products, contributing to a significant deficit in its trade balance.@@@Therefore, as we speak of solidarity, it is high time for the partnerships among African Governments, development organizations and foreign and local private sectors to be strengthened in order to address those challenges effectively and sustainably.@@@It is also high time for our partners to support us in the implementation of ambitious reforms, including the transfer of expertise and technologies, in order to help those countries most affected promote agricultural development and, more specifically, to produce, transform and store their products locally in order to give them added value and thereby combat shortages and famine.@@@We must also step up the fight against the effects of climate change.@@@We are all experiencing it — our planet is constantly facing various climatic hazards, in particular cyclones, floods, rising sea levels and drought, to name but a few.@@@Such increasingly frequent disasters of course have devastating impacts on economies, social infrastructure, agriculture and populations, particularly the most vulnerable, and lead to health crises that accentuate the vulnerability of our continent.@@@I also take this opportunity to renew our heartfelt condolences and our solidarity with our brothers and sisters in Morocco and Libya, whose countries just suffered enormous human and material losses as a result of natural disasters.@@@I also have in mind the many countries in Europe.@@@Asia and America that are suffering head-on the devastating consequences of forest fires, floods and storms.@@@In addition to the numerous human losses, let us emphasize that the damage caused by natural disasters is enormous and entail reconstruction and recovery costs that are not always within the reach of the States affected.@@@I therefore call on the international community to favour common, structured and better adapted approaches — especially in the context of financing — to respond to those large-scale disasters so that we can provide our populations with the necessary support to alleviate their hardships.@@@Above all.@@@I call for the effective implementation of the recommendations linked to the protection and preservation of the environment, as well as the concretization of the commitments made in favour of adaptation and mitigation.@@@The reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions and the funding promised to combat climate change must be translated into concrete actions if we indeed wish to live in a safer and more prosperous world.@@@I therefore call for support for the Moroni Declaration for Ocean and Climate Action in Africa, signed in June, and the African leaders’ Nairobi Declaration on Green Growth and Climate Finance Solutions, of last September, so that our countries can defend, with one voice, their common interests in favour of sustainable development, particularly at the twenty-eighth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Dubai.@@@We wish the Conference every success.@@@Finally.@@@I would like to launch an appeal for strengthening the capacities of the United Nations Human Settlements Programme through more substantial support for the implementation of the New Urban Agenda.@@@That will enable the agency to better support our African cities, which are brimming with potential but have become very vulnerable to climate change.@@@I cannot talk about the challenges faced by the African continent without focusing on the complex and worrisome political and security situation that prevails there, particularly in the Sahel.@@@As we all know, the Sahel region of Africa has been severely affected by insecurity and terrorism since 2010, with terrorist groups intensifying their attacks against security forces, civilians and infrastructure.@@@It is therefore urgent that the international community strengthen its efforts to support us in stabilizing the region, given the knowledge that, in the global village in which we live, crises are easily imported and spread, with consequences for economies and inter- and intra-State investments in particular.@@@Certainly, it is primarily up to Africans to implement economic and social development plans in the framework of Agenda 2063 of the African Union in order to fight against poverty and youth unemployment, and above all to prevent our young people from falling hostage to extremism in all its forms.@@@However, it is also the duty of the international community to support 
Africa in that process, because our actions must be pooled to have a chance of being effective.@@@In addition to terrorism.@@@Africa also faces the resurgence of unconstitutional changes that undermine democracy, peace and security, stability and socioeconomic development.@@@In that connection, the African Union has taken sanctions measures against those who commit terrorist acts and demands the rapid return to constitutional order in the countries concerned.@@@I solemnly recall that there can be no political life worthy of that name without respect for electoral deadlines and the legitimate institutional mechanisms that underpin the democratic life of our countries.@@@Africa, although under pressure, is fighting for regional integration in order to emerge from its economic crisis.@@@The economic shocks suffered by our countries, in particular due to inflation and logistical and food crises, have seriously affected our growth potential, as well as the daily lives of our populations and the stability of our States.@@@Against that backdrop, the African Continental Free Trade Area — our large continental common market — has been implemented since 2021 in the hope of revitalizing Africa’s growth and gross domestic product.@@@With that essential tool, the acceleration of which is my mission during my mandate as President of the African Union, the continent gives itself the means to create leverage effects that will allow it to release the wealth necessary to better cope with its population growth.@@@The African Continental Free Trade Area will in fact contribute to the realization of our common ambition to move towards the industrialization of the continent, because Africa must stop being a simple supplier of raw materials.@@@While making it possible to strengthen our secondary and tertiary sectors and to create employment, the African Continental Free Trade Area will also stimulate the transfer of technologies and promote foreign investment, as it will give other continents immediate access to a market of more than 1 billion people.@@@Allow me to reiterate our request for support in strengthening the strategic partnership between Africa and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) — or indeed its institutionalization — and the establishment of a joint African Union-CELAC commission.@@@That partnership will not only strengthen South-South cooperation in the mutual interests of our States, but it will also better capitalize on the partnership with our friends in the North.@@@Like the rest of the world.@@@African countries need peace and security now more than ever in order to be able to enjoy better living conditions.@@@Peace and development will also require the settlement of political and territorial issues linked to the sovereignty of States and the dignity of nations.@@@It was those concerns that prompted some of my African counterparts and myself to meet with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and President Vladimir Putin as part of an African peace mission last June to Kyiv and Saint Petersburg, respectively.@@@We are therefore ready to support all other initiatives aimed at helping to put an end to the war, which is having a negative impact on our ambitions to promote the well-being of our people.@@@I also reiterate — again, with a view to preserving peace and stability and on behalf of the African Union — the urgent need to reach a just and equitable solution to the question of Palestine, a solution that enshrines the right of the Palestinian people to a sovereign State, living in perfect harmony and security alongside the State of Israel.@@@As Chairperson of the African Union and President of the Union of the Comoros.@@@I would also like to solemnly reiterate the Comorian nature of the island of Mayotte and to recall that, in order to make progress on handling the issue, we have chosen to engage in a dialogue with the French side with a view to resolving that unpleasant dispute in the interest of both our countries.@@@I would like to emphasize my deep desire, which is also that of the Comorian Government, to honour the institutions and democratic life of the Comoros by organizing the next presidential and gubernatorial elections in 2024 in a free, transparent and democratic manner.@@@I would also like to point out that, as a result of the national reconciliation policy that I have been pursuing since 2000, the Union of the Comoros has been able to put an end to the cycle of political instability that had characterized Comorian political life since independence in 1975.@@@That policy of reconciliation, supported by the African Union, the United Nations and all our partners, has brought stability to the country, and it is our duty to consolidate and entrench it.@@@Since 2002, the date of 26 May has become a symbolic reference point for the transition of power in the Comoros, as it marks the transfer of power following free and transparent presidential elections.@@@It is out of that constant concern to preserve peace, stability and democracy in the Union of the Comoros that I am once again asking for members’ support and assistance in ensuring that the forthcoming presidential and gubernatorial elections, scheduled for December and January, will be held in very favourable conditions.@@@In conclusion.@@@I remain confident that 26 May 2024 will once again commemorate the political maturity of the Comorian people, and that the inauguration ceremony of the next President of the Union of the Comoros will symbolize the anchoring and strength of Comorian democracy.@@@On behalf of myself and the Turkish nation.@@@I would like to salute the members of the General Assembly with my most heartfelt regards.@@@I would like to congratulate Mr. Korosi, who successfully completed his term as President of the General Assembly at its seventy seventh session, and to wish Mr. Francis, who is succeeding him, every success.@@@I hope that the seventy-eighth session of the General Assembly, convened in a spirit of trust and solidarity, will be a blessing for the entire human race.@@@Unfortunately, it is not possible to draw a more optimistic picture of the future of our world than the assessments made from this rostrum last year (see A/77/ PV.4).@@@The picture before us shows that we are facing increasingly complex and dangerous challenges on a global scale.@@@There are conflicts, wars, humanitarian crises, political strife and social tensions to the south, north, east and west of my country.@@@Those growing challenges, compounded by global economic problems, are becoming more and more difficult to deal with.@@@In addition to the humanitarian tragedy, the war on Europe’s eastern borders has created serious problems in all areas, from economy to security and from energy to food supply security.@@@Terrorism, which is used as an instrument of proxy wars in Syria.@@@North Africa and the Sahel region, is causing irreparable damage to the increasingly fragile international security climate.@@@The areas of operation of terrorist organizations, which grow by exploiting the ambitions of global Powers, are spreading like an epidemic across vast geographic areas, taking advantage of technological developments and deteriorating socioeconomic conditions everywhere.@@@The signs of xenophobia, racism and Islamophobia turning into a new crisis have reached alarming levels in the past year.@@@No matter which corner of the world we live in, climate change and related natural disasters have become a reality of our daily lives.@@@On the morning of 6 February.@@@Türkiye faced, in the words of the Secretary-General, “one of the biggest natural disasters in our times”, both in terms of its magnitude and the area it affected.@@@It is impossible for us to forget the sincerity of the international community, including that of the United Nations, in responding urgently to our appeal for help.@@@We will not forget the self-sacrificing efforts and the generous support provided to our country.@@@The friendship shown to our country on that very dark day — on which more than 50.000 people lost their lives.@@@850.000 buildings were destroyed and cities sheltering millions of people were virtually levelled to the ground — was an important source of consolation for us.@@@We have friends from all across the globe from 100 countries.@@@I would like to thank them for the helping hand they so generously extended to us.@@@We have spared no effort in reconstructing our destroyed cities and their buildings.@@@A few days ago.@@@Libya, with which we have strong historical ties, was subjected to heavy destruction and significant loss of life caused by storms and floods.@@@Following the disaster.@@@Türkiye immediately mobilized its resources on behalf of Libya, where 12.000 people lost their lives and thousands are still unaccounted for.@@@In the first phase, we sent three vessels and three aircraft, along with 567 relief personnel, hundreds of vehicles and thousands of tons of food, shelter and sanitary supplies.@@@Our non-governmental organizations are also participating in the relief efforts in that region, with their own resources and capabilities.@@@As a country that stands in solidarity with victimized and oppressed people, wherever they may be in the world, we have not and will not abandon our Libyan brothers and sisters.@@@Hopefully, friendly countries will mobilize to extend a helping hand to Libya
I would also like to wish a rapid recovery to our Moroccan brothers and sisters, who were hit by a very strong earthquake, just like the one we recently experienced.@@@We are pleased to see that this year’s theme of the General Assembly is in line with Türkiye’s goals.@@@The Century of Türkiye, which we started to realize during the 100th anniversary of our republic, is the most concrete expression of that overlapping vision and is one that eliminates global injustices, addresses economic inequalities and promotes peace, security, stability and prosperity in an effective and inclusive way that embraces humanity.@@@In short, it is our call for the establishment of an international system for the benefit of all humankind.@@@This vision is finding ever greater resonance.@@@We agree with Secretary-General Guterres’ recent observation that the institutions established after the Second World War no longer reflect the world of today.@@@That statement expresses our call that “the world is bigger than five”.@@@The Security Council has ceased to be the guarantor of world security and has become a battleground for the political strategies of only five countries.@@@We consider the recent events in Cyprus to be a manifestation of the hollowed-out nature of that institutional structure that no longer inspires justice or trust.@@@As a country that has pioneered numerous initiatives to strengthen peace and stability, we attach great importance to Mr. Guterres’ call for a new agenda for peace.@@@With that understanding, since the beginning of the Russian-Ukrainian war, we have been endeavouring to keep both our Russian and our Ukrainian friends around the table, with the thesis that war will have no winners and peace will have no losers.@@@We will step up our efforts to end the war through diplomacy and dialogue on the basis of Ukraine’s independence and territorial integrity.@@@With the Black Sea Grain Initiative, which we launched together with the United Nations, we prevented the threat of a global hunger crisis by ensuring the delivery of 33 million tons of grain through the Black Sea to global markets.@@@However, the failure to implement that agreement in all its elements has left the world facing a new crisis.@@@That initiative had been extended three times, partly through my efforts.@@@This humanitarian bridge, which extends to countries in dire need, will, we hope, benefit from our arrangements and negotiations.@@@We have a new plan, whereby another 1 million tons of grain will be released to countries in dire need around the world.@@@Our aim is to make the greatest possible contribution to world peace and prosperity in the face of the conflicts around us.@@@The humanitarian tragedy in Syria is now marking its thirteenth year, and it is worsening the living conditions of everyone in the region, regardless of their origin or faith.@@@We are the only country to take a principled, constructive and fair stance against developments that threaten Syria’s political unity, social integrity and economic well-being.@@@It is becoming increasingly important to end the crisis in the south with a comprehensive, lasting and sustainable solution that meets the legitimate expectations of the people.@@@The devastating impact of the 6 February earthquakes, which affected 14 million people in our country, was also deeply felt in Syria, especially in north-western Syria.@@@The already troubled humanitarian situation has only worsened.@@@It is unfortunate that United Nations cross-border humanitarian aid operations in the region were interrupted at such a time.@@@As Türkiye, we will not abandon the more than 4 million people struggling to survive in the north of Syria to their fate and demise.@@@Upon completion of the construction, led by us, of the settlements beyond our borders, we will continue to encourage the return of the refugees in our country to those settlements.@@@However, the biggest threat to Syria’s territorial integrity and political unity is the support given to terrorist organizations, guided by the Powers that have designs on that country.@@@The Syrian people are overwhelmed by the Kurdistan Workers’ Party and Partiya Yekitiya Demokrat terrorist organizations and the radical groups organized on the basis of sectarian divisions.@@@Moreover, different groups have reached the point that it is no longer bearable for the people.@@@As a matter of fact, the various consequences of that have begun to emerge recently.@@@Iraq, another neighbour, is also making sincere efforts to overcome the internal and external challenges it faces.@@@We act with an understanding that strengthens Iraq’s political unity, territorial integrity and reconstruction efforts, and we do not discriminate between the constituent elements of the country.@@@For countries in the region, the path to development will be established so that regional integration will be ensured.@@@The games of those who cling to the Da’esh excuse every time they are in trouble in the region have now been all but exposed.@@@As the leader of a country that has actually fought the greatest battle against Da’esh, inflicted the greatest losses on that organization and knows the realities before and behind the problem.@@@I want to speak very clearly and frankly.@@@We are sick and tired of the hypocrisy of those who use Da’esh and similar organizations as a front for their own political and economic interests in the Middle East.@@@North Africa and the Sahel, but especially in Syria and Iraq.@@@We are tired.@@@The threat in those regions is not confined to Da’esh.@@@The real threat is the terrorist organizations, paramilitary groups, mercenaries and local elements that are used and that are being nurtured as tools in proxy wars, and whoever pays the highest price will use those elements.@@@In spite of that reality, countries that continue to work with terrorist organizations in the service of their own political and economic interests have no right to complain about terrorism and its consequences.@@@In such a world, no one is safe, whether they live right next to a conflict zone or far away, on land surrounded by oceans — nobody can be safe.@@@That is why we say that, under the auspices of the United Nations, we must rapidly restructure the institutions charged with ensuring the security, peace and prosperity of the world.@@@We must build a global governance architecture that is capable of representing all origins, beliefs and cultures in the world with its geography and demography.@@@In conclusion, we say once again with all of our heart, the world is bigger than five, and a fairer world is possible.@@@I would now like to briefly share with the Assembly my country’s approach to various problem areas, starting with our own region.@@@The transformation of the eastern Mediterranean into a sovereign region of peace, prosperity and stability will be possible only if the rights and laws of all parties are respected.@@@We have no eyes on anybody’s rights, and we do not, and will not, let anyone to ignore our rights.@@@This is the sixtieth anniversary of the emergence of the Cyprus question.@@@The Turkish Cypriot side has always made sincere efforts to find a just, lasting and sustainable solution to the Cyprus issue.@@@It is widely accepted that this solution can no longer be realized on the basis of the federation model.@@@We therefore call on the international community to recognize the independence of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus and establish diplomatic, political and economic ties with the country.@@@We also expect the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus to strictly uphold its obligation of impartiality.@@@We would not want the already-discredited Force to face further loss of its credibility in Cyprus.@@@We are making sincere efforts vis-a-vis Yemen.@@@We have strong historical ties with Yemen, and we hope and pray that the issue will be settled once and for all by ensuring unconditional respect for the territorial integrity and unity of that country.@@@Our relations with Egypt were stagnant for a while, but we have recently embarked on a new era, in which relations are developing quite rapidly on the basis of mutual interests and benefits.@@@It is also very important to mention that, in order for peace to prevail in the Middle East, the Palestinian-Israeli conflict should be eventually resolved.@@@We will continue to support the Palestinian people and State, as they struggle to achieve their legitimate rights under international law.@@@It bears repeating that, without the realization of an independent and geographically integrated Palestinian State, based on the 1967 borders, it will be difficult for Israel to achieve the peace and security that it seeks in that part of the world.@@@In that context, we will continue to pursue ensuring respect for the historic status of Jerusalem.@@@We have enjoyed strong political, economic and humanitarian ties with the Balkans throughout history, and we are working hard on bilateral, regional and international platforms to ensure stability in that critical region of Europe and resolve disagreements through dialogue.@@@We actively support the process for the normalization of relations between Kosovo and Serbia, which have been strained recently.@@@The increasingly complex nature of regional and global challenges underlines more than ever the need for relations between Türkiye and the European Union to move forward on a healthy basis.@@@We expect the European Union to quickly begin fulfilling its long-neglected obligations towards our country.@@@In particular, ambivalent attitudes against Türkiye should stop once and for all.@@@Latin America and the Caribbean is another region where we are mobilizing all elements of our humanitarian foreign policy and where our ties of friendship are getting stronger by the day.@@@In the near future, we intend to transform those relations into a Türkiye-Latin America and the Caribbean partnership policy.@@@As we commemorate the sixtieth anniversary of its establishment, the African Union is a monumental symbol for the continent, taking its destiny in its own hands and standing up.@@@The process that started with the will to find African solutions to African problems has turned into one of the most important development projects in the world.@@@To support Africa on that path, we have crowned our ties of friendship with the continent with a strategic partnership.@@@I must once again reiterate, however, that we have welcomed the African Union’s membership in the Group of 20, to which we have attached great importance too.@@@It is a fact that the Sahel faces serious political, economic, social and security challenges.@@@We hope that the Niger, which has recently experienced turbulent times, will restore constitutional order and democratic governance as soon as possible.@@@Any military intervention in the Niger risks plunging that country and the entire region into deeper instability.@@@Our Asia Anew Initiative has become a symbol of our will to further advance our relations with Asia, our ancestral homeland, on the basis of mutual benefit and shared priorities.@@@We have a historic opportunity to build peace, tranquillity and cooperation in the South Caucasus.@@@In order to fully take advantage of that opportunity, we have launched a process with Armenia, aimed at good-neighbourly relations and full normalization.@@@In the same spirit, we have supported the negotiations between Azerbaijan and Armenia from the very beginning.@@@However.@@@Armenia is not taking full advantage of this historic opportunity.@@@We are eager to see a comprehensive peace agreement signed between the two countries, as soon as possible, and promises to be quickly fulfilled, especially the opening of the Zangezur corridor.@@@Karabakh is the territory of Azerbaijan.@@@Any other status imposed will 
never be accepted.@@@Everybody has the right to coexist on Azerbaijani soil, including the Armenians, which should be our primary goal.@@@We are moving together with Azerbaijan under the motto that we are two nations and one State.@@@Efforts to strengthen our cooperation with the countries of Central Asia, with whom we share the same culture and where the roots of our ancient civilization lie, are under way.@@@We are pleased that the Organization of Turkic States is becoming an increasingly effective regional and global actor.@@@The people of Afghanistan, who have undergone difficult times for half a century, are in dire need of humanitarian assistance and support, regardless of political motives.@@@The transformation of the interim Government into an inclusive Administration in which all segments of society are fairly represented will pave the way forward for Afghanistan and will be positively welcomed in the international arena.@@@Another development that will pave the way for regional peace, stability and prosperity in South Asia will be the establishment of a just and lasting peace in Kashmir through dialogue and cooperation between India and Pakistan.@@@Türkiye will continue to support steps taken in that direction.@@@We emphasize at every opportunity that we respect China’s territorial integrity and sovereignty.@@@However, we will continue to express our sensitivity regarding the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of Uyghur Turks with whom we have strong historical and humanitarian ties.@@@We are a country that has extended a helping hand to Rohingya Muslims living in difficult conditions in Myanmar and Bangladesh, since the very beginning.@@@Our support for the displaced Rohingya will continue until their safe, voluntary, dignified and permanent return to their homeland is ensured.@@@Our goal of continuously improving relations with our neighbours, as well as with our friends in more distant locations, is an essential manifestation of our quest to respond more effectively to global challenges.@@@The security of the energy supply is an important issue on the global agenda.@@@We have made considerable investments over the past two decades to be self-sufficient.@@@Energy should no longer be used as an instrument of hostility, but instead should be a vessel for solidarity and cooperation.@@@Within that context, from the Black Sea to the Balkans, from the Caucasus to various parts of the world, we have always prioritized cooperation and solidarity and are striving to do more.@@@In the area of transportation.@@@Türkiye has the geopolitical position to support all projects that pass through or around it.@@@Technological innovation should be seen as an opportunity to solve global and regional challenges, not as a trump card to increase competitiveness.@@@Regrettably, we are gradually moving away from the objective of zero hunger by 2030, which is one of the most important Sustainable Development Goals.@@@Indeed, we find it difficult to accept hunger as an unresolved issue in the twenty-first century.@@@We call on all countries to demonstrate a strong willingness to realize the Sustainable Development Goals, especially in this region, where wealth has skyrocketed.@@@We cannot explain why 735 million of the world’s inhabitants continue to live in dire poverty.@@@Hundreds of millions of dollars are being spent to reach space, but, from Africa to Asia, millions of people cannot even find a decent portion of food to consume.@@@As long as that is the situation, none of us can be safe.@@@As I said before, all countries should demonstrate a strong willing to realize the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@We are one of the most generous countries in the world in terms of development aid, and we have the right to make this appeal.@@@Global climate change is another issue I would like to touch upon.@@@It is becoming increasingly difficult to limit global temperature rise due to climate change to 1.5°C.@@@One of the conditions required for that is financial and technological support for the efforts of developing countries.@@@Food security is one of the main areas affected by climate change.@@@We must develop and implement the right policies and investments for the sustainable use of water and land resources.@@@We cannot bequeath to our children a world plagued by pollution, caused by unconscientious consumption and depleted natural resources.@@@With that understanding, we have taken the zero-waste movement — which we started in our country with the vision of a more liveable and fairer world — and brought it to the world, through a United Nations decision jointly presented by 105 countries, along with my spouse, the First Lady.@@@Yesterday evening, we signed the goodwill declaration on zero waste at the Permanent Mission of Türkiye to the United Nations.@@@We hope that our zero waste targets will contribute to combating climate change and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@I would like to kindly invite all countries, international organizations and non-governmental organizations to support the zero-waste movement globally.@@@The developed countries are suffering from racism as from a plague.@@@They also suffer from xenophobia and Islamophobia.@@@It has become unbearable and has reached intolerable levels.@@@Hate speech, polarization and discrimination against innocent people leave no conscience untouched around the world.@@@Unfortunately, populist politicians in many countries continue to play with fire by encouraging such dangerous trends.@@@The mindset that encourages the heinous attacks against the Holy Qur’an in Europe by allowing them under the guise of freedom of expression is essentially darkening the future of Europe with its own hands.@@@Türkiye will continue to support initiatives to combat Islamophobia on all platforms, including at the United Nations, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation.@@@Regardless of which faith they might follow, no one can accept heinous attacks on holy spaces.@@@I kindly ask all brotherly nations to follow those developments around the world.@@@Combating all those challenges, each of which I have tried to touch upon in a few sentences, is our common responsibility.@@@We can fulfil that responsibility only through effective cooperation and solidarity.@@@We believe that the ancient values that make humans who they are have been recently eroded.@@@Those attacks pose a threat to the prosperity and welfare of the entire world.@@@We have the family at the core of our endeavours, and we must protect and save them.@@@Saving families will mean saving the future of the entire human race.@@@Global impositions are on the rise in unprecedented fashion.@@@That is why I kindly ask all Member States to support and protect the institution of the family.@@@We in the Republic of Türkiye, which celebrates its one-hundredth anniversary this year, will continue to take steps towards peace, prosperity and security for all for the benefit of the entire human race.@@@I hope that the work of the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session will strengthen the spirit of global cooperation and solidarity.@@@I would also like to take this opportunity to mention that the recent incidents between Armenia and Azerbaijan must be condemned and regional developments must be resolved immediately.@@@That is what I hope and pray for.@@@I would once again like to convey greetings, love and respect to all members, and may they remain in good health.@@@The world today is overcome with the overlapping challenges of war, global economic uncertainty, climate change and food insecurity.@@@The cost of war, be it in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the heart of the Sudan, or the war between Russia and Ukraine, has at best led to the displacement of innocent women and children, and at worst led to the demise of many of our brothers and sisters.@@@War has left scars that extend beyond the physical; it wounds the souls of nations and fragments the bonds that hold humankind together.@@@Needless to say, humankind must win the war against war.@@@Neither must we lose the race to save our planet.@@@Destroying our planet is destroying our very own existence.@@@At this seventy-eighth session, we, as a global community, must bolster our commitment towards the implementation of all existing agreements.@@@We need to agree and work towards strengthening global partnerships and good governance that will uphold the dignity and human rights of all people.@@@We must accelerate the attainment of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@We must direct our efforts towards addressing inequalities and realizing a just transition and fostering greater climate action for present and future generations.@@@In this case, a just transition must mean fairness among nations.@@@While we acknowledge that fairness is not about equality.@@@fairness must guarantee the access of each nation to its unique needs.@@@Nations burdened with debt must be guaranteed access to cheaper and fairer financing.@@@That ought to be one of the pillars of restoring trust in our systems.@@@It is therefore imperative that the international financial institutions and multilateral development banks scale up concessional financing to least developed countries, and that financing should be under improved terms of lending.@@@Regrettably, the exorbitant cost of capital remains an insidious problem afflicting the global South.@@@In fact.@@@Africa bears the heaviest burden of those crippling capital costs.@@@We implore the international community to grasp the urgency of that matter and to ensure that every nation, regardless of its economic size, has equitable access to affordable capital.@@@It is a fact that countries with smaller economies are in greater need of the capital that, unfortunately, ends up in first world economies that need it least.@@@We recognize that a few development partners have honoured their pledges of official development assistance, and we applaud them for that effort.@@@We also commend France and other partners for successfully hosting the Summit for a New Global Financing Pact in Paris in June.@@@Zambia further expresses its appreciation to the Creditor Committee of the Group of 20, with a special note of gratitude to the co-Chairs.@@@China and France, along with the Vice-Chair.@@@South Africa.@@@Their diligent work and collaborative spirit played an indispensable role in reaching that important agreement to restructure Zambia’s heavy debt burden.@@@We continue calling for the reform of the international financial architecture to accelerate the decision-making process that would enable countries in special circumstances to restructure debt.@@@We wish to welcome the Secretary-General’s proposal for a Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Stimulus of at least $500 billion per annum to offset the unfavourable financing conditions faced by countries in special situations.@@@The elements of that package hold great potential to catalyse transformative actions in least developed countries in critical sectors such as renewable energy, social protection for the weak, health care, quality education, food security, resilient infrastructure, artificial intelligence (Al) and information technology.@@@There is need to scale up partnerships and collaboration so that we can have a unified effort in strengthening the inclusiveness and effectiveness of international tax cooperation for the world to combat illicit financial flows.@@@It is also important that we enhance the protection of the domestic resources that are required for application to desired sectors, as outlined in the SDG Stimulus proposal.@@@With regard to climate finance, we wish to emphasize the need for an effective implementation mechanism for the Loss and Damage Fund, agreed upon at the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.@@@In the same manner, we reiterate the need to honour the annual $100-billion pledge for climate finance, with greater emphasis on adaptation.@@@That will be very crucial if we are to uphold the credibility of global efforts that are aimed at addressing climate injustices and protecting our planet from further degradation.@@@To complement access to affordable finance, countries need to enhance trade and investment as the engine of economic development and job creation at both the regional and the multilateral levels.@@@Under the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA).@@@Zambia is leading the COMESA integration agenda by reducing barriers to trade and encouraging the free movement of businesspersons and goods.@@@In this era of instant communication and globalized economies, the well-being of one nation profoundly impacts the well-being of another.@@@Leveraging the transformative capabilities of digital technology, especially artificial intelligence, we aspire to enhance the quality of life for our citizens.@@@We need only imagine using Al to deliver lifesaving medicines to a seemingly forgotten grandmother in a village in Africa, or the grand transformation we can achieve in harnessing the fertile soils of countries like Zambia using the technology of precision irrigation.@@@As information communication technologies continue to advance, we have a new frontier for interaction in digital cooperation.@@@Now it is possible for a professor at Harvard to mentor students in Kenya or to deliver a lecture at the University of Lusaka.@@@The advancement in digital technology makes it possible to improve the quality of lives of our people by creating new jobs and opportunities for young people, as well as providing access to top-class education and quality health care for all.@@@It is therefore very important that we continue to forge new alliances in the development and use of technologies, the creation 
and sharing of digital resources and content, and the development of regulations and policies that govern the use of digital technologies to promote social and economic development.@@@We also need to enhance cooperation and ensure that the digital space and technologies are used in a responsible manner.@@@We, therefore, call for support and investment in digital infrastructure, and the provision of access to affordable devices and internet services in under-serviced communities in least developed countries.@@@The empowerment of women and girls is very important in decisively overcoming poverty in our societies.@@@Beyond the economic empowerment of women, we need to equally put greater emphasis on programmes that will promote their well-being.@@@That is why President Hakainde Hichilema, as the African Union Champion on.@@@Ending Child Marriage, will continue to enhance collaboration in preventing and wiping out the scourge of early and child marriages so that we can foster an environment conducive to giving children a chance in life.@@@Consistent with that.@@@Zambia, in collaboration with the African Union, will this year host a conference for traditional and religious leaders across Africa aimed at advancing a culture that promotes inclusive development and the prevention of early and child marriages.@@@Zambia, in line with our reputation as a beacon of peace on the African continent, will continue to champion the cause of peace, security and stability as prerequisites for sustainable development.@@@Without peace, our joint development efforts will be in vain.@@@We shall continue to call for the use of diplomacy as the only option for resolving conflict between nations.@@@Zambia is committed to furthering peace, security and stability, and that President Hichilema visited Kyiv and St. Petersburg, alongside other select African leaders, and held honest and constructive discussions with both President Putin and President Zelenskyy.@@@Zambia will continue to be committed to the Charter of the United Nations and its principles of upholding territorial integrity and just respect for international borders.@@@As Zambia leads the Southern African Development Community Organ on Politics.@@@Defence and Security Cooperation, we pledge not only to play our individual role, but also to galvanize regional efforts to restore peace in the areas requiring intervention on our continent.@@@We take immense pride in our strong democratic credentials, and we will continue to guarantee the Zambian people their rights and freedoms, including their civil liberties.@@@President Hichilema has led his Government to the historic abolishment of the death penalty and of the offence of criminal defamation of the President.@@@That is the first time this has been achieved in the history of Zambia.@@@Today we address the Assembly with a sense of accomplishment, because prudent fiscal policies have been reinstated in our country.@@@We are nurturing our economy back to health, and the results are quantifiable.@@@In 2021, our economy achieved a commendable growth rate of 4.7 per cent following a contraction of 2.8 per cent in 2020.@@@In 2022, the economy demonstrated resilience and maintained a positive growth of 3.7 per cent.@@@Furthermore, we have diligently worked to reduce year- end inflation to single digits, making it at 9.9 per cent for the calendar year 2022.@@@Concurrently, our Government is deeply committed to stabilizing the exchange rate of the local currency, the Zambian kwacha, against major currencies.@@@Going forward, we will remain steadfast in reducing the cost of essential household goods for our people.@@@Zambia reiterates the call to reform the Security Council to make it more inclusive, and particularly for Africa to have permanent representation, in line with the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration.@@@Those reforms will not only enhance the legitimacy of the Security Council, but put an end to that historic injustice against Africa.@@@The time has come to ensure the true composition of our United Nations family, as well as to create an opportunity for a better diplomatic position and representation for countries that are perceived to be weaker.@@@The threat of nuclear warfare is a matter that needs our full attention.@@@We take this opportunity to reiterate our resolute stance against the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and we advocate for a world free of nuclear threats.@@@We urge all nations — and we mean all nations — to uphold their obligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to work to prevent the development and production of chemical weapons.@@@We have set our eyes on an agenda to put the world on a path of sustainability and success for the next generation.@@@We are hopeful that all our voices will be heard at the Summit of the Future next year.@@@We shall rebuild trust in this forum.@@@A platform such as ours must ensure that inequality and systemic injustice are tackled and that the benefits of progress are shared 
across the world.@@@Zambia therefore calls on all States Members of the United Nations, the private sector, youth groups across the world and other stakeholders to come together in good faith to draw out the contours of the world as it should be for future generations as we pass the baton on all the challenges we face today for a sustainable and positive future.@@@On behalf of the people and the Government of the Sudan.@@@I would like to congratulate the President on assuming the presidency of General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session.@@@I also thank the President of the Assembly at 
its seventy-seventh session and the Secretary-General for their efforts in confronting the challenges that have faced the world over the past year.@@@Since 15 April, the Sudanese people have been facing a devastating war launched by the rebel Rapid Support Forces, which have been allied with tribal, regional and international militias, bringing in mercenaries from various parts of the world to perpetrate the most heinous crimes against the Sudanese people.@@@Those rebel groups have committed murder, looting, theft and rape and have seized citizens’ homes and property.@@@They have destroyed civilian objects, including public facilities, hospitals and State and government buildings.@@@They have attempted to obliterate the history and identity of the Sudanese people by attacking museums and archaeological sites and destroying land records, civil registries and court registries.@@@They have plundered banks and private and public corporations.@@@They have released prisoners and detainees, including those wanted by international justice mechanisms, and terrorists.@@@Those rebel groups have committed crimes against humanity and war crimes in most parts of the Sudan.@@@They have carried out ethnic cleansing, forced displacements, sexual violence, race-based killings, torture and many other acts that amount to war crimes, in Darfur and Khartoum.@@@What happened in West Darfur in El Geneina was a shock to the global conscience, as was what happened in Tawila.@@@Mornei.@@@Menawashei and even Khartoum.@@@It was a testimony of the acts of those forces and their allied groups.@@@We call on the President and the international community to designate those forces and the groups allied with them as terrorist groups that must be countered by all and must be fought to protect the Sudanese people, the region and the entire world.@@@They are responsible for the killing of thousands of people and the displacement of millions.@@@Despite what has been committed by those groups, since their attack against the State, we have done our utmost to put an end to this war.@@@We have responded to each and every initiative of our brothers and friends.@@@We attended a meeting in Jeddah at the invitation of our brothers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and of the United States of America.@@@We would have made considerable progress if it were not for the intransigence of the rebels who refused to withdraw from inhabited neighbourhoods.@@@We also accepted the initiative of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development and that of neighbouring countries held in Egypt.@@@To this day, we continue to extend a hand of peace to put an end to this war and to alleviate the suffering of our people.@@@We have also accepted the initiative of our brothers in Türkiye and South Sudan, as well as Uganda, aimed at finding solutions.@@@However, they were all confronted by the rebels’ refusal to seek a peaceful solution and their insistence on destroying the State and committing genocide against the people.@@@Some characterize this war as an internal war between two armed parties.@@@However, the aggression was not against only the armed forces rather it extended to all parts of the State.@@@Innocent citizens are not part of the armed forces.@@@The people in West Darfur are not part of the armed forces.@@@Our citizens’ homes are not part of the armed forces.@@@Therefore, this war cannot be characterized as a war between the armed forces and the Rapid Support Forces.@@@Instead, it extends to all constituents of the State.@@@Nevertheless.@@@I would like to confirm that the war is now a threat to regional and international peace and security, as those rebels have sought the support of outlaws and terrorist groups from different countries in the region and the world.@@@That is like a spark of war, a war that will spill over to other countries in the region.@@@The regional and international interference in support of those groups is crystal clear by now.@@@In other words, that is the spark that will ignite the region and will have a direct impact on international peace and security.@@@I would like to express my thanks for the efforts of the United Nations and the Secretary-General aimed at supporting the humanitarian situation in the Sudan.@@@We also appreciate all efforts made by the various United Nations agencies and other regional and international agencies, along with the efforts of the sisterly and friendly countries that have provided humanitarian assistance to the Sudan.@@@They have stood by the Sudanese people to alleviate the repercussions of this criminal war.@@@For its part, the Government of the Sudan has opened airports and seaports and facilitated the movement and transit of convoys.@@@It has attempted to remove all obstacles to humanitarian action.@@@We have coordinated all efforts so that assistance can reach all those in need and affected.@@@In that regard, we call on 
all agencies and countries to meet their pledges to fill the huge gap in food, medicine and shelter which has affected huge segments of our population, those who have been affected by this war launched by the rebels of the Rapid Support Forces under the command of Abdelrahim Hamdan Dagalo.@@@We remain committed to our previous pledges to transfer power to the people of the Sudan with broad national consensus and consent.@@@In that regard, the armed forces will leave politics once and for all and the transfer of power will then be the result of a peaceful and legitimate process of elections.@@@However, we see a short transitional period in which the country will be governed by a civil Government consisting of independents.@@@During that period, they can address security, humanitarian and economic matters and reconstruction.@@@Then, general elections will be held so that the Sudanese people can choose their leaders.@@@We stress that the State is committed to continuing dialogue with all those who have abstained in the dialogue, our brothers Abdelaziz Al-Hilu and Abdel Wahid Al-Nur, so that they can join the march towards national statehood.@@@We are fully committed to the Juba Peace Agreement, signed in Juba in 2020.@@@We have made great strides in bringing about peace and addressing the many obstacles facing the Sudanese statehood.@@@I would like to reiterate the Sudan’s commitment to supporting women and children and vulnerable segments of our society, so that they can enjoy all their rights, and to protecting them in the light of the ongoing disputes.@@@We reiterate the commitment of the Sudanese Government to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@In that regard, the halting or freezing of international and humanitarian assistance over the past period negatively affected the implementation of those Goals.@@@It had a direct impact on widening the gap in social protection and countering climate change and the food crisis.@@@It has exacerbated the situation of refugees and displaced persons.@@@We therefore call on donors and various relief agencies to continue supporting and addressing the humanitarian situation in the Sudan by providing assistance to those in need, especially refugees and displaced persons.@@@Before I conclude.@@@I would like to reiterate our demand to designate the rebel Rapid Support Forces and their allied militias as terrorist groups, for they have committed all sorts of crimes that provide grounds for such designation.@@@There is a need to firmly respond to their sponsors who have supported acts of killing, burning, rape, forced displacement, looting, stealing and torture; arms and drug trafficking; the use of mercenaries and the recruitment of children, all crimes that demand accountability and punishment.@@@I would also like to reiterate that legitimate State institutions — be they the Government, the armed forces or other bodies — will never allow any violation of the State’s sovereignty or the humiliation of the Sudanese people at any cost.@@@I have to recall the need for our regional organizations to free themselves from guardianship and support the interests of the African peoples so that they can regain the trust of Africans.@@@We will not allow others to find solutions to our problems according to their own interests.@@@In conclusion.@@@I would like to thank you.@@@Mr. President, and thank His Excellency the Secretary- General for understanding our domestic issues, for standing by the people of the Sudan and for their continued support to them.@@@I would also like to thank our neighbouring countries and our brothers and friends who have stood beside us.@@@We would also like to thank the regional organizations.@@@The people of the Sudan thank them all for their support in surmounting this crisis and the barbaric attack launched by the criminals of the rebel Rapid Support Forces.@@@I would like to seize this opportunity to express the solidarity of the Sudanese people with our brothers in Morocco and Libya following the disasters they have faced recently.@@@I would also like to thank all the people of the Sudan who have stood by us, supported us and borne with us over the past few months all the sacrifices in order to eradicate the rebel terrorist groups.@@@Brother Vice-President of the General Assembly.@@@Diego Pary Rodriguez, it is a source of joy and pride for Bolivia to see you lead the General Assembly of the most important multilateral Organization created by humankind, and we are sure that, together with President Dennis Francis and his leadership, you will elevate the names of the countries of our Latin American and Caribbean region.@@@A year ago in this forum (see A/77/PV.5), we denounced the fact that the world was facing a capitalist crisis that put humankind and the very existence of the planet at risk.@@@Unfortunately, a year after that declaration, that sensitive scenario has not changed.@@@The capitalist system, in its eagerness to impose its decadent hegemony, replicates practices of colonial domination and exploitation that should already have been overcome.@@@Unfortunately, many of the brilliant proposals that have emerged from the heart of the Assembly have been ignored or simply omitted, owing to the functional interests of the savage system of capitalist exploitation that prioritizes the production and reproduction of capital, rather than safeguarding the lives of human beings and the existence of the planet.@@@It is evident that we are facing a weakened economy due to the effects of the multiple armed conflicts that are currently shaking the world and our reality.@@@Peace and security are at imminent risk due to the lack of will of the international community to propose solutions that privilege dialogue and put an end to the belligerent efforts promoted by transnational war corporations.@@@Added to this are the serious effects of the ecological crisis on life systems in all corners of the world.@@@According to experts, due to the prevailing system, we have exceeded six of the nine planetary limits within which humanity and Mother Earth as a whole can continue to develop and prosper.@@@It is worth highlighting that this tragic situation has deteriorated even further over the recent decades of unipolarity and unilaterality, of inaction and unfulfilled commitments.@@@The pending challenges remain numerous and enormous, but today we find ourselves at the dawn of a new international configuration.@@@We are convinced that we are witnessing the construction of a new world order, a situation in which the General Assembly, in accordance with the principles by which it was created, must play a main role; a new world order in which we all participate with equal rights and obligations, without impositions of any kind, without masters or slaves, without double standards to measure one another, without sanctioners or sanctioned; a new order in which solidarity, complementation and collaboration are set above selfishness and meanness.@@@In the certainty that this better world is possible and necessary, the Plurinational State of Bolivia wishes to share the following seven ideas and approaches:@@@First, we reiterate, as we did last year, our proposal that the world be declared a territory of peace.@@@We must put an end once and for all to the arms race and prioritize sincere dialogue and peoples’ diplomacy to resolve the armed conflicts that threaten the existence of humankind.@@@It is urgent that our nations join together in a collective effort with diverse voices, especially those that come from regions far from confrontational rhetoric and that nevertheless suffer the repercussions of war in its various dimensions.@@@We must give peace a chance, and in that task the United Nations has a fundamental role to play in reducing tensions and advancing dialogues that allow us to consolidate political and diplomatic solutions to the conflicts on the agenda of our Organization.@@@In that order of ideas, we reiterate our deep concern about the escalation of violence in the conflict in Eastern Europe and the threat emanating from several countries to exacerbate the situation through a confrontation using weapons of mass destruction, weapons that incorporate depleted radioactive elements and unconventional weapons, which are prohibited by international law through various binding international instruments.@@@We see with great concern that military spending in the world has reached historic heights.@@@As of April, the world had invested more than $2.24 trillion in weapons and the war industry.@@@If those resources were invested in peace, mediation, dialogue, the development of peoples and life instead of in destruction and death, we would not find ourselves on the brink of a crisis that amplifies inequalities in the world and which, contrary to the objectives that we have set in this Hall, deepens poverty on the planet.@@@The ways and means of waging war cannot be unlimited.@@@A growing number of countries are seeking to use outer space to improve their military capabilities in order to protect their national security, further endangering the peace and security of our planet.@@@We deeply regret that the maintenance of peace and security has become an increasingly challenging goal.@@@Genuine peace can be achieved only through the effective implementation of the mechanisms provided for in the Charter of the United Nations and the complete elimination of all types of weapons.@@@Bolivia will always be committed to defending and strengthening multilateralism and to continuing to contribute to disarmament in compliance with international law and international humanitarian law, based on a vision focused on peace with social justice, the well-being of people and peaceful coexistence. .@@@We reiterate our regional commitment by proclaiming Latin America and the Caribbean a zone of peace, based on the promotion and respect for the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law, as we set out in the framework of the seventh Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC).@@@Likewise, at the CELAC-European Union Summit held in Brussels in July, we expressed our desire for a peaceful Latin America.@@@Caribbean and Europe.@@@May our peoples achieve the peace that the capitalist model has not been able to offer them, abandoning practices that, historically, have not resulted in an equitable and complementary relationship between our regions.@@@Second, it is necessary to break as soon as possible with the unjust international order that overwhelms our people, to sit down now to debate within the framework of the United Nations and to build a new pact for the future.@@@In Bolivia, we have begun to discuss the possibility of a new pact for the future, but to do so we must remember the past, resolve the present and prepare for the future.@@@We are obliged to address the needs of present and future generations equitably.@@@We cannot allow a child to die of hunger today to ensure a snack for another child who has not yet been born.@@@Eliminating poverty and inequalities today will prevent unimaginable economic and ecological distribution conflicts in the future.@@@To rebuild trust we need to abandon petty interests and build reciprocity, for example by enabling all technology transfer that helps to save lives and restore Mother Earth.@@@To revive global solidarity, we need to recognize ourselves in each other and repair our relationships as human beings.@@@For example, in the context of climate change, let us agree that each State shall dedicate resources to the Loss and Damage Fund in proportion to its historical responsibility for greenhouse gases.@@@Action on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development can be accelerated if we make peace and solidarity the engine of prosperity.@@@Let us dare to transform the expenses of war and death into investments for life.@@@With those resources, the sustainable development objectives could be far exceeded.@@@Likewise, we will be able to keep Mother Earth within a safe operating space for humankind only if sustainability with ecological and social justice becomes the only path to progress.@@@But we must achieve those objectives in a fair and equitable manner, with everyone and for everyone, and without political or financial impositions.@@@Third, it is necessary and urgent to change the capitalist system in times of neoliberalism, which multiplies and reproduces the forms of domination, exploitation and exclusion of the great majorities.@@@The multidimensional crisis of capitalism has been exposed in the post-pandemic context and exacerbated by the effects of the military conflict in Eastern Europe.@@@Those are nothing more than expressions of the transition towards the configuration of a world order different from the current one.@@@In response, and as has never happened before, the global South is rising peacefully and constructively through regional and interregional processes of cooperation and integration.@@@We are hearing a rising call to reconfigure the international financial system and transform our understanding of what scientific development, respectful of Mother Earth, should be and how to pursue it equitably, recognizing the respective historical responsibilities of our nations in all dimensions.@@@Given the irreversible march towards a multipolar world, the increasingly stronger influence of new initiatives of economic, commercial integration and cooperation between countries is undeniable.@@@The emergence of trade blocs such as those in Asia.@@@Africa.@@@South America or the BRICS countries Brazil.@@@Russia.@@@India.@@@China and South Africa, today allows nations to access international markets without the need to compromise their sovereignty.@@@In that context, despite an adverse international context.@@@Bolivia has developed its Economic and Social Development Plan 2021-2025.@@@“Rebuilding the Economy to Live Well.@@@Towards Industrialization with Import Substitution”, which lays the foundations to confront the global economic crisis and develop public policies to strengthen the national economy and promote our development capabilities.@@@In that regard, the actions taken for the economic and reproductive reconstruction of our economy exceeded 6 per cent in 2021, and in 2022 reached 3.5 per cent.@@@Our nominal gross domestic product (GDP) increased from $40,703 billion in 2021 to $44,315 billion in 2022, the highest figure in our history.@@@In the same way.@@@GDP per capita increased by 7.4 per cent compared to the 2021 figure, reaching $3,691, which was also the highest figure in the history of our country.@@@I also note that so far this year, accumulated inflation is only 1.6 per cent, the lowest figure in our region and with respect to many countries of the planet.@@@We have achieved that indicator without raising interest rates, without practicing neoliberal monetary policies and always taking care of the pockets of the poorest, which is where inflation hurts the most.@@@The achievements of our country are based mainly on the civilizational concept of living well, which vindicates the culture of community life in fullness, respecting the coexistence in harmony, balance and complementarity of the human being with the rest of nature on Mother Earth.@@@Fourth, the climate crisis requires concrete actions and renewed commitments.@@@Bolivia proposed the recognition of Mother Earth in the General Assembly through resolution 63/278, adopted on 22 April 2009, in an effort to ensure that we, as an international community, became aware of the importance of restoring natural processes for the survival of human beings, proposing an alternative, anti-colonial vision against capitalism and mercantilism.@@@In that understanding, our vision for the sustainability of development has strong roots in our vision of living well and in harmony with nature.@@@That vision is born from the ancient and ancestral thinking of the nations and indigenous peoples who constitute the basis of our plurinationality.@@@Regarding the needs for mitigation, adaptation to the climate crisis and growing losses and damages, it is important that all countries shoulder their responsibilities.@@@In that framework, the developed countries must assume their corresponding share of the climate debt and compensation and historical reparations to developing countries.@@@The first step towards that end is to fulfil outstanding commitments on the provision of financing, technology transfer and capacity development.@@@In that global problem, there is a common problem that is beginning to take its toll on the poorest countries: water scarcity and the increase in the evaporation rate of fresh water.@@@We urge our Assembly to pay unflagging attention to that problem, which mainly affects the poorest of the five continents and is already beginning to affect social sectors that are not found in the conventional frameworks of poverty.@@@Bolivia highlights the fact that this year the High Seas Treaty on marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction was concluded and adopted by consensus because it represents a significant step towards the protection of our oceans and the sustainable use of their resources, greatly benefiting developing countries and especially landlocked developing countries.@@@The Treaty will establish rules and regulations to prevent the sustainable exploitation of resources, which will protect the interests of landlocked countries and prevent the depletion of marine resources.@@@The Treaty is a historic opportunity to make a difference in the protection of our oceans, because they constitute a common good of humankind.@@@In that context, we highlight the special mention of indigenous peoples and landlocked developing countries.@@@Together, we can ensure that the oceans continue to provide life and prosperity for present and future generations in an equitable manner.@@@Fifth, we must continue promoting a broader view of rights humans and democracy.@@@Despite the progress achieved, the world remains unequal.@@@While it is true that people build their own destiny, it is also true that the well-being of our peoples has been undermined for centuries by legal, economic and ideological colonialism.@@@Representatives here know better than I do that it has not been possible to exercise the right to development due to a matter of historical magnitude.@@@The systematic transfer of wealth from the South to the North has put us at a disadvantage to this day.@@@We have had to navigate the gale of a crisis imposed only on the South.@@@From that perspective, talk of economic, social and cultural human rights — such as the rights to health, education, food, access to knowledge and technologies — is different on one continent than it is on another, in the South or in the North.@@@In that context, it is not possible to plan without addressing historical responsibilities.@@@Unless we do so, it will be impossible to reach our full potential as peoples and make our right to development possible.@@@In the Plurinational State of Bolivia, we understand that no democracy is possible without development, and development cannot have a better indicator than the exercise of collective rights, promoted, protected and guaranteed by the State, but also combined with a high democratic participation of social groups.@@@In Bolivia we understand that economic stability also means a substantive change in favour of food sovereignty, access to intercultural and multilingual education, and the sexual and reproductive health of Bolivian women.@@@From our experience.@@@I want to highlight that the active participation of indigenous peoples in State affairs is what has made our recent achievements possible, and I therefore call on the Assembly to continue advancing in strengthening their rights and participation.@@@Another topic of special interest to my country is women’s rights.@@@It is estimated that 736 million women in the world — that is, one in every three women — have been subjected to physical violence and/ or sexual violence.@@@The violence suffered by women must stop being a solitary and private experience and be recognized as a public issue concerning which we must take urgent action.@@@Maternal mortality is another of the major problems that we must face, given that 800 women die every day from causes related to pregnancy.@@@Sustainable development will not be possible if we do not give women the opportunity to live without fear of violence and to exercise their sexual and reproductive rights with access to universal health services.@@@Sixth, we must banish the implementation of sanctions and unilateral coercive measures from the international system.@@@Another issue that I cannot fail to mention on this occasion is related to the unilateral coercive measures and sanctions that are applied to brother peoples, undermining their development and most basic human rights.@@@Such measures are an example of a dysfunctional system alienated from international law and multilateralism.@@@A clear example of such measures is the illegal, inhuman and criminal economic and financial blockade imposed by the United States against Cuba.@@@The restrictions imposed have made it difficult for Cubans to access food, medicine and other 
basic goods, generating human suffering and impacting their economy and development.@@@We call for compliance with the multiple resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and to build a more just and supportive world in which all countries can prosper regardless of their political differences.@@@Likewise, we reject and condemn the inclusion of Cuba as a promoter of terrorism within the unilateral lists of the United States, using that argument to impose greater restrictive measures against the Cuban people.@@@Those measures are contrary to the Charter of the United Nations and the mandate of the Security Council, and they therefore have no support or validity in the light of international law; worse still, they seriously affect the right to development of the Cuban people.@@@Seventh, let us stop the abuse of the Palestinian people as soon as possible.@@@Regarding Israel’s occupation of Palestine, we cannot continue to allow the suffering of the Palestinian people.@@@We reiterate our support for global and regional initiatives, international law and United Nations resolutions that seek to guarantee a solution whereby the Palestinian people can exercise their right to self-determination and build their own free, independent and sovereign State within its pre-1967 borders and with East Jerusalem as its capital.@@@Finally, the current crisis demands a strong United Nations consistent with the principles that created it and committed to peace; a United Nations that maintains its intergovernmental character but without subordination to any hegemonic Power, be it economic, political or military.@@@The solutions to the multiple challenges facing humankind will become a reality only with the genuine commitment and political will of all countries and their actors, prioritizing the common interest of humankind, the peoples and the most vulnerable sectors of society.@@@My warmest greetings and congratulations go to Mr. Dennis Francis on his election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session.@@@I take this opportunity to commit my delegation’s fullest support for and cooperation with him and his Office as we work towards the fulfilment of the four priority areas that he has identified: peace, prosperity, progress and sustainability, all of which I also view as important areas in this challenging and dynamic global agenda.@@@I also commend and thank his predecessor.@@@His Excellency Csaba Korosi of Hungary, for his leadership and guidance of the previous session of the General Assembly.@@@It is my privilege to once again speak from this centre rostrum from which one year ago I addressed the Assembly for the very first time as Prime Minister.@@@It was exactly 15 months ago when the people of Grenada.@@@Carriacou and Petite Martinique, exercising their democratic right through free and fair elections, voted my Government into office on a transformation agenda that promised to bring about fundamental change that would have a discernible and positive effect on the daily lives of all our citizens.@@@So here we are, exactly one year removed from my own inaugural address to the Assembly, against the backdrop of this year’s seventy-eighth session’s theme of “Rebuilding trust and reigniting global solidarity: accelerating action on the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals towards peace, prosperity, progress and sustainability for all”.@@@But what does this all mean when we continue to live in a global environment and context in which our citizens are still plagued with issues such as hunger, poverty, gender-based violence, climate-related disasters and other such issues that affect our planet, especially those that touch on and concern such aspirations as the achievement of all 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)?@@@Against that backdrop.@@@I am pleased to take this opportunity to announce that Grenada will soon be celebrating its fiftieth anniversary of national independence, on 7 February 2024.@@@In that regard, it could not be a more fitting occasion for my Government and our citizens to not only celebrate the upcoming jubilee milestone but also to take the occasion to reflect on and look ahead with respect to Grenada’s continued role in the United Nations, where we must have a reimagined and renewed commitment to upholding the fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law.@@@Looking ahead, particularly in a post-pandemic world, we can report that Grenada, like many others, was not spared the devastating and blunt-force trauma effects of the coronavirus disease pandemic coming to our shores, which took a deadly toll, resulting through the loss of many of the lives of our citizens in our Spice Island.@@@Still, and notwithstanding the many traumatic experiences of that period, which saw the tragic loss of lives, lockdowns, mandates and, ultimately, some relief through the development and administration of vaccines; the resilience of the Grenadian people rang through and, ultimately, we prevailed as a people against an invisible enemy that during its reign took the lives of those whom we knew and called family, friends and loved ones.@@@But we as a people survived.@@@In that regard, and as the world and international community continue on their way to recovery and rebuilding, and as Grenada reflects on that particular experience, it would be remiss of me if I did not emphasize and remind us all of how important it is to have international cooperation, along with the sharing of resources and information and continued dialogue through such multilateral forums as the one in which we find ourselves gathered here today.@@@To that end, it cannot be overstated how much these last three years have allowed us to, hopefully, learn from tragedy and adversity as seen during the crisis of the pandemic.@@@We all must never forget that whenever and wherever there are severe challenges and especially human suffering, the United Nations and its Members must come together and respond to such crises with the greatest urgency through its multilateral efforts and cooperation, so that we can all come together in aid of our neighbours and citizens in their time of need.@@@In that regard, and as Grenada looks towards to its future and casts its eyes upon its own embrace of its goals and pursuits, with hopes of achieving all 17 SDGs.@@@I am pleased to highlight and speak briefly on SDG 4: quality education.@@@On that front.@@@Grenada, under my Government’s leadership, has made significant advancements in improving access to quality education for all citizens of Grenada.@@@Also, to ensure that no one is left behind, our premier community college for youth exiting the secondary school system in Grenada, the T.A. Marry show Community College, has implemented the Skills to Access the Green Economy Programme, in partnership with a significant member of this body, to allow many of our youth to receive job-related education and training in a variety of identified vocational disciplines.@@@Additionally, my Government has developed and commenced a free tuition policy that allows all students access to a post-secondary-school and tertiary-level education at no tuition cost to them, as part of our commitment to providing a good-quality education to as broad a cross-section of our student and wider population as possible.@@@Grenada can also speak to its engagement and implementation work with respect to SDG 5 and the very important issue of gender equality.@@@In that regard, my Government continues to make numerous advancements towards achieving gender equality, including, but not limited to, having gender themes reflected in several policy frameworks, including our medium-term action plan.@@@We have implemented the Spotlight Initiative, which aims to end violence against women and girls and which highlights the all-of-society approach required to advance the attainment of this very important SDG 5.@@@This initiative has come with the assistance of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), which we thank, and which is designed to focus attention, coordinate human effort and strategically apply resources to the implementation of a well- conceived comprehensive national programme to contribute to ending family violence and all forms of violence against women and girls in Grenada.@@@Carriacou and Petite Martinique.@@@With respect to SDG 8, on decent work and economic growth for our citizens, given what we saw and experienced during the pandemic and now in the post-pandemic world, where there were disruptions to supply chains, economic inflation and recession in many areas, we acknowledge and recognize that our unemployment rates remain a challenge and that there remains much work to be done.@@@Notwithstanding that.@@@Grenada has sought to mitigate those harsh realities and push back against those shocks, with several projects being implemented, including our Land Bank Project, the Grenada Climate Resilient Water Sector project and the UNDP climate resilience in agriculture programme.@@@Those initiatives and projects have served as critical activity areas that have created many forms 
of employment for our citizens, especially our young people, giving them a renewed sense of hope that they, too, can have equal access to employment and economic opportunities.@@@Looking further, and as another example, on Goal 14, life below water.@@@Grenada understands all too well how important our oceans are to countries like Grenada that are big ocean States and where many of our citizens, especially the fishing community, depend heavily on the ocean for their daily sustenance and livelihoods.@@@As such, my Government has embarked on the Fiscal Resilience and Blue Growth Development Policy Credit project, which is aimed at giving support to Grenada’s transition to a blue economy.
Additionally.@@@Grenada has embarked on the creation of additional marine protected areas as well as legislative and policy frameworks, including the Integrated Coastal Zone Management Policy.@@@Those are all geared towards protecting the integrity of our island and lending support to the management of its marine areas.@@@I now turn to SDG 15, concerning life on land.@@@With a ratio of forest to total land of only 35 per cent.@@@Grenada has made progress with the measures that we have taken to protect our forests.@@@Our forest policy provides an overarching framework to ensure the resilience and sustainability of that finite and precious green resource through a number of strategic directions.@@@That leads me to SDG 17, which is perhaps equally important, on partnerships for the Goals.@@@In that regard.@@@I am pleased to state that multi-stakeholder partnerships have proved invaluable for us and have paved the way for the advancement of the SDGs in Grenada, as stakeholders recognize the need for an all-of-Government and all- of-society approach to advancing our progress towards sustainable development.@@@Finally, allow me to further address the one subject that is arguably the most all-encompassing and predominant issue of our time.@@@It relates to SDG 13, concerning climate action.@@@We, the leaders of the 193 States Members of our Organization, gather here in New York every year to provide updates through our own lenses on the progress we have made in our countries and the future that we would like to see, reflecting the views of the various regions of the international community.@@@In that context, if there is one thing that we can all be certain of, it is the likelihood of a climate disaster of some kind occurring in one or several of our Member States, with devastating impacts on their citizens and economies and inevitable effects on the state and progress of those countries’ development.@@@Last year I called for accelerating the urgent task that our community of nations needs to focus on by redoubling our efforts on climate action (see A/77/PV.12).@@@In that regard, this year’s Climate Ambition Summit was an opportunity for Government leaders and other partners to present credible and concrete action aimed at keeping the 1.5°C goal of the Paris Agreement alive and deliver justice to those on the front lines of the climate crisis.@@@The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has confirmed that global emissions are at their highest levels in human history and are only continuing to rise.@@@Those increases will continue to wreak havoc on communities, economies and businesses and create a severe strain on public finances.@@@The States that contribute the least to the climate crisis are the ones bearing the heaviest burden, and without immediate and deep emissions cuts across the board.@@@I am afraid that we are on a trajectory to far worse outcomes if we do not take significant action today.@@@As we look forward to the upcoming twenty-eighth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, my own region and fellow Caribbean Community (CARICOM) Heads of Government have emphasized the critical importance of making urgent efforts to address financing aimed at tackling the impact of climate change.@@@Those Heads of Government have also agreed on the need for strong political advocacy from the region on key areas for action to keep the 1.5°C temperature goal within reach, focusing on finance for adaptation, loss and damage, improving access to financing for small island developing States, de-risking, debt sustainability and innovation.@@@Grenada shares the concerns about those important issues and continues to remain vulnerable to our harsh climate crisis and its devastating effects.@@@Grenada has implemented several policy frameworks, such as its national climate change policy and national adaptation plan, geared to assisting in advancing our strategic approach to climate adaptation and building resilience.@@@Our adaptation efforts will be scaled up through initiatives such as our climate-smart agriculture programme and our second nationally determined contribution, which has set an emission-reduction target of 40 per cent below 2010 levels.@@@Against that 
backdrop and further to our own efforts in Grenada, in my address to the Assembly last year I said.@@@“I call on all young people to take action.@@@It is not yet too late to do what is necessary to safeguard our planet for future generations, but the time for action is now.@@@[We cannot continue to pay lip service to climate change when climate change is showing us every day what it is capable of doing.@@@]@@@The reality is that the leaders of today will not be around to feel the consequences of their decisions.@@@It is therefore up to our youth to lead the charge for the future they want to see” (A/77/PV.12, p. 14).@@@That remains as true today as it was last year, and it will remain true for many years to come.@@@Today I am making a further clarion call to all Member States, through their leaders and high-level representatives, to take decisive action and do what is necessary to safeguard our planet for future generations — but the time for such action is now.@@@Now is the time for global leaders to follow through on the commitments they have made at the multilateral level.@@@Our goal as responsible global citizens should be to leave this planet in as good a condition as we found it, if not much better.@@@Finally, on issues concerning the countries of the Caribbean archipelago that are part of the global South, conscious of the President’s first priority pillar of his presidency — that of peace — we renew our call for the Caribbean region to remain a zone of peace and an environment that contributes to facilitating the social, economic and environmental development of all Caribbean States and the world at large.@@@In that regard, and in the light of the recently concluded successful summit of the Group of 77 and China, held in Havana.@@@Grenada reiterates its call for the removal of the economic, commercial and financial blockade imposed by the United States on Cuba, for Cuba to be removed from the United States State Department’s list of countries that are co-sponsors of terrorism and for it to be recognized once again among the peace-loving nations of the international community.@@@With regard to another issue in our Caribbean community.@@@Grenada remains deeply concerned and must also raise awareness about the deteriorating situation of the rule of law in Haiti and the very troubling escalation of violence in our fellow CARICOM member State.@@@The urgent support of the international community needs to be ramped up, in particular in the humanitarian and security areas, where the needs are greatest.@@@The need for robust security assistance to counter the rampaging armed gangs is clear, yet the decision to enable it is meandering slowly through the Security Council.@@@CARICOM welcomes the Government of Kenya’s willingness to lead such a multinational force and the offers of support and contributions of personnel from Rwanda, the Bahamas and Jamaica.@@@The Caribbean Community hopes that the establishment of the multinational force will be endorsed by the Security Council as a demonstration of the international community’s commitment to supporting the restoration of law and order and improving humanitarian conditions for the people of Haiti.@@@Inter-Haitian dialogue is key to any progress in addressing the multifaceted crisis.@@@For its part.@@@CARICOM is facilitating those efforts by providing its good offices through a group of eminent persons consisting of three former Prime Ministers of the region.@@@A resolution of the political crisis in Haiti is also key to enabling the free and fair elections that are needed to put the country back on a constitutional path and open the door to an improved future for its citizens.@@@The people of Haiti deserve no less.@@@In that regard.@@@Grenada calls on all friends of Haiti and on the Secretary-General to continue to use their good offices to support the people of Haiti.@@@With respect to Venezuela, we further reiterate and remain resolute in our call for an end to the imposition on that country of unilateral coercive measures, which are contrary to the rules and principles of international law and the Charter of the United Nations.@@@In conclusion, with a challenging and complex yet dynamic global agenda, it is still incumbent on us, as global leaders, to look to our world with a renewed sense of hope and sincere optimism.@@@It is with that renewed sense of hope that we must continue to press forward and aim not only to achieve the 17 SDGS adopted by this multilateral forum but to dramatically affect for the greater good the lives of the people whom we have been entrusted to lead.@@@I do not take that position for granted.@@@Along with my Government.@@@I envision the possibility that the pursuit of those Goals in accordance with the 2030 Agenda can and will be met.@@@With steadfast commitment, a shared vision and cooperation from all of us, we can indeed achieve peace, prosperity, progress and sustainability for all our citizens and all peace-loving nations represented and assembled in this Hall.@@@First of all, let me congratulate Mr. Dennis Francis on assuming the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session.@@@I will not be the first and definitely not the last speaker in this body who will identify global threats to democracies, challenges to security and violations of the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations, including the non-use of force and the peaceful resolution of conflicts, as a main source of instability and tension in the world.@@@The devastating developments of the past years, which have disrupted the security architecture throughout the world, especially in Europe, have significantly damaged multilateralism.@@@If a few years ago we were contemplating the decline of multilateralism, today we are seeing an erosion of that very tenet and its foundations, including international law, human rights and cooperative security.@@@That is not just a theoretical inference but a reality with which the Armenian people in the South Caucasus have been coping for the last three years.@@@The repeated aggression by Azerbaijan against the sovereign territory of the Republic of Armenia and the military attacks against the people of Nagorno-Karabakh significantly disrupt peace and stability in our region and massively violate human rights and humanitarian law, representing an existential threat for Armenians.@@@My Government, which has a sincere belief in and aspiration to the establishment of peace and stability in our region, has made significant and duly recorded efforts to that end.@@@Alas, we do not have a partner for peace, but a country that openly declares that might is right and constantly uses force to disrupt the peace process.@@@Exactly one year ago, from this very rostrum, the Prime Minister of Armenia presented the fact of the aggression against and the occupation of the Republic of Armenia’s sovereign territories by neighbouring Azerbaijan (see A/77/PV.9).@@@Since then, the situation has deteriorated even further, and today I must present yet another very recent act involving a large-scale offensive, this time against the indigenous people of Nagorno-Karabakh, in blatant violation of international law and the trilateral statement of 9 November 2020.@@@It happened this week, and the timing was not accidental.@@@That shows Azerbaijan’s open disregard for and defiance of the international community that has gathered here in New York.@@@The message is clear: Member States can talk about peace, and we can go to war, and they will not be able to change anything.@@@Indeed.@@@120.000 people, whose sole aspiration is to live and create in peace and dignity in their ancestral homeland and who have already been suffering under the nine-month blockade and siege by Azerbaijan, were subjected to a military attack by tens of thousands of troops.@@@In the course of that inhumane attack, the whole territory of Nagorno-Karabakh.@@@Stepanakert and other towns and settlements was subjected to intense and indiscriminate shelling with heavy weaponry, including rockets, artillery, combat unmanned aerial vehicles and aviation, as well as prohibited cluster munitions.@@@That atrocious large-scale offensive, which claimed hundreds of lives, including those of women and children, was cynically defined as a local counterterrorist operation.@@@According to recent information, there are confirmed reports of more than 200 people killed and 400 wounded, including, among the civilian population, women and children, a figure that is also accepted by the Azerbaijani Ministry of Foreign Affairs.@@@The fate of hundreds of others is uncertain.@@@Even as I speak today.@@@30 per cent of the population of Nagorno-Karabakh is displaced.@@@The entire population remains without any means of subsistence, as only limited humanitarian assistance has been able to enter into Nagorno-Karabakh.@@@There is no food, no medicine, no shelter, no place to go; they are separated from their families, terrorized and afraid for their lives.@@@The policy and actions of Azerbaijan for the past nine months clearly demonstrate the preplanned and well-orchestrated nature of that mass atrocity.@@@On 12 December 2022.@@@Azerbaijan blockaded the Lachin Corridor — the only road and the lifeline connecting Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia and the outside world, in blatant violation of its obligations under international humanitarian law and the trilateral statement of 9 November 2020.@@@The blockade was further consolidated by the installation of an illegal checkpoint on 23 April, as well as by the complete cessation of any movement, even of humanitarian aid, through the Corridor since 15 June.@@@The nine-month-long blockade of Nagorno-Karabakh has caused a severe shortage of food, medical supplies, fuel and other essential goods, almost depleting the resources necessary for the survival of the population.@@@The blockade was accompanied by the deliberate disruption of electricity and natural-gas supplies, further exacerbating the situation and transforming it into a full-fledged humanitarian crisis.@@@I would like to emphasize that on 22 February the International Court of Justice indicated a provisional measure according to which:
“Azerbaijan .., shall take all measures .., to ensure unimpeded movement of persons, vehicles and cargo along the Lachin Corridor in both directions.”@@@That order was later reconfirmed by the Court’s order of 6 July.@@@A number of partner States; international organizations, including United Nations Special Rapporteurs; the International Committee of the Red Cross; Human Rights Watch; Freedom House; Amnesty International; and Transparency International have been continuously raising the alarm about the deteriorating situation on the ground.@@@Moreover, on 16 August, during the emergency meeting of the Security Council convened at the request of Armenia (see S/PV.9397), the majority of Council member States stated clear positions regarding the need to unblock the Lachin Corridor, halt the suffering of the people of Nagorno-Karabakh and ensure their fundamental human rights — whereas in response to those clear-cut calls.@@@Azerbaijan intensified its inhumane actions by launching a military attack against the people of Nagorno-Karabakh.@@@On 21 September, two days ago, the Security Council gathered once again to discuss the devastating situation in Nagorno-Karabakh (see S/PV.9422).@@@The majority of Council members expressed their position regarding the imperative cessation of hostilities by Azerbaijan, the opening of the Lachin Corridor, the ensuring of international humanitarian access and the need to address the issue of the rights and security of the people of Nagorno-Karabakh.@@@The chronology of the truly devastating developments in our region proves that the issues there cannot be addressed merely through statements and generic calls.@@@Armenia has repeatedly warned the international community about the need for concrete and practical action, including the dispatching of a United Nations inter-agency needs-assessment and fact-finding mission to Nagorno-Karabakh.@@@But the international community, the United Nations, has failed to come to the rescue of the people for the past nine months — 285 days.@@@The use of starvation as a method of warfare, depriving people of their means of subsistence, the obstruction and denial of humanitarian access by United Nations agencies and the hindering of the humanitarian activities of the International Committee of the Red Cross constitute early warning signs of an atrocity crime.@@@A number of international human rights organizations, lawyers, genocide scholars and reputable independent experts, including the former Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court and the former Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on the Prevention of Genocide, have already characterized the situation on the ground in Nagorno-Karabakh as posing the risk of genocide.@@@Just yesterday the Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on the Prevention of Genocide.@@@Alice Wairimu Nderitu, stressed:
“Military action can only contribute to escalating what is already a tense situation and to put the civilian population in the area at risk of violence, including the risk of genocide and related atrocity crimes.@@@All efforts need to be made to prevent violence and sustain peace.”
Let me draw the Assembly’s attention to the fact that after the failure to prevent genocide in Rwanda, the United Nations managed to create mechanisms for prevention, thus making “never again” a meaningful pledge.@@@But today we are on the brink of another failure.@@@The people of Nagorno-Karabakh, trapped in the inhumane blockade and hostilities inflicted by Azerbaijan and living with a threat to their very existence, continue to hope that prevention will not remain just a word but will become a line of action.@@@The claims that the United Nations is not present on the ground and therefore has no capacity to verify the situation cannot be an excuse for inaction.@@@The United Nations is a universal body that should stand with the victims of mass atrocity crimes all over the world regardless of the status of a territory instead of making dismissive statements.@@@We are hopeful that the international community, namely, the United Nations, will demonstrate strong political will and condemn the resumption of hostilities and the targeting of civilian settlements and infrastructure, and demand full compliance with obligations under international humanitarian law, including those related to the protection of civilians, in particular women and children, and critical civilian infrastructure.@@@The international community should undertake every effort for the immediate deployment of an inter-agency mission by the United Nations to Nagorno-Karabakh with the aim of monitoring and assessing the human rights, humanitarian and security situation on the ground.@@@The unimpeded access of United Nations agencies and other international organizations to Nagorno-Karabakh, in line with humanitarian principles, are an imperative.@@@In that regard, we also stress the need to ensure the full cooperation of the parties in good faith with the International Committee of the Red Cross to address the consequences of the military attack, including the removal and identification of bodies, the search for and rescue of missing personnel and civilians, the release of prisoners of war and the safe and unimpeded delivery of humanitarian assistance, in strict compliance with international humanitarian law.@@@Azerbaijan must finally adhere to its legally binding obligations and ensure the freedom of movement of persons, vehicles and cargo, along the Lachin Corridor, in line with the International Court of Justice orders.@@@We firmly believe that relevant mechanisms must be introduced to ensure the return of persons displaced in the course of the recent military attack, as well as persons and refugees displaced as a result of the 2020 war, to their homes on the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh and adjacent regions under the monitoring and control of the relevant United Nations agencies, as foreseen in the trilateral statement of 9 November 2020.@@@A sustainable and viable international mechanism for preventing the ethnic cleansing of the indigenous population of Nagorno-Karabakh and for ensuring dialogue between representatives of Nagorno-Karabakh and officials in Baku to address the issues related to the rights and security of the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh is an imperative.@@@Furthermore, excluding punitive actions against Nagorno-Karabakh political and military representatives and personnel should be guaranteed.@@@We also believe that the international community must demand the exit of any Azerbaijani military and law-enforcement bodies from all civilian settlements in Nagorno-Karabakh to prevent panic, provocations and any escalation as well as the endangering of the civilian population and to create the possibility for a United Nations-mandated peacekeeping force to maintain stability and security in Nagorno-Karabakh.@@@The ethnic cleansing policy against Nagorno-Karabakh is just part of the bigger picture.@@@In that regard, we clearly see an intention to involve the Republic of Armenia in military actions, thus widening the geography of hostilities into our sovereign territories.@@@The unwillingness of Azerbaijan to genuinely and constructively engage in a peace process with Armenia, including a recognition of the territorial integrity of the Republic of Armenia, the withdrawal of its armed forces from the occupied territories of Armenia, delimitate the Armenian-Azerbaijani interstate borders based on the latest available maps from 1975 corresponding with the Almaty 1991 declaration, create a demilitarized zone along the interstate border, clearly illustrates the intentions I have mentioned.@@@Likewise.@@@Azerbaijan has a hidden agenda when it comes to unblocking regional transport and economic communications.@@@As a landlocked country.@@@Armenia is vitally interested in the implementation of the agreement on the unblocking of all regional communications on the basis of sovereignty, national jurisdiction, equality and reciprocity.@@@Armenia is a long-standing advocate of inclusive and equitable transport connectivity with a view to promoting trade, cooperation and people-to-people contacts, whereas our neighbour continues to impose the three-decade-long blockade of Armenia as part of its well-established policy of economic coercion of my country.@@@The so-called “corridor” logic promoted by Baku and its hidden and open sponsors is aimed at undermining the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Armenia and justifying its territorial claims.@@@The narrative it has generated along with the use of force by Azerbaijan against both the Republic of Armenia and the people of Nagorno-Karabakh show that forcefully imposing on Armenia an extraterritorial corridor, a corridor that would pass through the territory of Armenia but would be out of our control, could be the next goal.@@@That is unacceptable to us and should be unacceptable to the international community.@@@Despite all the challenges.@@@Armenia continues to engage in negotiations to achieve the normalization of relations and the establishment of a lasting peace in the region and supports the efforts of international partners to that end.@@@Respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty within the internationally recognized borders and addressing the underlying causes of the conflict, namely, the rights and security of the 
people of Nagorno-Karabakh, are the foundation of a lasting peace.@@@In conclusion, let me state that the people of Armenia will firmly stand for our sovereignty, independence and democracy and will overcome the hybrid war unleashed against us.@@@The era we are traversing has been marked by a series of crises and proliferating major conflicts in a world full of tensions.@@@While the challenges we face are formidable, it is our mindset and our attitude in facing them that are now extremely important and decisive.@@@Are we ready to do everything we can to try to improve the situation?@@@In any case, it is clear that we must.@@@Together, we must combat these crises — the climate crisis, wars, social conflict and growing inequalities, as well as the weakening of democratic institutions and the erosion of the multilateral structures that enable us to connect at the international level.@@@It would seem that that everywhere — or almost everywhere — protectionism, a kind of withdrawal and selfishness are on the rise, even though we are all aware that withdrawal, threats and violence have never solved global issues and inequalities.@@@It is true.@@@We all see it.@@@We are experiencing a global crisis, probably the biggest since the end of the Second World War.@@@In launching an aggressive war against Ukraine, the Russian Federation has not only attacked a peaceful country, but it has also attacked international law and our multilateral structures.@@@What is strange is that this aggression is the work of a permanent member of the Security Council, which, according to the Charter of the United Nations, has the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security.@@@Today we should recall the essential principles enshrined in the Charter and ensure that we fulfil the mandate entrusted to us in that regard.@@@What we also know in these situations is that it is the poorest and most fragile States and regions that would suffer the most if our confidence in the international system were to weaken.@@@I have already mentioned the Charter of the United Nations, which is a cornerstone of public international law, and this year is the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which represents a unique opportunity to reaffirm the global consensus embodied in the Declaration and a key moment for uniting and strengthening the international community.@@@The United Nations is the foundation of peaceful collaboration and mutual trust between States.@@@I believe there is no way that these challenges can be overcome by isolated initiatives.@@@Our actions must be collaborative and collective.@@@Take the fight against inequality, for instance.@@@Strong multilateral institutions are essential to combating inequalities, which unfortunately always worsen during crises.@@@Climate change exacerbates social and economic inequalities, too.@@@And we are seeing inequalities increase exponentially — whether they are social and gender inequalities or economic disparities — not only between countries but within them.@@@I was struck when I read again recently that over the past 20 years the income gap between the richest 10 per cent and the poorest 50 per cent has doubled.@@@I was also struck to read again recently that inequalities are as large today as they were at the beginning of the twentieth century, before the First World War.@@@Those inequalities have continued to have a disproportionate effect on those who are already the most vulnerable in our societies, thereby encouraging instability and populism and a loss of confidence in democracy and institutions.@@@That fragility therefore threatens all of us, nationally and internationally.@@@For what is probably too long, we have believed that defending our interests and protecting the most vulnerable were two different things.@@@Today we know that the one cannot exist without the other.@@@And strong multilateral institutions are also essential to promoting peace.@@@But we do have a few things that we can build on together.@@@For instance, the Secretary-General’s New Agenda for Peace stresses the very important point that prevention is the starting point of any peace effort.@@@Inequality of access and of opportunity in terms of food, health, employment and property leads to conflicts.@@@We must all make every effort to ensure that everyone, in all of our countries, is able to participate fully in political, economic, social and cultural life.@@@In that regard, internationally speaking, we must engage resolutely in combating threats, persecution and acts of violence, especially those against women — and especially people who are working to defend human rights.@@@Young people must also have real prospects for development and prosperity.@@@I have spoken of inequality.@@@I have spoken of the promotion of peace.@@@There is also of course the key role played by multilateral institutions in the protection of civilians.@@@All armed conflicts are different.@@@But what they all have in common is that they increase inequality and the suffering of civilians.@@@In that regard, strong multilateral institutions are essential.@@@Also essential is respect for international humanitarian law, which is an 
absolute priority for Switzerland and at the heart of our efforts in the Security Council.@@@And I want to take this opportunity to reiterate that the protection of civilians in armed conflict is not an option but an obligation for all the parties to a conflict.@@@Over the past year I have had several opportunities to visit countries that have been marked by conflict, notably Mozambique, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Colombia.@@@Those contacts with conflict- affected populations have served as a reminder of how essential it is to address the root causes of conflicts if we are to ensure lasting peace.@@@I was also able to observe first-hand how important the full participation of women is to any return to peace.@@@For that reason.@@@Switzerland remains committed to implementing the agenda on women and peace and security and will continue to actively work for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions.@@@During armed conflicts, the lack of essential goods and services for the civilian population often claims more lives than the direct impact of the hostilities.@@@It exacerbates inequalities and undermines the return to peace.@@@In that context.@@@I would like to take this opportunity to stress the importance of the United Nations peacekeeping missions, which are doing indispensable work for the populations that are most affected.@@@In that regard.@@@I also believe that all humanitarian actors, including those in United Nations missions on the ground and other actors, must be protected and supported.@@@In that context, the work of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) must also be strongly defended.@@@Owing to the growing number of crises, our Organization is dealing with an unprecedented and worrisome increase in needs.@@@As the depositary of the Geneva Conventions and the headquarters of the ICRC.@@@Switzerland is firmly committed to meeting that humanitarian imperative.@@@The work of the ICRC is fundamental to the protection of civilians.@@@Today I have mentioned some of the factors in the clearly immense challenges we are facing.@@@We must be clear about where our collective interests lie — and that is certainly not in the disorder that the world is witnessing and that some are hoping to intensify for their own benefit.@@@On the contrary, our collective interests lie in a renewed world order that can guarantee stability, trust and prospects for all.@@@And it is precisely for that reason that we must take a stand and commit to keeping international cooperation alive.@@@The United Nations did not come out of nowhere.@@@It embodies the institutionalized hope for a better world.@@@It is an arguably idealistic project, born of another age of war, brutality and despair, and it rests on the belief that international cooperation is vital, that the world can be a better place only if each and every one of us shoulders our responsibilities and that ultimately what unites nations and peoples is much stronger than what divides them.@@@Perhaps that observation can give us cause for optimism during this time marked by significant pessimism, and can encourage us to both strengthen and deepen our work together on a global scale.@@@The seventy-eighth session of the General Assembly offers us a unique chance and a rare opportunity to come together in a show of trust and to prepare together for the Summit of the Future in 2024 in order to strengthen cooperation on essential issues, fill the gaps in global governance and reaffirm existing commitments.@@@That applies in particular to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@Yesterday’s debates and discussions at the Sustainable Development Goals Summit were very impressive and interesting to participate in.@@@The outcomes of the Summit should enable us to breathe new life into the 2030 Agenda, which is none other than our collective road map to a better future.@@@Let us therefore demonstrate responsibility and solidarity with a view to building a fairer and more egalitarian world — not so much for us today but for those who will succeed us, our future generations.@@@It really must be made clear that we need to shoulder that responsibility ourselves and that we cannot delegate it.@@@It is our responsibility.@@@Many of the speakers who have preceded me have expressed the thought that our shared planet is undergoing irreversible change.@@@A new world order is being born before our eyes.@@@Our future is being shaped through a struggle between the majority of the world’s peoples, who advocate for a fairer distribution of global goods and civilizational diversity, and the few who use neocolonial methods of subjugation in order to hold on to their disappearing dominance.@@@The calling card, so to speak, of the collective West has long been a refusal to accept the principle of equality and a total unwillingness to negotiate.@@@Accustomed to looking down on the rest of the world.@@@Americans and Europeans constantly make all kinds of promises and undertake obligations — including written and legally binding ones — and then simply do not fulfil them.@@@As President Putin has pointed out, the West has truly shown itself to be an empire of lies.@@@Like many other countries.@@@Russia knows that from first-hand experience.@@@In 1945, when together with Washington and London we were defeating the enemy on the front lines of the Second World War, our allies in the anti-Hitler coalition were already planning a military operation — Operation Unthinkable — against the Soviet Union.@@@Four years later, in 1949, the Americans developed Operation Dropshot, designed to launch massive nuclear strikes on the Soviet Union.@@@Those insane plans remained on paper, and the Soviet Union created its own retaliatory weapon.@@@It took the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, when the world teetered on the brink of a nuclear war, for the idea of unleashing such weapons and the illusion that they could bring victory to cease to be a basis for the United States’ military planning.@@@When the Cold War ended, the Soviet Union played a decisive role in the unification of Germany and the agreement on the parameters of a new security architecture in Europe.@@@Furthermore, the Soviet leadership, and Russia’s leaders after them, were given specific political assurances regarding the non-expansion eastward of the NATO military bloc.@@@The corresponding records of those negotiations are in both our archives and those of the West, and are publicly available.@@@But those Western leaders’ assurances turned out to be fraudulent.@@@They had no intention of fulfilling them.@@@Meanwhile, they were not in the least embarrassed by the fact that by bringing NATO closer to Russia’s borders, they were flagrantly violating the official commitments, made at the highest level in accordance with Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe policy, to refraining from strengthening their own security at others’ expense or allowing any country, group of countries or organization to achieve military and political dominance in Europe.@@@In 2021 our proposals for concluding agreements on mutual security guarantees in Europe without changing Ukraine’s non-aligned status were arrogantly rejected.@@@The West continued to systematically militarize the Russophobic Kyiv regime, which came to power through a bloody coup and was used to prepare for the unleashing of a hybrid war on our country.@@@The recent series of joint exercises between the United States and its European NATO allies, including testing scenarios for the use of nuclear weapons on the territory of the Russian Federation, is a precedent unseen since the end of the Cold War.@@@The obsessive insistence on fulfilling stated aim of inflicting “strategic defeat” on Russia decidedly blinded those irresponsible politicians who while they believe in their own impunity have lost the most basic sense of self-preservation.@@@Led by Washington, the NATO countries are not only building up and modernizing their offensive capabilities, but they are also trying to shift the armed confrontation into the outer space and information arenas.@@@One new and dangerous manifestation of NATO’s expansionism is the attempt to extend the bloc’s area of responsibility to the entire Eastern hemisphere under devious slogans touting the “indivisible security of the Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific regions”.@@@To that end.@@@Washington is creating subordinate, mini military and political alliances such as the Australia- United Kingdom-United States troika AUKUS, the United States-Japan-Republic of Korea trio and the Tokyo-Seoul-Canberra-Wellington quartet, pushing the participants into practical cooperation with NATO, which introduces its infrastructure into the Pacific theatre.@@@Those efforts, which are openly designed to target Russia and China and bring about the collapse of the inclusive regional architecture that has arisen around the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, create a risk of the emergence of a new, explosive hotbed of geopolitical tension in addition to that in Europe, which has already reached boiling point.@@@We get the distinct impression that the United States and the “Western collective” that is completely subordinate to it have decided to give the Monroe Doctrine a global dimension.@@@Those plans are both illusory and extremely dangerous, but that has not stopped the ideologists behind the new edition of the Pax Americana.@@@The global minority is doing its utmost to slow the natural course of events.@@@The Vilnius Summit communique issued by NATO Heads of State and Government characterizes what it calls “the deepening strategic partnership” between China and Russia as a threat to NATO.@@@Speaking recently to his ambassadors abroad.@@@President Macron of France expressed genuine concern about the potential expansion of the group made up of Brazil.@@@Russia.@@@India.@@@China and South Africa (BRICS), claiming that it was evidence that
“The increasingly complex situation in the international arena poses the risk that the West, and Europe in particular, will become weaker ...@@@The world order, with its principles and various forms of organization, where the West occupied and continues to occupy dominant positions, is being revised.”@@@Thus, if anyone, anywhere, gets together or makes friends without us or our permission, that is seen as a threat to our dominance.@@@NATO’s advance into the Asia-Pacific region is “beneficial”, while the expansion of BRICS is dangerous.@@@And yet history’s logic is inexorable.@@@The essential trend we are seeing is the desire of a majority of the world’s countries to strengthen their sovereignty and defend their national interests, traditions, culture and way of life.@@@They no longer want to live according to anyone else’s dictates.@@@They want to be friends and trade among themselves, but with the rest of the world as well — just on an equal footing and to the mutual benefit of all.@@@Alliances such as BRICS and the Shanghai 
Cooperation Organization are on the rise, giving the countries of the global South opportunities for joint development and standing up for the place they deserve in what is clearly an emerging multipolar architecture.@@@It may be that for the first time since 1945, when the United Nations was founded, we are seeing a chance for genuine democratization in world affairs, which is reason for optimism for all who believe in the supremacy of international law and want to see the revitalization of the United Nations as the central coordinating body of world politics, where we can agree on how to solve problems together, based on an honest balancing of interests.@@@As far as Russia is concerned, there is clearly no alternative to that.@@@However, the United States and its subordinates in the collective West continue to multiply conflicts that divide humankind artificially into hostile blocs and prevent us from achieving our shared goals.@@@They are doing everything they can to prevent the establishment of a truly multipolar and just world order.@@@They are trying to make the world play by their infamous and narrowly self-serving rules.@@@I would like to urge Western politicians and diplomats to carefully reread the Charter of the United Nations one more time.@@@The cornerstone of the world order, created in the wake of the Second World War, is the democratic principle of the sovereign equality of States, large and small, regardless of their form of Government or internal political or socioeconomic structure.@@@But the West still considers itself superior to the rest of humankind, as illustrated by an already notorious statement by the chief diplomat of the European Union (EU).@@@Josep Borrell Fontelles, when he said that “Europe is a [blossoming] garden...@@@[and] most of the rest of the world is a jungle”.@@@He is not bothered by the fact that Islamophobia and other forms of intolerance of the traditional values of every world religion run rampant in that garden.@@@Acts such as burning the Qur’an, insulting the Torah, persecuting Orthodox clergy and other kinds of mockery of the feelings of believers are literally happening all over Europe.@@@The West’s use of unilateral coercive measures is also a flagrant violation of the principle of the sovereign equality of States.@@@The countries that have fallen victim to illegal sanctions — and there are more and more of them — are well aware that those restrictions hit the most vulnerable segments of the population hardest, provoking crises in the food and energy markets.@@@We continue to insist on an immediate and total end to the United States’ unprecedentedly inhumane trade, economic and financial blockade of Cuba and on rescinding the absurd decision to declare Cuba a State sponsor of terrorism.@@@Washington must abandon its policy of economic strangulation of Venezuela, without preconditions of any kind.@@@We demand the lifting of the unilateral sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union on the Syrian Arab Republic, which are egregiously undermining its right to development.@@@Any coercive measures imposed in circumvention of the Security Council must end, along with the West’s practice of manipulating the Council’s sanctions policies to put pressure on anyone it does not like.@@@A blatant manifestation of the Western minority’s self-centredness has been its obsessive attempts to Ukraineize the agenda for all international discussions, while relegating to the background a whole series of unresolved regional crises, many of which have been dragging on for years or even decades.@@@It will be impossible to fully normalize the situation in the Middle East without resolving the main issue, which is settling the protracted Palestinian-Israeli conflict, based on the relevant United Nations resolutions and the Arab Peace Initiative, originally introduced by Saudi Arabia.@@@The Palestinians have been waiting for the State that was solemnly promised to them for more than 70 years, but the Americans, who have monopolized the mediation process, have done everything they can to prevent it.@@@We call on all responsible countries to unite their efforts to create the conditions for a resumption of direct Palestinian-Israeli negotiations.@@@It is encouraging that the League of Arab States has got a second wind and is revitalizing its role in regional affairs.@@@We welcome Syria’s return to the Arab family and the normalization process that has begun between Damascus and Ankara, which we are trying to assist in together with our Iranian colleagues.@@@Those positive developments reinforce the efforts of the Astana format to move closer to a settlement of the Syria issue, based on resolution 2254 (2015) and the restoration of Syria’s sovereignty.@@@We hope that with the assistance of the United Nations.@@@Libyans will be able to meaningfully prepare for holding general elections in their long-suffering country.@@@It has been unable to recover from the consequences of the NATO aggression of more than a decade ago, which destroyed the Libyan State and opened the floodgates for the spread of terrorism in the Sahel-Saharan region and for waves of millions of illegal migrants to Europe and other parts of the world.@@@Analysts have noted that Muammar Al-Qaddafi was annihilated as soon as he abandoned his military nuclear 
programme.@@@The West thereby created horrifying risks for the entire nuclear non-proliferation regime.@@@We are concerned about the military hysteria that Washington and its Asian allies have been whipping up on the Korean peninsula, where United States strategic capabilities are being ramped up.@@@The Russian and Chinese initiatives aimed at focusing on humanitarian and political issues as priorities have been rejected.@@@The tragic evolution of the situation in the Sudan is simply yet another consequence of the West’s failed experiments in exporting liberal democratic dogmas.@@@We support constructive initiatives aimed at a rapid settlement of the intra-Sudanese conflict, first and foremost by facilitating a direct dialogue between the warring parties.@@@As we have observed the West’s nervous reaction to recent events in Africa, particularly in the Niger and Gabon, we cannot help recalling how Washington and Brussels responded to the bloody coup in Ukraine in February 2014, which I already mentioned.@@@It happened a day after a settlement agreement had been reached under EU guarantees, which the opposition simply trampled upon.@@@The United States and its allies supported the coup, welcoming it as a “manifestation of democracy”.@@@The continuing deterioration of the situation in the Serbian province of Kosovo is a serious cause for concern.@@@In supplying weapons to the Kosovars and helping them build an army.@@@NATO is flagrantly violating the Security Council’s keystone resolution 1244 (1999).@@@The whole world can see the sad story of the Minsk agreements on Ukraine repeating itself in the Balkans.@@@I would like to remind members that the agreements provided for the special status of the Donbas republics and Kyiv sabotaged them openly with the West’s support.@@@And now the European Union does not want to make its Kosovo proteges implement the 2013 agreements between Belgrade and Pristina on establishing a community of Serbian municipalities in Kosovo, with special rights regarding their language and traditions.@@@In both cases, the EU was the guarantor of the agreements, and apparently they have shared the same fate.@@@Like so-called sponsor, like result.@@@Together with Washington.@@@Brussels is now imposing its so- called mediation services on Azerbaijan and Armenia and helping to destabilize the South Caucasus.@@@Now that Yerevan and Baku’s leaders have settled the issue of mutually acknowledging the two countries’ sovereignty between themselves, it is time for peace, making life more comfortable and building trust.@@@Russia’s peacekeeping contingent will spare no effort to enable that.@@@Speaking of decisions of the international community that have remained on paper, we call for the completion, at long last, of the decolonization process in accordance with the relevant General Assembly resolutions and an end to colonial and neocolonial practices.@@@A vivid illustration of the “rules” that the West wants to make the whole world live by is the fate of the commitments it made back in 2009 to providing developing countries with $100 billion annually to finance climate-change adaptation programmes.@@@If one compares the fate of those unfulfilled promises with the amounts that the United States.@@@NATO and the EU have spent to support the racist regime in Kyiv, which is estimated at as much as $170 billion over the past year and a half, one can gain an understanding of what the “enlightened Western democracies”, with their so- called values, really think of you.@@@Overall, it is high time that we reformed the existing architecture of global governance, which has long failed to meet the needs of our times.@@@The United States and its allies should abandon their artificial restrictions on the redistribution of voting quotas in the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, while acknowledging the true economic and financial clout of the countries of the global South.@@@The work of the Dispute Settlement Body of the World Trade Organization should also be immediately unblocked.@@@The expansion of the composition of the Security Council is also becoming increasingly important.@@@That should be done solely by remedying the underrepresentation of the world’s majority countries — in Asia.@@@Africa and Latin America.@@@It is important that the new members of the Security Council, both permanent and non-permanent, can enjoy authority in their own regions and in global organizations such as the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, the Group of 77 and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation.@@@It is high time to consider fairer methods of composition of the Secretariat.@@@The criteria in place for many years do not reflect the real weight of States in global affairs and artificially ensure excessive dominance of citizens of countries from NATO and the EU.@@@Those imbalances are further exacerbated by the system of permanent contracts, which links people to positions in host countries of international organization 
headquarters, the overwhelming majority of which are located in capitals that promote Western policies.@@@The United Nations reform should be supported by a new type of association, where there are no leaders and followers or teachers and students and where all issues are resolved on the basis of a consensus and the balance of interests.@@@For example that is truly reflected in BRICS, which has significantly increased its authority following the Johannesburg summit and gained truly global influence.@@@At the regional level, there has been a clear renaissance of organizations such as the African Union, the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, the League of Arab States, the Gulf Cooperation Council and others.@@@In Eurasia, a harmonization of integration processes gaining momentum within the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the Collective Security Treaty Organization, the Eurasian Economic community, the Commonwealth of Independent States and the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative.@@@A Greater Eurasian Partnership is also being naturally formed and is open for participation to all associations and countries of our shared continent, without exception.@@@Unfortunately, those positive trends are being undermined by the increasingly aggressive Western attempts to maintain their dominance in world politics, economy and finance.@@@It is in the common interest to avoid a fragmentation of the world into isolated trading blocs and macroregions, but if the United States and its allies do not want to negotiate on making globalization processes fair and equitable, then the rest of us will have to draw their own conclusions and think about how to make the prospects for their socioeconomic and technological development not dependent on the neocolonial instincts of their former colonial Powers.@@@The main problem lies with the West, because developing countries are prepared to negotiate, including on the platform of the Group of 20 (G20), as we saw at the recent Group summit in India.@@@The main conclusion we reached after that summit is that the G20 can and should avoid politicization and should be able to do what it was created for: develop mutually acceptable ways to manage the global economy and finances.@@@The opportunities for dialogue and negotiations are there, and we must not miss this moment.@@@All these trends must be fully taken into account in the work of the Secretariat, whose statutory aim is to seek the consent of all Member States within the United Nations, not somewhere else.@@@The United Nations was founded based on the outcome of the Second World War, and any attempt to revise that outcome would undermine the foundations of the world Organization.@@@As a representative of a country that made a decisive contribution to the defeat of fascism and Japanese militarism.@@@I would like to draw attention to the egregious phenomenon of rehabilitating Nazis and collaborators in a number of European countries, primarily Ukraine and the Baltic States.@@@It is particularly alarming that last year, for the first time.@@@Germany.@@@Italy and Japan voted against the General Assembly resolution to combat the glorification of Nazism (see A/77/PV.54).@@@That regrettable fact casts doubt on the sincerity of the repentance of those States for the mass crimes against humanity they perpetrated during the Second World War and runs counter to the conditions under which they were admitted to the United Nations as full-fledged members.@@@We strongly urge the Assembly to pay special attention to these metamorphoses, which fly in the face of the position of the global majority and the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.@@@Today, as so many times before, humankind is again at a crossroads.@@@How history will play out is entirely up to us.@@@It is in our shared interest to prevent a downward spiral into large-scale war and the final collapse of the mechanisms of international cooperation that were put in place by generations of our predecessors.@@@The Secretary-General put forward an initiative to hold the Summit of the Future next year.@@@The success of that undertaking can be ensured only through striking a fair and just balance of interests of all Member States, while respecting the intergovernmental character of our Organization.@@@At our meeting on 21 September, the members of the Group of Friends in Defence of the Charter of the United Nations agreed to actively contribute to achieving that.@@@As the Secretary-General said at a press conference on the eve of this session:
“If we want a future of peace and prosperity based on equity and solidarity, leaders have a special responsibility to achieve compromise in designing our common future for our common good.”@@@That is an excellent response to those who are trying to divide the world into democracies and autocracies and dictate their neocolonial rules to others.@@@I am proud to observe that this organ is under the dedicated leadership of our Caribbean sister nation Trinidad and Tobago and that a distinguished citizen and experienced diplomat of that country is at the helm of the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session.@@@This is my fourth statement to this global organ, and I am afraid to conclude that not much has changed for the better in that time with regard to the essential elements of peace, prosperity and climate in our world.@@@On the other hand, the challenges and crises have increased and deepened.@@@I do not need to mention those crises, because we know them all and refer to them every single time we speak to an international or regional audience.@@@The more important and relevant matter at hand is to decide what to do about them.@@@We make promises that are often not kept.@@@We express noble goals, but their delivery is poor.@@@That cannot go on.@@@Business as usual cannot be our mantra.@@@No country is spared the effects of those crises, especially developing countries, such as my own country.@@@Suriname.@@@And no country can solve those challenges alone.@@@It is worth mentioning that we humans are responsible for those crises, and we must take responsibility for them.@@@We must also exercise collective leadership to solve those problems effectively.@@@A new approach to conceptualizing our relationships is needed to adequately address those crises.@@@We need a new kind of multilateralism that is more just and effective and that compels us to unite — one that will demonstrate respect for, and commitment to, international law and cooperation.@@@It is therefore of the utmost importance to transcend national interests and look to our common goals.@@@We must put aside ideological differences in order to constructively deliver for the prosperity of our people and the protection of our planet.@@@We simply cannot expect durable solutions in a rapidly changing world if we do not reset the buttons.@@@As world leaders, we have stressed that upholding firm commitments to international principles and international law, the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and effective multilateralism are a sine qua non condition for addressing those global challenges and threats.@@@The United Nations role in defending and upholding those principles through dialogue, constructive engagement and concrete action remains crucial.@@@A strong, determined and united United Nations is therefore a must.@@@The multiple global and national crises, such as the debt burden, the domestic effects of climate change, the financial-economic downturn following the coronavirus disease pandemic and the impact of the war raging in Ukraine, have put tremendous pressure on the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals on a major scale.@@@Limited financial and technical resources had to be allocated for many emergencies just to make sure that no one was left behind.@@@Let us remember that building resilience and leaving no one behind is not a choice.@@@I want to reiterate that, for small developing countries with low-lying coastal areas, the fiscal pressure due to other crises beyond our doing 
is a real and daily problem.@@@However.@@@I remain of the view that the earmarked transformation envisioned in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development remains both possible and essential.@@@As we know, food security is a major challenge.@@@Just a few days ago in Cuba.@@@I stressed the importance of science, technology and innovation for increasing food production and optimizing the inputs needed to make agriculture more productive.@@@During my visit.@@@I personally experienced the negative impact of the longstanding embargo — one that does not achieve what it was meant for.@@@The Caribbean Community’s food security programme is an example of efforts to reduce the region’s food import bill by 25 per cent by 2025 and promote local production with modern technology.@@@The reach and impact of digital technologies will only continue to increase in the coming years, and it is crucial for the benefits of those innovations to be leveraged to ensure an accessible, transparent, safe and secure digitally transformative environment.@@@To implement that comprehensive strategy in a coherent manner, my country recently designed and adopted a national digital strategy for the period 2023-2030.@@@The political, humanitarian and security environment in Haiti is deteriorating.@@@While I appreciate the efforts made to date to assist in finding an immediate solution, many more political efforts need to be made to translate those intentions into real actions.@@@The people of Haiti are looking to the regional and international community for assistance.@@@At the same time, the Haitian stakeholders, who are divided into opposing groups, must demonstrate the will to engage in dialogue and reach a consensus for a way forward in the shortest time possible.@@@Another climate conference, the twenty-eighth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, is on our doorstep as we experience the reality of the increased intensity of the devastating global impact of climate change.@@@It is regrettable to admit that, despite some efforts, the world is still far from reaching the required decrease in emissions to prevent irreversible damage to our global environment and society.@@@And we are bearing the brunt of that.@@@Suriname is currently experiencing extraordinarily high temperatures, resulting in challenges with regard to the availability of drinking water.@@@Our inland areas are increasingly flooded by heavy rainfall, and our coastal areas are threatened by sea level rise.@@@As a consequence, the people living in remote parts of our vast interior are deprived of work, education and basic utilities, and food security is under threat.@@@As one of the only three carbon-negative countries in the world.@@@Suriname remains committed and continues to play its part in protecting the planet through national actions but also by engaging in strategic international public and private partnerships that will help to ensure that we remain carbon-negative now and in the future.@@@We cannot go to Dubai in less than two months and hear the same analyses, stories, policies, speeches and promises with noble goals, only to have nothing happen after that.@@@Yes, it takes too long to make the required decisions that will have a meaningful impact and improve our living conditions.@@@We need easier access to climate financing to implement mitigation and adaptation policies.@@@We must walk the talk where loss and damage are concerned.@@@We must join the efforts that call for compensating highly forested countries for so- called removal credits, because so far those countries have been acting as carbon sinks for the whole world without any compensation.@@@Many of us have raised the issue of urgent and comprehensive reform of the international financial architecture as the most critical action needed to address the economic, financial and environmental challenges facing developing countries.@@@An integral part of that reform process must be the discussion of new ways to classify countries.@@@I ask all of us to contribute to the proposed multidimensional vulnerability index.@@@My country.@@@Suriname, is on the cusp of promising commercial development of newfound oil and gas resources.@@@Those developments and capital generation will enable us to provide our population with a social, health and education system that will facilitate increased production in other sectors, creating a sustainable future for our current and succeeding generations.@@@Over the past three years.@@@Suriname has undergone a financial and economic reform process in which my country’s citizens had to sacrifice in many ways.@@@Coupled with the coronavirus disease pandemic, the impact of climate change, the effects of the war in Eastern Europe and a high debt burden, the impact on our people has been even worse.@@@I want to assure the international community that my Government is committed to remaining a carbon-negative country with an enormous biodiversity pool and a low deforestation level.@@@During the Amazon Summit held last August in Belem do Para, in Brazil, we and seven other countries committed to better management of the Amazon region.@@@We even committed to stopping deforestation by the year 2030.@@@We are committed to the application of high international environmental standards so that the impact on the environment can be minimized.@@@We are doing that to finance our committed transition to an economy based primarily on renewable, non-carbon-based energy generation by 2060.@@@With a certain degree of pride.@@@I would like to announce that we recently registered our carbon credits for the first time on the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change registry.@@@That was done with our own, albeit limited, capabilities.@@@We shall see how the market responds to those new resources.@@@All of those commitments are being made to contribute to saving the planet and life on Earth.@@@I call on all heavy polluters to start that process as well and not to try to manage, tax or punish environmentally friendly production in developing countries, which are the least responsible for the climate crisis.@@@Real change must come from the more developed countries in particular.@@@In conclusion, together let us harness our collective strengths, knowledge and determination to create a world where resilience and inclusivity are not just aspirations but realities.@@@Only through joint efforts can we build a future where no one is left behind and where the Sustainable Development Goals become a shining beacon of hope and progress for all.@@@We owe that to our current and future generations.@@@I appeal to all of us to work constructively and collectively towards a new and better world order and to recommit to the original goals of the Charter of the United Nations, only now with more dedication, passion and love for one another.@@@In less than 30 years, we will come to the halfway point of this century, and in less than 80 years the twenty-first century will end.@@@By that time, none of us will be Presidents and none of us will be alive.@@@So when we stand at this rostrum and speak of the future, we speak of a future that does not belong to us.@@@When we speak of a future with sustainable development, we speak of a better world not for us, but for our grandchildren and their children.@@@And the decisions we make today, the actions we take each day, are what determine the kind of future we are creating for them.@@@It is therefore not good enough to say that we must rebuild trust in the world when we continue making decisions that undermine trust.@@@It is not good enough to say that we want to reignite global solidarity when we continue to pick and choose whom we show solidarity with.@@@It is not good enough to say that we want to move towards peace when our actions in other nations promote war and create the conditions for conflict.@@@It is not good enough to say we want prosperity for all when our rules for trade and our financial systems are a recipe for deepening the poverty of other nations.@@@Unless we do change our decisions, our positions and our actions, the future we speak of today and the sustainable development we dream of achieving by 2030 will remain a reality only on paper.@@@And when it comes to urgent action, we must focus our attention, our energies and our resources on the areas where we are falling behind.@@@We must prioritize those places in the world that are most at risk of not achieving sustainability in any of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).@@@In the case of Malawi, the most pressing priorities are plain to see.@@@As a nation, we took the SDGs and aligned our national aspirations to reflect them.@@@Therefore, even though we have our sights set on the Malawi 2063 Vision, we also created an implementation plan for the first 10 years that coincides with the Decade of Action on the SDGs in the context of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@Our focus has already started yielding fruit, because in the past few years we have stayed on track with our quest to end hunger in line with SDG 2, to safeguard the good health and well-being of our citizens in line with SDG 3, to improve quality of education in line with SDG 4, to leverage Malawi’s abundant water resources for better sanitation in line with SDG 6, and to promote life below water in line with SDG 14.@@@Now, while we celebrate the progress we have made on those goals, with seven years to go before the end of the Decade of Action on the SDGs we are not satisfied with seeing progress on only five out of seventeen goals.@@@In fact, not only do we need support with making gains in the areas where we are seeing little, but we even need urgent support in safeguarding the gains we have made in the areas where we are doing well.@@@In short, we need urgent support in building resilience to inoculate our economy against the adverse effects of shocks.@@@In the 12 months since the last time I stood here (see A/77/PV.9).@@@Malawi has had the worst cholera outbreak in its history, killing more people than the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), a consequence of the contamination our water bodies and systems suffered when Tropical Storm Ana and Cyclone Gombe hit us six months earlier.@@@In that time.@@@Malawi has also had a drought in its northern region, resulting in the loss of half of our maize and 80 per cent of our rice in one of the most productive districts in our country.@@@In that time.@@@Malawi has also come under assault by the worst cyclone on record, as Freddy made landfall twice and left a trail of death and destruction like you could not believe, killing over 1.000, displacing over half a million, and washing away homes, roads, bridges, businesses and fields of crops that are a source of livelihood for over 2 million people.@@@So when I say that our SDGs are under threat, the threat is real and is already here.@@@What Malawi needs, therefore, is decision and action.@@@We need decision and action on the climate financing that has thus far been nothing more than a promissory note from the developed countries responsible for resourcing our efforts for mitigation, adaptation and, most urgently, loss and damage.@@@We need decision and action on debt, for like most least developed countries (LDCs).@@@Malawi is in distress because its debt is unsustainable, and so our call to action on behalf of all LDCs on this matter remains the same: Cancel the Debts!@@@Cancel the Debts!@@@Cancel the Debts!@@@As a family of nations, we have already lost two years of progress during the Decade of Action due to the economic shutdowns effected to contain COVID-19, and if you want the global economy to regain that lost ground, you must cancel the debts.@@@We have lost another two years of progress during the Decade of Action due to economic disruptions caused by the war in Eastern Europe, and if you want to see EDCs catch up on the SDGs, you must cancel the debts.@@@That is a decision the international community can make today and action it can take that would breathe oxygen into the suffocating economies of the global South.@@@That is a decision the international community can make today so that the money being drained by servicing debts can go towards rebuilding roads, schools, hospitals, businesses and livelihoods.@@@For Malawi’s part, we are committed to continuing to implement reforms and policies aimed at building economic resilience against shocks.@@@We are committed to continuing to engage the United Nations and our development partners, both multilaterally and bilaterally, in mobilizing international support that goes beyond disaster management and seeks to build sustainability.@@@We are committed to continuing to bang on the doors of financial institutions that remain too slow, too unresponsive and too rigid to address the existing financing gaps in the programs we have for achieving the SDGs.@@@We are committed to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and to a rules-based international system, so long as we have the power to change the rules that have worked against us and held back our development for decades
That is why Malawi strongly advocates for radical reform in the Security Council itself, whose very structure undermines the values of democracy, inclusivity, accountability and trust.@@@It is no accident that at this general debate of the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session, focused on rebuilding trust and solidarity, only one Head of State from the permanent members of the Security Council has showed up.@@@That is not how you build trust.@@@That is not how you show solidarity.@@@That is not accountability.@@@That is not leadership.@@@As such.@@@I believe President Biden said it so well here, and Malawi joins the United States in insisting that Africa must have permanent seats on the Security Council with veto power, because without that level of inclusivity, rebuilding trust and reigniting global solidarity will be a challenge.@@@One of the reasons we need a reformed United Nations is because we need a new development paradigm beyond 2030.@@@We need a development paradigm that takes on board the interests of the developing world in the spirit of true partnership.@@@We need a development paradigm that places partnership at the heart of our quest for SDG achievement.@@@We need a development paradigm that promotes competition in matters of human ingenuity, science, technology and innovation, and not in matters of militarization and economic exploitation, which are just new forms of colonization.@@@We need a new paradigm that celebrates and rewards the developed nations that fulfil their commitment to financing climate resilience projects in developing countries.@@@We need a new paradigm that establishes effective carbon markets to empower developing nations like Malawi with the resources necessary for achieving sustainability and implementing their national adaptation plans.@@@We need a new paradigm that builds each continent’s capacity to tackle future pandemics, including vaccine manufacturing capabilities and proactive pandemic preparedness.@@@Most important, we need a new paradigm that unleashes the full potential of our youth and puts them in the driving seat of the vehicles we are using to reach our SDG targets, for the future we are chasing after is theirs, not ours.@@@It is my pleasure to congratulate the President of the General Assembly at its current session.@@@I wish him every success in conducting its work.@@@I also want to express my thanks and appreciation to his predecessor.@@@His Excellency Mr. Csaba Korosi, for his remarkable efforts in leading the previous session, and His Excellency Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for his continuous efforts to achieve the noble purposes and objectives of the United Nations.@@@At the outset.@@@I wish to express the condolences of the King, the Government and the people of the Kingdom of Bahrain to our brothers in the Kingdom of Morocco and the State of Libya over the victims of the earthquake that struck several regions in Morocco and the floods that swept through the Libyan city of Derna.@@@We ask God Almighty to grant the deceased His mercy and wish a speedy recovery for the injured.@@@The general debate of the current session is being held amid global challenges and crises that threaten the development of countries and affect the lives, security.@@@stability and safety of peoples.@@@Foremost among them are the escalation of wars and armed conflicts; the dangers of extremism, terrorism and organized crime; cybersecurity threats, food and water security, climate change and natural and health disasters.@@@Under the leadership of His Majesty King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa and the guidance of the Government, headed by His Royal Highness Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa.@@@Crown Prince and Prime Minister, the Kingdom of Bahrain has demonstrated in all its diplomatic stances and practical efforts its adherence to its deep-rooted human and cultural values.@@@Those values are in line with the objectives of the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law, as well as Bahrain’s commitment to establishing international cooperation and promoting strategic partnerships with friendly and allied countries in order to maintain peace, security and stability and to provide a safe, prosperous and sustainable environment for the benefit of the peoples of the world.@@@The Kingdom of Bahrain has taken confident steps at key historical milestones to strengthen alliances.@@@Those alliances have helped consolidate the international system based on the freedom of trade, ideas and individuals in a way that supports individual freedoms and responsibilities.@@@My country has continued to strengthen its diplomatic relations with brotherly, friendly and allied countries with common interests.@@@Under the leadership of His Majesty the King, it has been keen to deepen bilateral relations at all levels, and has played an important role in the efforts to promote international cooperation.@@@A few days ago, in Washington.@@@His Royal Highness the Crown Prince and Prime Minister signed the Comprehensive Security Integration and Prosperity Agreement with our friend the United States of America.@@@That attests to the Kingdom of Bahrain’s firm strategic approach, which supports peace and stability in the region and is based on the close link between security and prosperity to achieve the desired progress in every aspect of development, in a world where the number of challenges is increasing daily.@@@The Kingdom of Bahrain understands that international cooperation based on mutual trust, good faith and mutual understanding is the best way to overcome shared challenges and has therefore included the following among its top priorities.@@@The first such priority is prioritizing dialogue and a peaceful and civilized approach for ending wars and settling all regional and international differences and disputes, foremost of which is advancing a just, comprehensive and lasting peace process in the Middle East and supporting the rights of the brotherly Palestinian people to establish their independent State, with East Jerusalem as its capital; the strengthening of peaceful coexistence among the peoples of the region, while expressing our support for the extension of the United Nations humanitarian truce in Yemen; achieving sustainable peaceful solutions to the crises in Syria.@@@Lebanon, the Sudan.@@@Libya and Afghanistan, while preserving their unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity, supporting their development and alleviating the suffering of their peoples; and supporting international mediation efforts to achieving peace throughout the world.@@@In that context, we reiterate our call for further efforts to end the war in Ukraine through peaceful negotiations and to avoid escalation in order to meet the interests of the two neighbouring countries and ensure the protection of civilians and respect for international humanitarian law in order to preserve security and peace on the European continent, while attenuating its devastating humanitarian repercussions and addressing its global impact on food security, energy supplies, the environment and nuclear safety.@@@The second priority is establishing international relations based on the principles of good neighbourliness; respect for international law, the sovereignty, stability and territorial integrity of States and their religious and cultural values; and non-interference in their internal affairs.@@@In that regard, we underscore the firm and supportive position of the Kingdom of Bahrain in support of the unity, cohesion, solidarity and unified path of the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf and our appreciation of positive regional developments, such as Syria’s return to the League of Arab States and the resumption of Saudi-Iranian diplomatic relations.@@@The third priority is promoting the values of tolerance and a culture of peace and dialogue among religions, cultures and civilizations, as essential pillars for achieving security, development and respect for human rights.@@@In that regard, we call on the international community to respond effectively to the call of His Majesty the King to adopt an international convention to criminalize religious, sectarian and racial hate speech and prevent the abuse of freedoms on media and 
digital platforms to propagate religious hatred and to incite extremism, terrorism and intolerance.@@@The fourth priority is galvanizing international efforts to overcome shared security challenges through cooperation and coordination in the fight against terrorism, while cutting off its financial sources and countering its ideologies; intensifying efforts to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and ensuring the establishment of the Middle East as a region free of such weapons; cooperating in ensuring the security of commercial shipping and energy supplies in the Gulf region; and combating cybercrime.@@@The fifth priority is deepening international partnerships and strategic dialogue towards building a more stable and just global political, security and economic order, based on solidarity, to achieve peoples’ aspirations to consolidate international peace and security and implement the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@We call on the international community to shoulder its responsibilities by ramping up its efforts and channelling investments and financial resources towards achieving growth and prosperity, eliminating hunger, poverty and water and energy crises and supporting the least-developed countries.@@@We must open markets for their exports without restrictions and alleviate their debt burden so as to ensure prosperity for all peoples, with no one left behind.@@@In that regard, the Kingdom of Bahrain welcomes and endorses the India-Middle East-Europe economic corridor.@@@We look forward to that ambitious strategic project’s contribution to the development and prosperity of the region for the benefit of all its peoples.@@@My country also welcomes the announcement by the sisterly Kingdom of Saudi Arabia of its intent to establish a global water organization, aimed at developing and integrating the efforts of States and organizations to address water challenges in a holistic manner.@@@My country’s Government is keen to promote an effective partnership with the United Nations and its specialized bodies in support of our common development goals.@@@That has been done through the submission and discussion of the fourth national report under the Universal Periodic Review mechanism for human rights and the second report on progress made in implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development at the High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development under the auspices of the Economic and Social Council.@@@Through its own example, the Kingdom of Bahrain has provided a model for political development and the consolidation of the rule of law and institutions within the framework of the separation of powers and their cooperation under its Constitution.@@@The Kingdom is proud of its Council of Representatives exercising its legislative and oversight powers and expressing the will of citizens following the success of parliamentary elections in six successive sessions, the most recent of which took place last year, with more than 73 per cent voter participation.@@@We are also proud of having ensured justice within the framework of an impartial and independent judiciary, supported by independent human rights institutions, such as the National Human Rights Institution and Office of the Ombudsman, the Prisoners and Detainees Rights Commission and the Special Investigation Unit of the Public Prosecutor, as well as promoting the freedom of the press and media and the role of trade unions and civil society through 660 civil and political associations.@@@The Kingdom of Bahrain is proud of the establishment of its pioneering modern legislative system, which has promoted respect for human rights and championed political and civil liberties, particularly through the enactment and implementation of the Alternative Sanctions and Measures Law, the open prisons programme and the substitution of non-custodial penalties for prison sentences.@@@Those measures have benefited more than 5.500 convicted persons since their implementation in May 2018, keeping pace with the latest criminal justice systems in reforming and enabling convicts to be reintegrated into society.@@@In addition, we have adopted the Law on Restorative Justice for Children and their Protection from Maltreatment, for which the Judicial Committee for Childhood, courts and the office of the Specialized Prosecutor for the Child were established.@@@Within the framework of coordination between the legislative and executive authorities, my country is working to implement the government programme for the sixth legislative term.@@@Its top priorities are promoting security, stability and justice; supporting the economic recovery plan; providing quality and competitive government services and integrating them with the Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@Thanks to the wisdom of its leadership, the awareness of its people and its commitment to the spirit of Team Bahrain in turning challenges into sustainable achievements, the Kingdom has set a humane and civilized example in combating the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and overcoming its impacts.@@@That was achieved through providing comprehensive 
health and treatment services and free examinations for all citizens and residents, which has been acknowledged by the World Health Organization, which cited Manama as the first healthy city in the Middle East.@@@It was also achieved through the implementation of five financial and economic packages through 40 initiatives supporting individuals, the private sector and the most- affected sectors, amounting to $12 billion, the equivalent of one-third of the Kingdom’s gross domestic product.@@@My country’s Government continues the implementation of the economic recovery plan and its programmes to accelerate the provision of employment opportunities for citizens; the construction of five new housing cities; the modernization of trade and financial legislation and procedures; economic openness and diversity; and the implementation of health, education, tourism and technical development strategies and projects.@@@Over the past year, we have achieved a net economic growth rate of nearly 5 per cent; an increase to 83 per cent in the contribution of the non-oil sector to our gross domestic product; and a rise in foreign direct investment to $35.5 billion, according to a report by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.@@@The Kingdom of Bahrain has also promoted its prestigious international standing according to international indicators, moving up to second place in the Arab world and thirty-fifth place internationally on the list of countries with very high human development, according to a report by the United Nations Development Programme.@@@It ranks first in the Arab world and twenty- first internationally in the 2022 World Happiness Report, issued by the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network.@@@It also ranked thirty-fourth globally in the Logistics Performance Index of the World Bank and first in the Middle East and North Africa region in the Economic Freedom of the world index issued by the Eraser Institute.@@@My country also shares its entrepreneurial experience with 48 countries, in collaboration with the United Nations Industrial Development Organization.@@@The Kingdom of Bahrain has made great strides in the area of digital transformation by assuming the presidency of the Digital Cooperation Organization and becoming a member of the Council of the International Telecommunication Union.@@@It has been classified among the leading countries in digital government, ranking first globally in Internet distribution, according to the World Bank.@@@It also has a high e-government development rate according to the United Nations.@@@That is evidenced by our provision of more than 600 Government services through online platforms and 100 per cent coverage of fifth-generation networks.@@@That is evidenced also through our adoption of a national strategy to support the transformation of the fourth industrial revolution and the digital economy, and our investment in future sciences by establishing the National Space Science Agency and launching the first completely Bahraini- built satellite.@@@In that regard, we are pleased to congratulate the sisterly United Arab Emirates on its outstanding progress in the space domain.@@@We congratulate it on the successful return of Emirati astronaut Sultan Al-Neyadi to Earth, who achieved a significant scientific milestone as the first Arab to complete a spacewalk outside of the International Space Station.@@@The Kingdom of Bahrain has maintained its first- place ranking among Arab countries on the Basel Anti-Money-Laundering Index, including with regard to terrorist financing, complementing its active role in establishing and hosting the Middle East and North Africa Financial Action Task Force.@@@It has also retained its prestigious tier 1 status for the sixth consecutive year in the United States Department of State report on trafficking in persons.@@@In addition, my country has garnered international acclaim for its human rights record, its cybersecurity readiness and its role in the fight against illicit drug trafficking and in tackling various economic and cyber-related crimes.@@@The Kingdom of Bahrain is proud of the advancement of women and their contributions as active partners in the process of comprehensive development achievements, whether as ministers, parliamentarians, judges or ambassadors.@@@Bahraini women represent 22 per cent of the Cabinet; 23 per cent of the members of the legislative authority; 56 per cent of the national workforce in the e-government sector; 35 per cent of the private sector; and 34 per cent of diplomatic personnel.@@@That is among other positive indicators that reflect the efforts of the Supreme Council for Women and its initiatives in the context of the national plan for the advancement of Bahraini women, along with other national plans, strategies and legislation to protect the rights of women, the family and children; to provide care, rehabilitation and employment for persons with disabilities; to ensure the rights of elderly people; and to protect against domestic violence and promote the social protection system.@@@Proceeding from our belief in the right of people to a healthy, clean and sustainable environment, the Kingdom of Bahrain reaffirms its support for international initiatives in the field of climate change.@@@We are committed to achieving net-zero carbon neutrality by 2060; reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 2035; doubling the number of trees and, in particular, quadrupling the number of mangroves, by 2035; improving energy efficiency and promoting renewable sources of energy; and protecting biodiversity.@@@We would like to wish the United Arab Emirates every success in organizing and presiding over the twenty-eighth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change at the end of the year.@@@Peace is our strategic choice for a safer, more stable and more prosperous world.@@@We firmly believe that peace is the path to constructive cooperation and peaceful coexistence among nations and peoples.@@@We recognize that, given the inevitability of living together, dialogue and harmony must prevail over disputes and conflict, based on our belief in the right of all human beings to freedom, justice, prosperity and human dignity without any discrimination pertaining to race, origin, language, religion or belief.@@@In that regard, the Kingdom of Bahrain, in the light of the noble initiatives of His Majesty the King, is proud of its success in sharing its pioneering experience with the world in terms of tolerance, peaceful coexistence, respect for human rights and in encouraging the values of solidarity and international humanitarian and development work at various levels.@@@First.@@@I would mention the issuance of the Kingdom of Bahrain declaration on freedom of religion and belief, the establishment of the King Hamad Global Centre for Peaceful Coexistence and the continued wise initiatives of His Majesty the King to promote tolerance, dialogue and religious and cultural rapprochement.@@@Secondly, the Kingdom has hosted regional and international conferences to promote regional security and dialogue among religions, sects and cultures, the most recent of which was the Bahrain Forum for Dialogue, held under the theme “East and West for Human Coexistence”, with the participation of His Holiness the Pope and the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar.@@@We have also hosted the General Assembly meeting of the Inter-Parliamentary Union on promoting peaceful coexistence and inclusive societies, with a focus on combating intolerance.@@@That reflects the firm and deep- rooted principles of the Kingdom of Bahrain with regard to respect for cultural, ethnic and religious diversity, as well as its historical and cultural heritage spanning more than 5.000 years.@@@Thirdly, the Kingdom continues to actively contribute to supporting the objectives of the United Nations by offering international awards for the promotion of dialogue and peaceful coexistence, for the service of humankind, for digital transformation in the field of education and for the empowerment of women and youth in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@My country also established an initiative on the International Days of Conscience and of Islamic Art.@@@Moreover, we have delivered humanitarian and relief assistance to many countries affected by the repercussions of wars, conflicts and natural disasters through the efforts of the Royal Humanitarian Foundation and the Bahrain Red Crescent Society.@@@Under the reformist, humanitarian and diplomatic approach of His Majesty the King, with the support and follow-up of His Royal Highness the Crown Prince and Prime Minister and the commitment of its loyal and dedicated people, the Kingdom of Bahrain continues to maximize its developmental and civilizational gains, to reinforce its noble values and cultural achievements and to enhance its active role in strengthening international solidarity.@@@Our aim is a stable and secure world free from tension and hatred that advances with affection, tolerance, brotherhood and cooperation for the benefit of humankind.@@@We hope to build a bright future for generations to come.@@@I congratulate the President on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session and assure him of Uganda’s full support.@@@I would like to thank Mr. Csaba Korosi for his stewardship of the seventy-seventh session.@@@I pay tribute to the Secretary-General.@@@Mr. Antonio Guterres, for his leadership and commitment to the work of the United Nations.@@@As we mark 78 years of the existence of the United Nations, we yearn for a revitalized Organization that is capable of addressing current and emerging global challenges.@@@We believe that multilateralism remains a fundamental and crucial mechanism for addressing our common challenges together as nations in solidarity.@@@We pledge to work together with the entire membership of the United Nations to make our Organization fit for purpose and relevant for our times.@@@In that regard.@@@Uganda remains committed to the reform of the Security Council to make it more representative and to 
address the historical injustices committed against the people of Africa, as spelled out by the Common African Position and enshrined in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration.@@@Uganda acknowledges that the timely and full implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is crucial for the achievement of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).@@@In that regard, the Government has continued to take bold actions to accelerate the implementation of the 2030 Agenda nationally.@@@Notable actions include the operationalization of voluntary local reviews and the institution of a national sustainable development goals conference, which is held annually with the participation of all stakeholders, to discuss the progress achieved to date and agree on actions to ensure full compliance.@@@Nationally, we continue to register steady progress in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, the progress of which will be documented in the third voluntary national review report to be submitted to the High- Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development, which will be convened by the Economic and Social Council in July 2024.@@@Peace and security are fundamental and crucial for achieving sustainable development.@@@Therefore, we need to reflect on the original purposes of the United Nations and work to resolve human-made conflicts and global insecurity through cooperation, diplomacy and peaceful means.@@@In that regard.@@@Uganda has continued to work with partners to support and advance peace, stability and security initiatives in the region and beyond so as to eliminate terrorism, mistrust and other conditions that undermine development.@@@We remain actively involved in regional initiatives, particularly those under the African Union, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, the East African Community and the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region.@@@Our involvement is based on the fundamental values of multilateralism.@@@As the international community, we must be steadfast in our resolve to support dialogue and the peaceful resolution of conflicts, wherever they occur around us and anywhere else in the world.@@@Uganda has been at the forefront of receiving large numbers of refugees from within the region and ranks as one of the top refugee-hosting countries.@@@Uganda extends its gratitude to the States Members of the United Nations and other development partners for the support and assistance rendered to the country and refugees, respectively.@@@We are working closely with the United Nations and partners to address the root causes of displacement.@@@Uganda remains committed to shouldering its responsibilities and obligations in addressing the plight of refugees, as a pioneer of the progressive refugee policy outlined in the Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework.@@@As one of the co-conveners of the Global Refugee Forum, we commend all States and other actors for their sustained commitment over the past three years, and we call upon Member States and stakeholders to continue their commitment to pledging towards initiatives that advance the principle of burden- and responsibility sharing, which is central to the Global Compact on Refugees, at the forthcoming Global Refugee Forum.@@@The Constitution of Uganda provides for the protection of the rights and freedoms of all Ugandans, as well as for the promotion of culture.@@@Uganda has institutional safeguards that address grievances of human rights abuses.@@@Objective XXIV of the Constitution states that cultural and customary values are consistent with fundamental human rights and freedoms, human dignity and democracy.@@@Our approach to human rights is to respect other people’s values, and we expect others to respect our values, which are deeply rooted in our culture.@@@We therefore call for mutual respect of sovereignty.@@@We believe that human rights considerations, especially in the face of varying cultural values, should not become the moderating factor in our long-term relationship with our development partners, with which we will continue to engage in a proactive manner.@@@With regard to gender equality, more than 34.9 per cent of the parliamentary and executive seats in Uganda are held by women.@@@In order to promote economic empowerment.@@@Uganda has embarked on poverty alleviation programmes, which target the participation of women and young people in the economy.@@@We are currently promoting value addition, value chain and public procurement from Uganda’s various women’s entrepreneurship programmes.@@@With the creation of the African Continental Free Trade Area, women will participate in cross-border trade within the Area.@@@However, work still needs to be done in Uganda to achieve full gender equality.@@@Climate change continues to undermine the ability of all nations to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@Globally, we continue to witness climate and weather extremes, which are causing considerable loss of life and property.@@@We remain concerned that countries that have contributed less to the global emission of greenhouse gases continue to be disproportionately affected by the impacts of climate change.@@@In that connection, my country extends its sincere condolences to the people of Morocco following the devastating 6.8 magnitude earthquake that claimed more than 800 lives, and to the people of Libya in the aftermath of Storm Daniel, which resulted in unprecedented flooding and loss of life.@@@To address the adverse impacts of climate change.@@@Uganda continues to take bold climate adaptation and mitigation measures in line with our ambitious updated nationally determined contributions, including by increasing access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern forms of energy to enhance production and value addition; increasing forest and wetland cover; and championing the operationalization of climate-smart agriculture.@@@However, we note that the lack of sufficient means of implementation continues to undermine our efforts to adequately address the impacts of climate change.@@@We therefore reiterate our call on developed country parties to fulfil their commitment, in line with the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, to provide $100 billion annually to developing country parties through 2025 to assist them with mitigation and adaptation.@@@We remain deeply concerned by the increasing trend of biodiversity loss.@@@We believe that the full and timely implementation of the decisions adopted at the fifteenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity is fundamental to effectively address biodiversity loss.@@@In that context, the Government of Uganda has continued to take bold actions to address biodiversity loss, including the complete restoration of all degraded wetlands, reforestation and the prosecution of those involved in illegal activities that undermine the preservation of flora and fauna.@@@Our view is that the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity remains a commitment for all nations and humankind.@@@We therefore urge the international community to provide developing countries with sufficient means of implementation, in terms of financing, capacity-building and technology transfer, to support their efforts to address the challenges of biodiversity loss.@@@Developing countries continue to face unprecedented financing challenges that undermine their ability to achieve sustainable development.@@@We believe that the urgent need to reform the international financial architecture is fundamental and crucial in addressing those challenges.@@@Those reforms must be substantial in order to ensure that developing countries are well represented and can effectively and efficiently participate in the decision-making processes of those international financial institutions.@@@Our view is that those international financial institutions should support developing countries in their development efforts, in accordance with their national policies and legal frameworks.@@@The coronavirus disease pandemic presented a multitude of challenges to global health systems and essential health services.@@@The crisis not only reversed hard-fought health gains but has also inflicted severe economic hardships, especially in developing countries such as Uganda.@@@We have witnessed widespread job losses, disruptions in supply chains, reduced foreign investments and increased poverty rates.@@@Those economic setbacks further exacerbate the existing challenges of implementing the 2030 Agenda.@@@In Uganda, for instance, despite earlier progress, access to universal health care today stands at 65 per cent, which is well short of the SDG target of 100 per cent.@@@The crisis, while daunting, also presents opportunities for us to rethink and reinforce our commitment to health care and the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@Despite the challenges.@@@I am happy to report that Uganda has registered positive achievements in some effective disease control measures, as demonstrated by its swift and successful response to the Ebola outbreak.@@@Through diligent efforts and the collaboration of health-care professionals and the Government.@@@Uganda declared the end of the Ebola outbreak caused by the Sudan ebola virus on 11 January 2023, just four months after the first case was confirmed in September 2022.@@@That accomplishment underscores the importance of surveillance, contact tracing and infection prevention and control in swiftly mitigating public health crises.@@@By working together and capitalizing on the expertise and infrastructure developed in those areas, we can collectively contribute to a healthier, more resilient world.@@@The Movement of Non-Aligned Countries (NAM) remains a key player in handling current and emerging global challenges at the United Nations.@@@The Movement remains relevant in serving the interests of its member States, in line with its founding principles and purposes.@@@In that regard.@@@Uganda, as the incoming Chair of NAM, will work closely with other NAM countries to further strengthen the tenets and values of the Organization and the important role that the Movement plays at the United Nations and other international forums.@@@As host of the nineteenth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Non-Aligned Movement, we look forward to welcoming the NAM Heads of State and Government to Kampala from 19 to 20 January 2024.@@@Finally.@@@South-South cooperation remains a strong element of international cooperation among the countries of the global South; such cooperation must be enhanced.@@@We continue to witness the solidarity exhibited by countries in the global South in extending support to their global counterparts to address multiple challenges.@@@We therefore commend those countries for their solidarity.@@@Uganda will continue to support the strengthening of South-South, triangular and North-South cooperation at the United Nations.@@@As host country of the third South Summit, to be held in Kampala from 21 to 23 January 2024, we look forward to welcoming the leaders of the Group of 77 and China.@@@We are a young, imperfect and vibrant democracy, an oasis of peace, tolerance and freedom.@@@Since we gained independence in 2002, our democracy has evolved, alive and dynamic.@@@The Economist magazine’s Democracy Index rates Timor-Leste as the most democratic country in South-East Asia; the organization Reporters Without Borders, in its most recent World Press Freedom Index, places Timor-Leste in tenth place worldwide in terms of press freedom.@@@We are a multicultural, multi-religious, multilingual and multiethnic society.@@@With humility, we continue to build a country open to the world, tolerant and free from hate and violence.@@@Our practicing Catholics, representing 98 per cent of the population, live in harmony with our Protestant and Muslim brothers and sisters.@@@Timor-Leste has no political violence or tensions or crimes based on ethnicity or religion.@@@We have no domestic organized crime or armed robbery.@@@Despite a significant reduction in poverty, multidimensional poverty remains high, at 45.8 per cent, and even higher among children.@@@Lifting our people out of extreme poverty, food insecurity, neonatal mortality.@@@stunting and child malnutrition, and providing child and maternal care are some of the challenges that we are determined to face head on over the next five years.@@@For that reason, child malnutrition and access to pre-school education are two of our main priorities.@@@In collaboration with UNICEF, the Government intends to implement an intersectoral early childhood development policy to promote investments in the first years of life and build a solid foundation for social and human capital.@@@We have a high and unacceptable incidence of domestic violence.@@@UN-Women recognizes, however, that Timor-Leste is taking significant steps in implementing international legal and policy frameworks, including the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), to promote gender equality and women’s empowerment.@@@We are an observer State in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), with the right to participate in all summits of Heads of State and Government, ministerial meetings and senior officials and technical meetings.@@@In the 20 years since independence and the 10 years since we formally requested membership in ASEAN, most economic and social indicators show significant progress, including in life expectancy, which was less than 60 years in 2002 and is now at 70, and a reduction in poverty and infant mortality.@@@From 21 doctors in 2002, we now have more than 1.200.@@@In 2002, the capital had partial electric coverage, while the rest of the country did not enjoy that privilege.@@@Currently, power is available in 96.1 per cent of our territory.@@@We are very grateful for the unanimous decision of ASEAN leaders to grant observer status to Timor-Leste, a pathway to membership and a comprehensive support package to continue training our staff and diplomats.@@@We do not depend on outside help and are eternally grateful to those who helped us in our times of greatest need.@@@We finance our own national budget from the returns of a sovereign wealth fund invested in United States Treasury Bonds and global financial markets, with an annual return of over 9 per cent.@@@Timor-Leste is an active member of the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries and is a co-founder of the international g7+ group, which was established in 2010 in Dili, has a membership of 20 conflict-affected countries and is currently chaired by Sierra Leone.@@@Global crises such as pandemics, climate change, the war on Ukraine and the resulting geopolitical fragmentation have disproportionately impacted already fragile and conflict-affected countries.@@@They have always felt the brunt of every global crisis.@@@On the other hand, those countries are the least responsible for those crises.@@@The incidence of extreme hunger, poverty and humanitarian crises caused by wars, climate change and geoeconomic fragmentation is increasingly concentrated in fragile and conflict-affected countries.@@@Armed conflicts proliferate and economic and social conditions are worsening in countries around the world, but we seem to have forgotten the children of the tragedies of Myanmar.@@@Afghanistan.@@@Yemen.@@@Syria.@@@Palestine and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.@@@The growing tensions among regional and global Powers are eroding the potential of our collective security institutions at a time when we face existential challenges.@@@We cannot accept incomprehensible anachronisms, such as the embargo imposed on the Cuban people, the continuing impasse in the Western Sahara conflict and the blatant disregard of United Nations resolutions on the two-State solution for Israel and Palestine.@@@On and off, we hear about the need to reform the Security Council.@@@Academics concoct an expanded Security Council, regurgitating ideas for a more representative body reflecting today’s demographics, which is in itself an almost surreal task, bearing in mind that leaders up to the present have not ended the nuclear arms race, remained the biggest arms merchants of death, led in the desecration of Mother Nature, failed to help the poorest out of poverty, and have not shown the wisdom to write off the debt incurred by countries of the poorer South, a burden caused by loan sharks from Western commercial banks.@@@Children living in conflict zones continue to come under attack on an alarming scale.@@@Recent years have seen an exacerbation of children’s vulnerability to grave violations.@@@In Myanmar, unable to control the ground, the military pursues a scorched-earth strategy with the widespread use of aircraft and helicopters targeting civilians across the country.@@@At least 3.000 civilians have 
been killed and 17.000 people arbitrarily imprisoned, including legitimately elected leaders such as Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.@@@Timor-Leste condemns the invasion and the violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine and the ongoing war, with its catastrophic consequences not only for the Ukrainian people, but also for the Russians and the rest of the world, with the disruption of global trade in grain and energy.@@@We know from experience and history that wars are very seldom won on the battlefield, miscalculations and false pride prevail, and the war goes on for years and killings and utter destruction continue until exhaustion; only then do the sides involved decide to begin negotiations on a peace settlement.@@@Why not talk now?@@@People living in fragile circumstances are already feeling the effects of climate change most severely.@@@We need a new outlook on the climate and security nexus that will address the impacts of climate change and environmental degradation on peace and security and ensure that the quest for energy transition does not exacerbate the security situation in vulnerable and fragile countries.@@@Therefore, we propose a bold initiative that would seek to accelerate the just energy transition in fragile developing States that rely heavily on oil and gas production to prevent turmoil and unrest.@@@The combined efforts of unlocking finance through debt alleviation, streamlining international finance at the lowest interest rates, and significantly increasing official development assistance will empower those nations to embark on projects that foster the development of clean industries, address the ongoing loss and damage related to climate change, and facilitate their efforts in greenhouse gas mitigation and adaptation to climate change.@@@While initiatives to further the just transition exist, they do not pay enough attention to fragile or vulnerable States, least developed countries (LDCs) or small island developing States.@@@As a second priority, the initiative would pay urgent attention to the particular challenges faced by fragile States that are susceptible not only to fragility and vulnerability on their own but also where there is heightened risk when faced with any massive economic turmoil, which the green transition — if not handled carefully — could increase.@@@Thirdly, as the urgent need to transition to a low- carbon economy and clean energy accelerates, the initiative would seek to ensure that the quest for rare earth elements and critical minerals does not lead to further instability, promote weak governance or exacerbate local tensions or grievances in the countries where the strategic reserves of such elements and minerals are found.@@@The initiative seeks to create a brighter and more sustainable future for our planet and all its inhabitants.@@@By facilitating the energy transition in small island developing States.@@@LDCs and vulnerable nations, we aim to mitigate climate change impacts and preserve our shared global environment for generations to come.@@@In the face of the agony of poverty and rising costs in the most impoverished countries, the super-rich chief executive officers of banks and creditor countries remain indifferent to calls for debt cancellation.@@@I insist here that Banks and other credit institutions cancel this damned debt.@@@It would be a leap forward in international solidarity if all members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development were to allocate 1 per cent of their national gross domestic product to official development assistance (ODA).@@@We would see positive effects on poverty rates, food security and access to basic health services, education, electricity, drinking water, sanitation, housing and social security, with multiplier effects on the diversification of economies, especially in agriculture.@@@We live in a universe full of dualities: an increasingly prosperous world whose wealth has increased by $30 trillion a year, according to Nobel Prize winner Kailash Satyarthi, but where the leaderships of the Group of Seven or the Group of 20 fail to reflect that in the fight against hunger, stunting and other forms of multidimensional poverty.@@@We need to adopt a universal child benefit and a new ODA target for a fair share for children, particularly targeting children in fragile low- income countries.@@@Allow me to recall a story that is no longer part of our daily conversation — the story of three-year-old Aylan Kurdi, an innocent Syrian baby whose lifeless body washed ashore near the Turkish resort town of Bodrum in September 2015.@@@How many of us are pained by the sight of children dying everyday of hunger and in ongoing wars?@@@In centuries past, the Atlantic Ocean was the graveyard of African slaves, and those who survived the voyage built new countries with their sweat and blood.@@@In the twenty-first century, the Mediterranean 
Sea is the new graveyard of thousands of Africans, fleeing drought, extreme poverty and conflicts.@@@No one should fear the Chinese.@@@Indian.@@@European and American super-Powers.@@@Rather, we should welcome the positive reality of global countries that share with us diasporas, cultures and interests in wellbeing or security that are deeply intertwined with our own.@@@We can gain more from the free movement of people and goods than from building concrete walls.@@@We all benefit from the impressive transformation of India into a global economic success story.@@@India has an admirable track record of decades of practical solidarity with other developing countries, even during the early stages of its own development.@@@Equally we want to see prosperity in Europe.@@@Japan.@@@South Korea and Australia.@@@But their continuing prosperity depends on peace and stability in the global South and on our markets, workforce and providers of the raw wealth that they process and re-export.@@@But that unequal relationship has to change and will change only when we invest more in high-quality education and health care for our children and youth and when we invest more in science and technology.@@@We have the chance of the century to build a new partnership of equals between the super-rich of the North and us on the periphery, with a renewed spirit of mission around the global causes of nature and human survival.@@@Failing that, we will sink together, rich and poor, the weak and the powerful.@@@At present, the international security situation is grim, economic recovery lacks momentum and the development gap is widening.@@@Natural disasters and extreme weather patterns are increasing.@@@The global order faces multiple challenges.@@@Facing profound changes in the world, in our times and in history.@@@Chinese President Xi Jinping made a major call of building a community with a shared future for mankind, and he called on the international community to jointly build a world with lasting peace, universal security and common prosperity, a world that is open, inclusive, clean and beautiful.@@@Since then.@@@President Xi Jinping has proposed the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative.@@@Those Initiatives have enriched the vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind and set out a pathway towards realizing this goal.@@@More and more countries have realized that they all share a huge stake in common survival and that unity and cooperation is the right path.@@@The historical trend of peace, development and win-win cooperation is unstoppable.@@@With that in mind.@@@I call for taking steps in four areas.@@@First, we should uphold equity and justice and safeguard peace and security.@@@The security of all countries is interconnected.@@@Indeed, the security of one country has an impact on that of other countries.@@@It is important to follow the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security and embark on a path to security featuring dialogue over confrontation, partnership over alliance and win-win outcomes over a zero-sum game.@@@We should address the legitimate security concerns of all countries and resolve differences and disputes in a peaceful way through dialogue and consultation.@@@Communication and dialogue is an important way to achieve international security cooperation, and parties to a conflict or confrontation should never forget that.@@@The cessation of hostilities and resumption of peace talks is the only way to settle the Ukraine crisis.@@@China supports all efforts that are conducive to the peaceful resolution of the Ukraine crisis and stands ready to continue playing a constructive role for the early attainment of peace.@@@The Palestinian issue is at the core of the Middle East issue.@@@The fundamental way out lies in the two- State solution.@@@China will continue to support the Palestinian people in pursuing the just cause of restoring their lawful national rights.@@@We should respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries and observe the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.@@@China opposes hegemonism, power politics, unilateralism and Cold War mentality.@@@A small number of countries have arbitrarily imposed illegal and unilateral sanctions, severely undermining the harmony and stability of international relations.@@@The international community should jointly resist such acts.@@@China firmly supports the Cuban people in their just struggle to defend their sovereignty and oppose external interference and blockade.@@@We appreciate Cuba’s efforts to fight terrorism.@@@We should maintain security in both traditional and non-traditional domains.@@@Nuclear war must not be fought, and nuclear weapons must not be used.@@@China is the only country among the five permanent members of the Security Council that has pledged no-first-use of nuclear weapons.@@@China attaches great importance to conventional arms control and will soon complete its ratification of the Protocol against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms.@@@Their Parts and Components and Ammunition, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime.@@@China will collaborate with the countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in de-mining efforts, over the next three years, so as to help them eliminate mines at an early date.@@@China supports the United Nations in serving as 
the main channel to create a widely accepted artificial intelligence governance framework, standards and norms, on the basis of full respect for the governance principles and practices of all countries.@@@Secondly, we should pursue mutual benefit, deliver win-win outcomes and achieve development for all.@@@Development should be placed at the centre of the international agenda, and development benefits should reach every country and individual in a fairer way.@@@China will continue to contribute to building a global community of development.@@@This year marks the tenth anniversary of the Belt and Road Initiative put forward by China.@@@More than 3.000 cooperation projects have been launched under the framework of this initiative.@@@The China-Europe Railway Express had 16.000 freight services in 2022, which fully demonstrates the vitality of the Belt and Road Initiative.@@@Next month.@@@China will host the third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation.@@@We will further advance both Belt and Road cooperation and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@We should fully and effectively implement the Paris Agreement.@@@Developed countries should do more to reduce emissions and provide developing countries with financing, technology and capacity-building support.@@@China will continue to pursue ecological conservation on a priority basis, advance green and low-carbon development, stop building new coal-fired power projects abroad, vigorously support other developing countries in developing green and low-carbon energy and help them build more green energy projects.@@@China will continue to actively respond to climate change.@@@Thirdly, we should stay open and inclusive and advance human civilization.@@@Diversity of civilizations is an invaluable asset for human development; indeed, diversity is a defining feature of human civilization.@@@Different countries and civilizations should prosper together by respecting each other, advance together by drawing on each other’s strengths and seek win-win outcomes by pursuing common ground, while setting aside differences.@@@Promoting and protecting human rights is a cause pursued by all countries, and ensuring a good life for people is the ultimate human right.@@@As countries have different histories, traditions and conditions, we must and can only explore a path of human rights development suited to our national conditions in response to the needs of our people.@@@We should advance the international human rights cause through dialogue and cooperation and oppose politicization and double standards, in particular through the use of human rights and democracy as a political tool to interfere in the affairs of other countries.@@@Fourthly, we should stay true to multilateralism and improve global governance.@@@China is firm in supporting the international system, with the United Nations at its core.@@@The United Nations should make advances in all the three pillar areas of security, development and human rights, in a balanced manner, and see that all countries jointly safeguard universal security, share development achievements and chart the course for the future of the world.@@@Major countries should lead by example and deliver on their commitment to multilateralism.@@@Next year, the United Nations will hold the Summit of the Future.@@@The international community should follow the direction of a multipolar world and democracy in international relations, use this occasion to promote reform in such areas as peace and security, economy, finance and trade in a coordinated manner, increase the representation and say of developing countries and make global governance more just and equitable.@@@In October, the Communist Party of China convened its Twentieth National Congress, at which an inspiring blueprint to achieve great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on all fronts by pursuing Chinese modernization was presented.@@@Chinese modernization involves a huge population.@@@It aims to deliver prosperity for all the Chinese people, promote ethical, material and cultural advancement, and achieve harmony between humankind and nature and a peaceful development.@@@By pursuing Chinese modernization, we will promote world peace and development and make new and greater contributions to the advancement of human civilization.@@@China remains committed to more fully opening itself to the world.@@@Today the Chinese economy is already an integral part of the global economy.@@@We will continue to expand that by opening up in a systematic way in order to promote trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, open the market further to foreign investment and protect the lawful rights and interests of foreign investors.@@@We will continue to add new momentum to global economic development, and we welcome all countries to share in the opportunities and benefits created by China’s development.@@@China remains committed to an independent foreign policy.@@@Independence is the defining feature of China’s diplomacy and defiance of hegemony is a distinctive feature of China’s diplomacy.@@@No matter what stage 
of development it reaches.@@@China will never practice hegemony and expansion.@@@China will uphold the common values of humankind — peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom — and will continue to advance a peaceful, open, cooperative and common development.@@@China remains committed to safeguarding its sovereignty and territorial integrity.@@@There is only one China in the world.@@@The Government of the People’s Republic of China is the sole legal Government representing the whole of China, and Taiwan has been an inalienable part of China’s territory since ancient times.@@@No one and no force should ever underestimate the firm resolve, the strong will and the power of the Chinese people to safeguard their sovereignty and territorial integrity.@@@Realizing China’s complete reunification is a shared aspiration of all the sons and daughters of the Chinese nation.@@@We will continue to strive for peaceful reunification with the greatest sincerity and the utmost effort.@@@China will remain a member of the large family of developing countries.@@@As the largest developing country.@@@China is a natural member of the global South.@@@It breathes the same air as other developing countries and shares the same future with them.@@@China is firm in upholding the legitimate rights and interests of developing countries.@@@It supports and respects their efforts to independently decide on their development paths, in keeping with their national conditions.@@@China will work unremittingly to promote the building of a community with a shared future for humankind, with a view to fulfilling the mission of a major country and responsibility for the future of humankind.@@@China will work with all other peace-loving countries committed to development in order to deliver a brighter future for the world.@@@It is an honour for me to represent Italy before this General Assembly of the United Nations — an honour that is, however, not light like privilege, but heavy like the weight of responsibility.@@@We are living in complex times of continuous emergencies and change, and we cannot afford the luxury of words of circumstance, of lofty principles that have never been realized and of easy choices in place of the right ones.@@@We need to look back at the profound meaning of what gave life to this place — the community of nations and peoples that are reflected in the 1945 Charter of the United Nations, which was established to find shared solutions that could guarantee peace and prosperity.@@@There are basically two fundamental premises that give meaning to these halls.@@@On the one hand, there are nations that exist because they reflect humankind’s innate need to feel a sense of belonging to a community and to a certain people and to be able to share with others the same historical memory, the same laws and the same customs and traditions — in a word, one’s identity.@@@On the other hand, there is the aspiration of nations that are different from each other to find a place in which to resolve international disputes through an instrument that may be more difficult to use, but is definitely more effective than resorting to force, that is, the instrument of reason.@@@If those two premises — the nation and reason — are still the foundation of our action, we must reject the utopic and self-serving narrative of those who say that a world without nations, without borders and without 
identity would be a world without war and conflict.@@@Just as fiercely, we must thwart the return to the use of force as a tool to resolve international conflict.@@@Russia’s war of invasion of Ukraine tells us precisely this — that over those who want to take us back to a world of dominion and neo-imperial wars, which we thought we had done away with in the past century, reason can still prevail and the love of country and the value of the nation can still be safeguarded from the unimaginable.@@@It is up to us, each and every one of us, to decide on what side of history we want to stand in good conscience.@@@But let us not fool ourselves, because this is what is at stake — the choice between nation and chaos and between reason and prevarication.@@@Italy made a clear choice as to where it stands.@@@It did so out of a sense of justice and because it is aware of how difficult it would be to govern a world in which the upper hand is given to those who bombard civilian infrastructure, hoping to bring a people to its knees with cold and darkness, and to those who weaponize energy and blackmail developing nations, blocking exports of grain — the raw material needed to feed millions of people.@@@The repercussions of the conflict in Ukraine overwhelm us all like a domino effect, but they mainly impact nations of the global South.@@@It is a war waged not only against Ukraine, but against the poorest nations.@@@Italy’s attention is particularly focused on Africa, where nations already beleaguered by long periods of drought and by the effects of climate change now face a situation compounded by food insecurity, making them more vulnerable to instability and an easier prey for terrorism and fundamentalism.@@@That is a choice — to create chaos and spread it.@@@Criminal networks that profit from desperation to collect easy billions infiltrate such chaos, which produces tens of millions of people potentially in search of better living conditions.@@@They are traffickers of human beings, who organize the trade of illegal mass immigration.@@@They deceive those who rely on them to migrate to find a better life, having them pay thousands of dollars for trips to Europe that they sell through brochures as if they were normal travel agencies.@@@But those brochures do not say that all too often those trips can lead to death and to a grave at the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea, because they do not care whether or not the boat used is unfit for that kind of travel.@@@The only important thing for them is the profit margin.@@@Those are the people who, owing to a certain hypocritical approach to the issue of immigration, have become rich beyond measure.@@@We want to wage battle against the mafia in all its forms, and we will battle against that too.@@@The fact is that the fight against organized crime should be an objective that unites us all, and that also invests the United Nations and this very place.@@@Can an Organization like this, which reaffirms faith in the dignity and worth of the human person in its founding act, turn a blind eye to such tragedy?@@@Can we really pretend to not see that no other criminal activity in the world today is more lucrative than the trafficking in migrants when it is United Nations reports themselves that have shown how, by volume of money, that business has reached the same level as drug trafficking and has largely surpassed that of arms trafficking?@@@Can this Assembly of the United Nations, which in other times was fundamental to definitively eradicating the universal crime of slavery, today tolerate its comeback under other guises, that the commercialization of human life continues, that there are women brought to Europe who are forced into prostitution to repay the enormous debt that they incur with their traffickers, or that there are men thrust into the hands of organized crime?@@@Can we really say that it is solidarity to receive, as a priority, not those who are truly entitled and have a need, but those who can afford to pay the traffickers and to allow those criminals to establish who has the right to be saved and who does not?@@@I do not think so.@@@I believe that it is the duty of this Organization to reject any hypocritical approach to this issue and wage a global war without mercy against traffickers in human beings.@@@To do that, we must work together at every level.@@@Italy plans to be on the front line in that regard.@@@With the Rome process, launched in July at the International Conference on Migration and Development, we have engaged Mediterranean and various African nations in a process that follows two main paths: on the one hand, defeating the slave traders of the third millennium and, on the other hand, tackling the root causes of migration, with the objective of guaranteeing the primary right, that is, the right not to have to emigrate, not to be forced to leave one’s home and one’s family and to cut off one’s roots, being able to find in one’s own land the conditions to achieve one’s own fulfilment.@@@Here too, we must have the courage to say it as it is.@@@Africa is not a poor continent.@@@To the contrary, it is rich with strategic resources.@@@It contains half the world’s minerals, including abundant rare earth minerals, and 60 per cent of arable lands, which are often not utilized.@@@Africa is not a poor continent, but it has often been, and still is, an exploited one.@@@Too often the interventions of foreign nations on the continent have not respected local realities.@@@The approach was often predatory, and yet still paternalistic.@@@We must change course.@@@Italy wants to contribute to the construction of a model of cooperation capable of collaborating with African nations so that they may grow and prosper from the great resources that they possess — a cooperation of equals, because Africa does not need charity, but to be put in a position to compete on an equal footing of strategic investments that can bind our futures together with mutually beneficial projects.@@@In that way we can offer a serious alternative to the phenomenon of mass migration, an alternative that is work, training, opportunities for nations of origin and pathways for legal and agreed migration, and thus integratable.@@@We will be the first to set a good example through the Mattei Plan for Africa, a development cooperation plan named after Enrico Mattei, a great Italian who knew how to balance Italy’s national interests with the rights of partner States to witness their own moment of development and progress.@@@The focal point is that we must have the courage to put humankind and human rights back at the centre of our action.@@@It seems like a self-evident principle, but that is now no longer the case.@@@Countries are invaded; wealth is increasingly concentrated; poverty is rampant; and the slave trade is re-emerging.@@@All of that seems poised to put the sacredness of the human being at risk.@@@Even what would seem, at a superficial glance, a tool that could improve the well-being of humankind, at a closer look can turn out to be a risk.@@@Let us just consider artificial intelligence.@@@The applications of that new technology may offer great opportunities in many fields, but we cannot pretend to not understand its enormous inherent risks.@@@I am not sure if we are adequately aware of the implications of technological development, whose pace is much faster than our capacity to manage its effects.@@@We were used to progress that aimed to optimize human capacities, while today we are dealing with progress that risks replacing human capacities, because, if, in the past, such replacement focused on physical tasks so that humans could dedicate themselves to intellectual and organizational work, today the human intellect risks being replaced, with consequences that could be devastating, particularly for the job market.@@@More and more people will no longer be necessary in a world ever-dominated by disparities and by the concentration of power and wealth in the hands of the few.@@@That is not the world that we want.@@@We should therefore not mistake that dominion for a free zone without rules.@@@We need global governance mechanisms that ensure that such technologies respect ethical boundaries and that technological development remains at the service of humankind, and not vice versa.@@@We must guarantee the practical application of the concept of “algorethics”, that is, ethics for algorithms.@@@Those are some of the major themes on which Italy will focus during its presidency of the Group of Seven in 2024.@@@However, they are mainly issues that are the responsibility of the United Nations.@@@They are enormous challenges that we will not be able to tackle if we do not also acknowledge our limitations as nations and as part of the multilateral system.@@@Italy therefore supports the need for a reform of the Security Council that will make it more representative, transparent and effective — a Council that can ensure a fairer geographical distribution of seats and that can also strengthen regional representation that comes from an order frozen in time, established by the outcomes of a conflict that ended 80 years ago in another century, in another millennium, so that everyone has the opportunity to demonstrate their worth at the present time.@@@On those and many other issues, we will be tested in our capacities to govern our times and in our ability to do what here in this Assembly Hall, on 2 October 1979, a great man, a saint and a statesman.@@@Pope John Paul II, recalled, that is, that political activity, whether national or international, comes from the human being, is practised by the human being and is meant for the human being.@@@I would like to congratulate the President of the General Assembly.@@@His Excellency Mr. Dennis Francis.@@@Ambassador of Trinidad and Tobago, as he takes over the helm of this organ at its seventy-eighth session.@@@Tuvalu has full confidence and trust in his leadership in steering our canoe through the rough seas ahead of us.@@@At this juncture.@@@I would also like to acknowledge the outgoing President.@@@His Excellency Mr. Csaba Korosi, for his stellar presidency, dedication and service to the Assembly throughout its seventy-seventh session.@@@In less than two weeks, my island nation of Tuvalu will be celebrating a momentous occasion, the forty-fifth anniversary of its independence.@@@That event has great significance in the history of our nation, symbolizing our journey through self-governance and sovereignty.@@@It is with a deep sense of gratitude that I express my people’s heartfelt appreciation to the United Nations and its Member States for their unwavering support in recognizing Tuvalu’s independence.@@@That recognition was further solidified 23 years ago, when Tuvalu officially became a Member State of the Organization in September 2000.@@@Tuvalu’s membership in the United Nations serves as more than just a symbolic gesture — it represents a beacon of hope for our country, assuring us of the international community’s commitment to safeguarding our sovereignty, even in the face of multifaceted challenges and existential threats.@@@The United Nations, with its noble values centred around peace, security and prosperity, radiates hope and assurance to small and vulnerable nations such as Tuvalu.@@@Our membership in it gives us confidence in our ability to navigate these uncertain times and reinforces our belief that we are not alone in our pursuit of a prosperous and secure future.@@@I would like to take a moment to express Tuvalu’s heartfelt condolences to all who have been affected by recent natural disasters.@@@Our hearts go out to the victims of the earthquake in Morocco and the flash flooding in Libya this month, as well as the wildfires in Hawaii in August.@@@We also want to express our sympathy to those who have suffered as a result of the conflicts in Africa and the war in Ukraine.@@@Turning now to this year’s theme.@@@Tuvalu wholeheartedly embraces the powerful narrative put forth by the President of the Assembly at its seventy-eighth session, as it aligns perfectly with our goal of creating a sustainable future for our nation and the world at large.@@@It is imperative that we demonstrate unwavering commitment to the principles set forth in the Charter of the United Nations and prioritize the wellbeing of our planet and all its inhabitants.@@@To fulfil that theme, we must first focus on rebuilding trust among nations and international institutions.@@@The erosion of trust has impeded global cooperation and stymied progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).@@@We must work to repair relationships, promote transparent and accountable governance and foster an environment of collaboration and mutual respect.@@@By doing that, we can restore faith in international institutions and cultivate partnerships that will enable us to effectively address the challenges of our time.@@@Similarly, reigniting global solidarity requires us to prioritize peace-building efforts.@@@Peace is a fundamental prerequisite for sustainable development, as conflicts and instability hinder progress towards the SDGs.@@@We must invest in conflict prevention, peacekeeping and post-conflict reconstruction to ensure that communities can thrive and work effectively towards achieving the Goals outlined in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@Accelerating action on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals requires collective effort and collaboration on a global scale.@@@We must recognize that we are all interconnected and that the prosperity and well-being of each individual nation ultimately impacts 
the entire planet.@@@Tuvalu therefore welcomes this year’s theme because it entails rebuilding trust, promoting global solidarity, prioritizing peace-building, fostering prosperity and advancing sustainability, which can help us make significant strides towards a more equitable, peaceful and sustainable future for all.@@@Let me now reflect on the important events of the high-level week that have been taking place alongside the general debate.@@@Tuvalu applauds the two-day SDG Summit, which served as an important platform for Member States to collectively assess the progress made towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and provides an opportunity to recognize and address the specific challenges that every country faces in pursuit of the Goals.@@@As a small island developing State.@@@Tuvalu faces unique and pressing issues in meeting the targets set forth in the SDGs.@@@The greatest challenge to the sustainable development that we are striving to achieve for our people is the fundamental threat of climate change and rising sea levels.@@@As a low-lying island State.@@@Tuvalu is particularly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change, such as extreme weather events, which affect our ability to achieve our SDG targets.@@@Despite those challenges.@@@Tuvalu remains fully committed to the SDGs and acknowledges the importance of forging strong partnerships, particularly through SDG 17.@@@Collaborative efforts with other Member States and international organizations and stakeholders are vital to mobilizing support and resources for addressing Tuvalu’s unique contextual challenges and achieving the shared objectives of sustainable development.@@@By focusing on those central issues and utilizing the SDGs as a guiding framework.@@@Tuvalu aims to build a resilient future while preserving its culture and environment and ensuring the welfare of its people.@@@We commend the Secretary-General for convening the Climate Ambition Summit, a pivotal moment for global climate action.@@@We are not calling for sympathy but rather for solutions.@@@In hindsight, climate justice should be at the forefront of our efforts as we address the urgent need for mitigation, adaptation and support for the most vulnerable nations.@@@We embrace the efforts and collective support for resolution 77/276, championed by Vanuatu, for an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice aimed at reinforcing States’ responsibility under international law to safeguard the climate system.@@@It is the hope of Tuvalu that international law will provide the moral punch to enable us to phase out fossil fuels and hold polluters responsible.@@@Furthermore, at this point I would like to mention that just last week, the Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda and I had the privilege of appearing before the judges of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea in Hamburg.@@@Our purpose was to present our arguments and submissions regarding an advisory opinion similar to that of Vanuatu but relating to the obligations of States parties under Part XII of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, specifically in terms of protecting and preserving the marine environment in relation to the impacts of climate change, including ocean warming, sea level rise and ocean acidification.@@@Tuvalu urges all Member States to support Vanuatu.@@@Antigua and Barbuda and Tuvalu by submitting endorsements of the advisory opinions’ objectives.@@@It is crucial for us to come together in pursuit of climate justice, as the urgency of the matter cannot be overstated.@@@We eagerly anticipate swift action from the judicial branches of the Organization because justice delayed is justice denied.@@@We applaud the Secretary-General for organizing the Summit of the Future, as it highlights the immense importance of ensuring a prosperous future for everyone.@@@The world is witnessing a rapid and transformative shift towards a digital era, and we believe that embracing that digital transformation is crucial to the progress of the global community, particularly small island developing States such as Tuvalu.@@@The vision for digital transformation under our Future Now project advocates the idea of creating a digital nation that maps and preserves Tuvalu’s identity and values for us and our future generations.@@@That digital revolution will ensure that no one is left behind, as it empowers individuals and communities with knowledge, connectivity and access to essential services.@@@For Tuvalu, the adoption of a digital nation approach will have a profound impact on our ability to address resource-related and geographic challenges.@@@It will enable Tuvaluans to access education, health care and economic opportunities that were previously out of reach.@@@By embracing digital technologies.@@@Tuvalu will equip itself with the tools to implement innovative solutions that address climate and environmental concerns.@@@Overall, the concept of a digital nation and the digital transformation that it entails are pivotal to harnessing progress, inclusivity and sustainability for Tuvalu and the entire world.@@@Despite our vision of a digital nation, it is crucial to acknowledge that our ultimate future as a recognized sovereign State depends on our ability to strengthen our 
resilience.@@@In pursuing that goal.@@@Tuvalu has developed a comprehensive long-term adaptation plan.@@@In serving as our flagship survival adaptation project, the Long-Term Adaptation Plan is aimed at addressing the imminent threat of rising sea levels by reclaiming and elevating our land territory.@@@That ambitious endeavour is crucial to ensuring that Tuvalu can provide a sustainable habitat for its population well into the next century and beyond.@@@By prioritizing the Plan.@@@Tuvalu is taking proactive steps to secure the nation’s survival and create a resilient future for its people.@@@I would now like to highlight our specific aspirations and initiatives.@@@As a country whose physical existence, lives and livelihoods are at stake.@@@Tuvalu cannot afford to take a back seat and be a spectator while others manoeuvre to satisfy their own interests in our multilateral process for addressing climate change, particularly sea level rise.@@@On the heels of our successful Rising National Initiative, which we launched this time last year, we have proposed establishing a coalition for addressing sea level rise and its existential threats.@@@The initiative is aimed at bringing together like-minded States and stakeholders to collectively address the pressing issue of protecting statehood, sovereignty, territorial integrity and livelihoods in the face of rising sea levels.@@@Tuvalu believes that the coalition has a unique role in highlighting and addressing the impact of climate change and sea level rise on vulnerable nations.@@@The aim is to attract greater attention and action from the international community by amplifying the voices of small island developing States and other nations facing similar challenges.@@@Tuvalu expresses gratitude to countries and stakeholders, in particular Germany, who have already shown interest in joining this important endeavour.@@@In addition to the coalition initiative.@@@Tuvalu calls for stronger global action on phasing out fossil fuel production and consumption.@@@At the Climate Ambition Summit on Wednesday this week.@@@Tuvalu made a call for countries to join it, alongside Vanuatu and other Pacific nations, to negotiate a fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty, a new instrument that would reduce reliance on fossil fuels, promote sustainable development through accelerating the just transition to renewable energy sources and curb greenhouse gas emissions.@@@Tuvalu, as an island State surrounded by the ocean, is fully committed to the signing and effective implementation of the Agreement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas beyond National Jurisdiction.@@@Our unison with others to sign the Agreement this week is a testament to our genuine commitment to the values and purpose of that international legal instrument.@@@Given our heavy reliance on fisheries and marine resources, by signing the Agreement.@@@Tuvalu pays tribute to the importance of preserving the health and diversity of the ocean ecosystems for both its own sustainability and the well-being of the global community.@@@The Preamble of the Charter of the United Nations begins with “We the peoples...”.@@@It is a powerful statement by this body to underscore respect for human dignity and human rights as equal peoples — men and women, boys and girls — of all races and colours.@@@It entails the inclusivity, non-discrimination and oneness of humankind that the United Nations must uphold.@@@Sadly, many people and communities have not been given the same treatment.@@@Tuvalu therefore calls on this body to ensure the participation of everyone worldwide, including the people of Taiwan.@@@We must make the necessary arrangements for Taiwan to meaningfully participate in relevant United Nations specialized agencies and mechanisms.@@@Taiwan must be allowed to participate in key United Nations organizations because Taiwan is widely known for being an able, trustworthy and willing partner, greatly contributing to collective efforts that address pressing global issues under the purview of the United Nations agencies.@@@It is unfortunate that the people of Cuba still endure the economic hardships imposed by long-standing unilateral economic blockades.@@@Those blockades not only disregard human rights but also go against the principles of cooperation emphasized in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@The decision to maintain those measures has deprived Cuba of much-needed international development assistance and partnerships crucial for its recovery and future development.@@@For Tuvalu, peace is not merely the absence of conflict, it is the presence of justice, equality and opportunity.@@@It is giving hope to our people by securing a prosperous future.@@@And prosperity, for us.@@@Tuvalu, is not just economic growth.@@@It is the ability to protect the well-being of our people and our planet through social and environmental sustainability.@@@To achieve those noble goals.@@@Tuvalu is unyielding in its commitment to dialogue that entails representation and coalitions.@@@We look at partnerships through this body for international cooperation that can establish 
tangible outcomes for the most vulnerable.@@@By pooling our resources, sharing knowledge and standing in solidarity, we can overcome obstacles and accelerate meaningful progress.@@@I would like to conclude by presenting a compelling challenge to this Organization.@@@It is not enough for us to simply acknowledge our unique role; we must also actively demonstrate our commitment to defending and promoting the core values and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.@@@It is of utmost importance that we remain unwavering in our dedication to collective action and inclusivity, embodying the Tuvalu cultural principles of kaitasi and falepili — the concepts of caring, sharing, being good neighbours and leaving no one behind — all for the sake of the sustainable and secure future we envision to have for our young generation and their children.@@@By embodying those noble concepts in our actions, we have the potential to create a brighter and more promising future for humankind and our planet.@@@Let us always bear in mind that the choices we make and the actions we take today will echo through countless generations to come.@@@Time is of the essence.@@@The clock is ticking.@@@The sun is setting.@@@It is now or never.@@@The theme of this year’s General Assembly asks us to accelerate action towards peace, prosperity, progress and sustainability for all.@@@I would argue that it is a laudable goal and one that now matters more than ever before.@@@But I must also ask if it is anywhere near enough.@@@I pose that question not because I wish to test the patience of the Assembly, but rather because even though collective multilateral solutions can and often do make a difference, it seems to me that too many of those solutions fall short of our ambitions.@@@Our words are never quite matched by our actions, and our achievements never quite meet our expectations.@@@It is as if the nations in the United Nations are not quite united enough.@@@Nowhere is that clearer to me than in two core areas — tackling climate change and managing migration, both of which will be at the heart of Greece’s Security Council candidacy for the 2025-2026 term.@@@If elected.@@@Greece will make climate and migration central tenets of its time on the Council, in addition to focusing on international law and maritime security.@@@That is because, at least in part, the global community’s current collective approach to climate and migration speaks to a failure to match its rhetoric to its delivery on policy.@@@Given the fact that we just experienced the hottest summer on record and that we talk rather than act when it comes to tackling the main drivers of irregular migration or even the implementation of the existing transnational agreements, we are in fact failing.@@@We must work harder collectively to change that.@@@Twelve months ago from this very rostrum.@@@I warned that without multilateral cooperation, the devastating effects of climate change would soon be the norm rather than the exception (see A/77/PV.10).@@@Twelve months later, that new norm has unfortunately already arrived.@@@This summer, floods, fires, heatwaves and landslides have gripped Southern Europe.@@@North Africa and the Mediterranean, bringing unprecedented destruction to the region, from Slovenia to Libya and from Italy to Greece.@@@Nowhere was that more apparent for Greeks than across Evros, in the north-east of my country, where the largest blaze ever recorded in the European Union (EU) burned continuously for almost two weeks.@@@In all.@@@20 people were killed, hundreds lost their homes and livelihoods and an area greater in size than New York City was razed to ashes.@@@Some 700 firefighters from across Europe fought valiantly to contain that devastating megafire, but they could not tame it.@@@As if that was not enough.@@@10 days later Greece was struck by Storm Daniel.@@@The region of Thessaly, in the centre of our country, saw twice as much rainfall in one day as falls in London in an entire year.@@@It was the worst storm to hit Greece in more than a century.@@@Daniel carved its destructive path not only through my country but Libya, too, landing on the coastal city of Derna, where the death toll now stands in the tens of thousands.@@@The impact of those events across the Mediterranean is unprecedented, with lives lost, businesses destroyed, communities upended, social cohesion undermined and the fragile ecology of our most precious natural habitats severely compromised.@@@Of course.@@@I accept that the climate crisis is not an alibi for everything, but the science is clear.@@@Unprecedented temperatures, fuelled by global warming, are creating the conditions that drive those catastrophic events.@@@This is no longer a crisis of the poorest or of the global South.@@@Our own very unequal battle with nature is now being fought out across Southern Europe and the Mediterranean in particular.@@@That is the new reality of climate change.@@@Greece and many of our friends and neighbours around the Mediterranean now face challenges similar to those of the countries that have preceded us at the sharp end of the climate crisis.@@@And like those countries, we need a much more coordinated response.@@@In Greece, we have pumped hundreds of millions into mitigation.@@@We introduced our first ever climate law, and we are driving ambitious proposals with a view to decarbonizing our islands.@@@We are partnering with multinationals in the pursuit of new green technology.@@@We are investing heavily in renewables, because given our natural assets of wind, sun and sea, the potential is huge.@@@Yet while we are acting decisively on long-term mitigation, we are collectively guilty of not placing enough emphasis on short-term adaptation, even though the task of becoming more resilient is about making changes today, not tomorrow.@@@After all, the crisis is already here.@@@It is affecting our lives today, and it is already having a significant impact on our economies.@@@For the European Union, that represents a failure of financial resourcing as well as of policy.@@@We are spending peanuts on adaptation and emergency relief.@@@We have two funds that are completely depleted, and that must change.@@@That is why, earlier this week.@@@I wrote to the leaders of Croatia.@@@Cyprus.@@@France.@@@Italy.@@@Malta.@@@Portugal.@@@Slovenia and Spain, which, along with Greece, make up the group of nine Mediterranean and southern European Union countries known as the EUMed 9.@@@In my letter I suggested two solutions to the short-term adaptation issue.@@@The first was that we should recognize that circumstances now demand that we act outside the EU’s long-term budget framework and State subsidy rules.@@@The second was that we should lead EU- wide efforts to define and implement a comprehensive, properly resourced strategic plan that addresses the new challenges we are now facing.@@@But this is not just about Europe.@@@After all, the problems facing Southern Europe and North Africa are no different from the issues faced by Canada this summer, or indeed by Pakistan last summer, when that country also suffered from catastrophic floods.@@@That is why I am calling for the creation of a global adaptation alliance — a forum through which we can deliver new collective thinking, renewed cooperation and access to new finance to drive short-term adaptation before it is too late.@@@It could enable us to invest more, for example, in sharing new technology for advanced forecasting and modelling, so that we can predict with greater clarity and accuracy how climate phenomena are going to behave.@@@It could inform us about where the floods are coming from and where the fires are going.@@@We will therefore push for the inclusion of an adaptation alliance at the upcoming twenty-eighth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in the United Arab Emirates.@@@Because only by working together can we make a real difference, not just by learning lessons from one another but by sharing best practices and solutions.@@@Take Greece’s early-warning emergency number.@@@112.@@@During the devastating wildfires in my country five years ago, it did not exist.@@@An entire seaside town was razed to the ground and more than 100 people perished.@@@We learned from that mistake — we put it right — and this summer the 112 number played a huge part in minimizing the loss of life.@@@What difference.@@@I wonder, would such an emergency number have made in Maui during the devastating Hawaiian fires — or in Libya, for example?@@@It is exactly those sorts of relatively cost-effective solutions that represent the type of technological adaptation that we need globally going forward, through simple yet life-saving ideas.@@@All of this is critical because at the end of the day our number one obligation is the protection of human life.@@@Let me turn to the second great challenge of our time, migration.@@@My country is at the forefront of the global migration crisis.@@@Greece has, over the past decade, provided shelter and protection to hundreds of thousands of refugees and asylum seekers.@@@Our coastguard has gone above and beyond to save tens of thousands of lives at sea.@@@Let me be clear: Greece will always be an open and welcoming country for those fleeing persecution and violence, as well as those economic migrants who however seek a new future by accessing legal pathways.@@@After all, our economy is growing again, we are attracting significant foreign investment, and there are many job opportunities in my country.@@@But we also need to fill those vacancies on our own terms, not those set by the criminal gangs.@@@That is why it is critical that the international community work together to establish a far more comprehensive and coordinated approach — one that addresses the root causes of migration, one that more effectively counters human trafficking and migrant smuggling and fosters legal pathways to mobility.@@@With regard to managing the root causes of migration, we must challenge the negative political, socioeconomic and climate trends at source, in the countries of origin, but also the countries of transit.@@@That means more tailor-made, innovative, multi-stakeholder partnerships to drive forward sustainable development and strengthen resilience, creating jobs and opportunities in the places of origin.@@@No one wants to leave their homes and risk their lives finding work thousands of miles away.@@@In real terms, that is about investing in infrastructure, in education, in health care and in the green and digital transition, all of which can reduce poverty, unemployment and inequality.@@@And it is about creating incentives for private-sector development.@@@It is about supporting entrepreneurship and small businesses, while always promoting good governance and women’s empowerment.@@@When it comes to migration.@@@Greece’s policy is tough but fair.@@@We are focused on preventing irregular migration and improving the effectiveness of return systems.@@@But we are also focused on facilitating safe, orderly and legal migration, while processing asylum claims expeditiously.@@@This issue is not going away.@@@Indeed, in recent weeks there is evidence across the Mediterranean that the pressure on our borders is, unfortunately, growing again.@@@That is why preventing departures must be the starting point.@@@We must break the business model of the traffickers and their networks if we are to stop people from embarking on such dangerous journeys.@@@Working together, bilaterally and multilaterally, we must strengthen border controls and surveillance mechanisms to detect and intercept smugglers and their activities.@@@And we can do that, through the use of advanced technology, intelligence-sharing and cooperation among border control agencies.@@@And we must enhance the capacity of law enforcement to investigate and prosecute those responsible for profiting from human despair, as well as disrupt the money networks through the strengthening of tools to identify and freeze traffickers’ assets.@@@We need a whole-of-route approach, raising public awareness of the dangers posed by the smuggling routes.@@@At the same time, as I said, we must provide legal pathways through family reunification, humanitarian visas but also labour mobility, something Greece has done with new bilateral agreements with countries such as Egypt and Bangladesh.@@@But above all, if we want to solve the problem in the Mediterranean, we must work together with our partner countries — Türkiye, of course, but also our North African neighbours.@@@Let me turn to Greece’s relations with its eastern neighbour.@@@Türkiye, but let me do so in the spirit of openness.@@@Rather than looking at the past.@@@I want today to look to the future.@@@Undoubtedly, long-standing geopolitical tensions between Greece and Türkiye remain.@@@Our two greatest shared challenges, however, climate change and migration, are of the present and of the future.@@@I told President Erdogan just that when we met yesterday.@@@Do not get me wrong — our main 
difference over the delimitation of our maritime zones in the Aegean and the eastern Mediterranean is and remains extremely important, but it can be resolved in accordance with international law, and in particular the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and in the spirit of good neighbourly relations.@@@We have made good progress over the past months in terms of normalizing our relationship, and it is in our mutual interest to continue down that path.@@@Turning to Cyprus, that remains, unfortunately, at its core, an issue of an illegal invasion and occupation, in violation of the fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations.@@@Our commitment to Cyprus’ sovereignty, territorial integrity and the solution of one State based on a bizonal, bicommunal federation is steadfast.@@@It is a matter of credibility and determination to defend the core values and principles upon which the United Nations is based.@@@Finding a fair, viable and mutually acceptable solution to the Cyprus issue remains a top priority for Greece.@@@And we will continue to fully support the United Nations-led efforts to facilitate the resumption of negotiations, always on the basis of the relevant Security Council resolutions.@@@I have addressed two of the three most important concerns we share today as a global community.@@@Let me end by quickly addressing the third.@@@Last year in this very Hall most of us condemned Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine — an act of blatant aggression that has shattered the inviolability of a sovereign border and has cost so many innocent lives.@@@Overall, the international community has stood firm against Putin’s provocation and disastrous attempt to rewrite history.@@@Today, however, the assertion on Russia’s part is that NATO, the EU and the other partners that support Ukraine will eventually lose the stomach to continue that fight.@@@Let me be clear: that should not happen and that will not happen.@@@We will never walk away from Ukraine, because to do so would be to abandon the very principles of peace, democracy and adherence to international law that so many in this Hall hold dear.@@@That message was sent out loud and clear by the leaders of the whole Balkans region, on 21 August, in Athens, at the regional summit we hosted together with President Zelenskyy.@@@In conclusion, whether the issue is addressing climate change, managing migration or fighting the threat to our democratic way of life, all the challenges we face are daunting.@@@We have said many times, failure is not an option.@@@True leadership will be required by all of us.@@@We cannot just sit idle and hope for a miracle.@@@I have the privilege of leading a mid-sized country that is trying to do its best to address issues of massive complexity, but it is time for the really big players to step up to the plate and deliver.@@@From this rostrum and in my capacity as representative of the President of the Republic of Cote d’Ivoire.@@@His Excellency Mr. Alassane Ouattara.@@@I would like to express, on his behalf as well as my own, warm and cordial greetings.@@@I would also like, on behalf of President Alassane Ouattara, to warmly congratulate the President of the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session, not only for his election but also for the effective conduct of his work.@@@I also wish to extend once again to the Secretary-General the gratitude of Cote d’Ivoire and the full support of the Ivorian Government for his various initiatives aimed at ensuring that the United Nations is, more than ever, a “centre for harmonizing the actions of nations”.@@@Our session is being held in a context of great uncertainty for our planet and for our States, which are faced with large-scale crises.@@@That situation significantly hinders the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and limits our ability to collectively address those challenges.@@@When it comes time to take stock, we must face the fact that the resources expected to finance that important Agenda are still not forthcoming, particularly for developing countries.@@@Faced with that observation, we must act quickly and demonstrate solidarity to ensure the sustainability and predictability of financing for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).@@@The noble ambition of the 2030 Agenda cannot remain dependent on security spending that increases year after year across the world.@@@That is why my delegation welcomes the relevant theme of the seventy-eighth session of the General Assembly, which invites us to make greater commitments and undertake greater efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@To do that, we must immediately reduce the cost of conflicts that undermine the development of our countries by prioritizing conflict prevention and mechanisms for their peaceful resolution.@@@At the same time, our Governments must strengthen the resilience of our economies so that they 
may contribute to financing the SDGs.@@@In that context.@@@Cote d’Ivoire welcomes with particular interest the Secretary-General’s proposal for a New Agenda for Peace, which asks us to rethink our priorities in terms of preserving and consolidating our collective security.@@@It is time for the international community to mobilize and act so that the parties to the conflict in Ukraine and all their external partners commit to a political settlement of that war.@@@Beyond the risk of escalating violence and human rights abuses, the conflict is fuelling global inflation, creating shortages of essential foodstuffs and threatening to plunge millions of people into famine.@@@In view of its scope and repercussions and the financial flows it is diverting, the war in Ukraine is dealing a death blow to funding for the SDGs and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@My country also calls on the international community to stand together with Africa in the fight against the armed terrorist groups that are destabilizing entire swathes of the continent, from the Sahel to the Horn of Africa.@@@Combating terrorism entails a high financial cost for African countries, particularly Cote d’Ivoire, which is also host to thousands of refugees from neighbouring countries in crisis.@@@The substantial financial resources dedicated to the latter will surely be in short supply for priority funding to achieve the SDGs.@@@Wherever they operate, armed terrorist groups are reversing decades of progress in the key sectors of education, health, culture and labour.@@@Moreover, they are depriving women and minorities of their fundamental rights and reject all notions of freedom and democracy.@@@In that regard, my country calls on the United Nations and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to explore ways of financing the priority counter-terrorism plan of action adopted by ECOWAS in 2019, the implementation of which has been slow.@@@For its part.@@@Cote d’Ivoire is ensuring the effective operation of the Jacqueville International Counter-Terrorism Academy, which was established in cooperation with and with the support of bilateral and multilateral partners and already enjoys an excellent reputation.@@@Climate change remains a major issue and is having a major impact on our economies and ability to overcome the challenge of financing for development.@@@Developing countries, such as Cote d’Ivoire, which are only marginally responsible for climate change, are disproportionately affected and are suffering the most from its consequences.@@@As an agricultural producer, my country is committed to strengthening efforts to combat the effects of climate change in order to improve people’s resilience, which involves, first, ramping up the sustainable management of natural resources and biodiversity, and secondly, encouraging people to develop civic awareness regarding environmental preservation and the promotion of sustainable development.@@@To that end, we urge partners that pledged their support at the fifteenth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, held in Abidjan in May 2022, to continue their support for the implementation of the Abidjan Initiative, also known as the Abidjan Legacy Programme.@@@That benchmark initiative, which is aimed at land restoration, biodiversity preservation and the development of responsible agriculture, represents an opportunity that we must take advantage of for the benefit of current and future generations.@@@Faced with the challenges of today, bilateral and multilateral partners must meet their financial commitments under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and also facilitate the entry into force of the loss and damage fund agreed at the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 27), held in Egypt.@@@Cote d’Ivoire welcomes the success of the African Climate Summit, held in Nairobi on 5 and 6 September 2023, and the outstanding work of the continent to ensure that its voice will be heard at COP 28, to be held in Dubai.@@@I take this opportunity to call on the international community to support the recommendations made in the Nairobi declaration on climate change, in particular with regard to increasing the continent’s renewable energy production capacity.@@@The proliferation and consequences of extreme weather events caused by climate change in recent years have resulted in widespread material destruction and the tragic loss of human life.@@@Such devastation — the cost of our inaction on climate change — is erasing the progress made towards achieving the SDGs, especially for the countries that are most vulnerable to the effects of global warming.@@@That demonstrates how much more solidarity and resources dedicated to financing the SDGs will be required to combat global warming and adapt our economies and societies.@@@The coronavirus pandemic revealed the precariousness of our health-care systems and, among other impacts, slowed the pace of economic growth on 
the African continent.@@@Above all, it served as a reminder of the importance of building genuine international solidarity to face the multifaceted threats to which humankind remains vulnerable.@@@The consequences of the pandemic continue to weigh down our economies and our ability to meet urgent social needs.@@@We must draw on all the lessons learned from a scourge that could once again threaten the entire world.@@@That is why my delegation welcomes the holding of the current session’s high-level meetings on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response; the fight against tuberculosis; and universal health coverage.@@@With regard to universal health coverage.@@@I would like to recall that my country has established a universal health coverage programme, which has been operational since October 2019.@@@I hope that the sharing of experiences at the current session will provide opportunities to strengthen our health-care systems.@@@Under the leadership of its President.@@@Cote d’Ivoire is consolidating its democratic progress, to which the recent municipal and regional elections and senatorial elections held on 2 and 16 September, respectively, attest.@@@The elections enjoyed the participation of all the country’s major political groupings and were held in a transparent and peaceful environment, thereby demonstrating the political maturity of the Ivorian people.@@@The stability, peace and democracy that reign in Cote d’Ivoire are allowing President Alassane Ouattara to pursue his project aimed at transforming and modernizing his country.@@@The outstanding progress made by Cote d’Ivoire in all sectors has fostered significant advances in the implementation of the SDGs.@@@The strength of the Ivorian economy has led to a significant drop in the poverty rate, which is currently at approximately 36.5 per cent, down from 56 per cent in 2011, and is set to fall further to 20 per cent by 2030.@@@At the same time, and since 2015, an ambitious productive social safety net project has enabled the provision of assistance to the households most in need.@@@Similarly, the Government has adopted an ambitious social support project, called PSGouv, to combat social vulnerability.@@@The Government’s policy and successive development national development plans have helped to improve progress towards the SDGs in Cote d’Ivoire.@@@However, social progress has been severely undermined by large refugee flows from neighbouring countries stricken by terrorism.@@@We have all reached the same conclusion.@@@Our States are far from being in a position to achieve the SDGs by 2030.@@@The financing of our development agenda reflects the urgent need for a multilateral approach to address the current global challenges.@@@That also forces us to consider the need for a reform of global governance at all levels and to restore the meaning of solidarity among nations — a principle dear to President Alassane Ouattara and which Secretary- General Antonio Guterres, in his opening statement for the current session, also encouraged us to embrace.@@@On behalf of the Government and the people of the Republic of Nauru, allow me to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Dennis Francis on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session.@@@It is always a pleasure to see another small island developing State taking up the leadership mantle.@@@Please let me assure the President of my delegation’s full cooperation and support as he leads this body in rebuilding trust and reigniting global solidarity.@@@Allow me to also thank His Excellency Mr. Csaba Korosi for his exceptional stewardship during the seventy-seventh session and note the many successful initiatives undertaken during his tenure, including continuing the President of the General Assembly Fellowship Programme, which promotes and supports youth engagement for the next generation of diplomats.@@@Allow me also to extend my sincere condolences to the Governments and people of Morocco and Libya for the recent devastating earthquakes and floods, as they seek relief and recovery during this time.@@@As the new President of Nauru, it is an honour to speak here at an institution built on the ideals of peace, justice, respect, human rights, tolerance and solidarity — an institution in which all countries are deemed equal.@@@As the smallest Member State of this body, those ideals have important resonance.@@@We are all part of an interconnected system that is increasingly growing smaller, and our dependence on each other to weather global challenges increases every day.@@@Will only the strong survive or will we work to ensure that no one is left behind?@@@Will we reform and ensure progress in this institution to reflect the realities of today or continue in the same dated fashion — a fashion that does not reflect our current, lived realities?@@@If we are to lift ourselves and future generations up and ensure that we are on a path to peace, prosperity, progress and sustainability for all, we all need to be dedicated to finding a way forward that reflects the world as it now stands — a world that is currently riddled with inequity.@@@A critical step in the way forward must be the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).@@@While the United Nations community was able to come together to adopt the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable 
Development in 2015 and celebrated this achievement of multilateralism at the time, we must admit that we are far from on track to achieve them — and by extension to achieve sustainable development for people and planet.@@@Given the resources that have been allocated at the regional and international levels to achieve the SDGs, that is deeply concerning.@@@In our view, such a failure to substantially move the needle in the light of the resources provided is an indication that funding is not being properly allocated or used.@@@In our region, there are too many workshops, too many studies upon studies, too many discussions without enough support for critical on-the-ground projects.@@@It is a small island for goodness’ sake.@@@It is like we are trying to launch a rocket to the sun.@@@Moreover, the realities of what is needed for implementation on the ground in a Pacific small island, with limited capacity and people, is rarely properly accounted for.@@@Issues around small things, which larger economies can discount — for example, access to basic materials — can become insurmountable when a country is trying to build a school or repair a road.@@@If we are serious about meeting the SDGs, we must ensure that needed resources make it to the right places.@@@That includes places like Nauru where, in the face of multiple global crises piled on top of national challenges, our ability to progress has been less than desirable.@@@In order to shift Nauru, and others, back on track to achieve the 2030 Agenda, we need to take bold steps and create and build partnerships that are built on mutual respect among equals.@@@To build such sustainable partnerships, we will need a more accurate and nuanced system of categorization of vulnerabilities.@@@Based on existing measurements for official development assistance — gross national income (GNI) and gross domestic product (GDP) — Nauru is eligible for neither grants nor loans.@@@However.@@@GNI and GDP alone do not sufficiently capture Nauru’s vulnerabilities, and we are therefore unable to access much-needed financing to enable the implementation of national development strategies and activities.@@@The multidimensional vulnerability index provides a practical solution to that issue and will ensure that Nauru is measured as it truly is — a struggling, small island developing State in great need of significant financial aid.@@@Nauru calls for the adoption of the multidimensional vulnerability index by Member States, including the establishment of an interim secretariat that will support its operationalization and implementation by all stakeholders, including as a criterion for access to low-cost and long-term financing based on this index.@@@Creating this more accurate picture of our national circumstances will be an important foundation upon which real and durable partnerships can be built.@@@And it goes without saying that any categorization for access to aid should be applied in an even-handed and non-politicized way.@@@We have been deeply disappointed to hear that, in some instances, the categorization of the Development Assistance Committee of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has been manipulated around purely political interests.@@@That cannot be allowed to happen, as it undermines the integrity of the entire system and is nothing shy of blatant manipulation.@@@Another pathway to accelerating action on the 2030 Agenda will be the recognition and incorporation of the special circumstances of small island developing States (SIDS) into our work at every level.@@@Such an opportunity will present itself when we meet for the SIDS conference in May of next year in Antigua and Barbuda.@@@If we are to make good on the promises for which the United Nations stands, the next SIDS conference must deliver the transformation needed to ensure that SIDS are more resilient to external shocks.@@@That can only be achieved through adopting a more focused, measurable and fully resourced programme of action that is tailored to the circumstances of SIDS and provides practical and operational solutions to accelerate our sustainable development.@@@The support of development partners and the international community, including funding, is critical for the next 10-year programme of action, as we seek to move towards resilient prosperity.@@@Even if these strides are taken towards the achievement of the 2030 Agenda, any progress made is at risk if we do not address the threat of climate change.@@@The adverse impacts are no longer a future problem.@@@We have seen ourselves the ever-increasing disasters: fires, typhoons, heat waves and a burning ocean.@@@What kind of legacy are we creating?@@@It is essential that the global community accelerates its efforts to adapt and mitigate climate change and keep a 1.5°C limit to temperature rise within reach.@@@That cannot be said enough, and so I will say it again: it is essential that the global community accelerates its efforts to adapt and mitigate climate change and keep a 1.5°C limit to temperature rise within reach.@@@We call on all States to take ambitious action in their implementation of the Paris Agreement and decisions under the Paris Agreement, including the Glasgow Climate Pact and the Sharm El-Sheikh Implementation Plan.@@@And we note our disappointment that the goal of $100 billion a year has not been reached and that the distribution of funds allocated has not been equitable.@@@And so, we join the call to reform the international financial system to make climate and development finance more affordable and adequate and positioned to combat the scale of climate crises.@@@Nauru looks forward to a meaningful twenty-eighth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in the United Arab Emirates, one that achieves the shared ambition and commitment to deliver progress and keep 1.5°C within reach.@@@We also continue to call on the Secretary-General to appoint a special representative on climate and security.@@@That could improve the ability of the United Nations to address climate-related security risks, including through regular reporting on the security implications of climate change.@@@Similarly, we see the need to seek additional paths to climate action and hope that the advisory opinions to come from the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea and the International Court of Justice will jump-start more ambitious climate action.@@@On that point.@@@Nauru would emphasize that we cannot expect the trajectory of global emissions to slow down and be reduced if viable energy alternatives are not provided.@@@Deep seabed minerals hold the answer, with polymetallic nodules providing the alternative for big emitters to make a just energy transition away from fossil fuels and towards much cleaner and renewable energy technologies.@@@In that regard.@@@Nauru calls on the members of the International Seabed Authority to fulfil their obligation and finalize the exploitation regulations that ensure that the collection of seafloor minerals are conducted with utmost responsibility and respect for our marine ecosystem while providing benefits for all humankind.@@@As a big ocean State, a healthy, productive and resilient ocean is a pillar upon which our future rests.@@@We are proud to have been actively engaged in the negotiations and successful conclusion of the Agreement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas beyond National Jurisdiction.@@@Nauru welcomes the adoption of the Agreement earlier this year and calls for international support to build our capacity to ratify and implement the provisions of the legally binding agreement on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction including the conservation of biological diversity, the sustainable use of its components and the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources.@@@Finally, as we have done before, we raise the critical importance of ensuring sustainable fisheries.@@@That includes ensuring that overfishing is not taking place, that fair prices are paid to small islands for fish taken from our water and that we eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.@@@Nauru’s long-term national vision, as articulated in its national sustainable development strategy, outlines a future in which individual, community, business and Government partnerships contribute to a sustainable quality of life for all Nauruans.@@@The central message of that strategy is partnership for quality of life.@@@A key pillar will be ensuring the health of our people.@@@To achieve that.@@@Nauru remains committed to a health strategy centred on prevention.@@@During the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).@@@Nauru followed a stringent “capture and contain” strategy, which required all visitors to Nauru to undergo testing and quarantine at the border.@@@That strategy protected Nauru during most of the pandemic, giving the health system valuable time to establish an acute-care ward to treat and isolate potential COVID-19 patients, streamline testing regimes and treatment protocols and vaccinate vulnerable members of the community.@@@The systems that were developed for COVID-19 are now available for future pandemic responses, should they be required.@@@We acknowledge and thank our partners for their support in that regard.@@@However.@@@Nauru remains vulnerable to communicable-disease outbreaks.@@@The pandemic proved the urgent need for extensive investment towards strengthening the institutional and infrastructure needs of Nauru’s fragile health system.@@@In a post-pandemic reality, we must ensure that rebuilding efforts are centred on building resilience.@@@We must remain vigilant in ensuring that our vaccination rates remain high and are not undermined by the spread of misinformation and fear-mongering through mainstream and social media.@@@Nauru needs support and technical expertise to develop innovative solutions, such as e-medicine and development and use of digital technologies for 
outpatient referrals and patient records, in order to address viral risks.@@@In that regard, we would like to thank our friends from Cuba.@@@There is still much to be learned from their innovation in the field of health.@@@Cuba developed their own COVID-19 vaccines.@@@Moreover, they help others by deploying their medical brigade worldwide.@@@As a staunch friend of Cuba, we call for an end to the embargo imposed by the United States.@@@We must also recognize and thank the Republic of China (Taiwan) for its help and support with regard to our health system.@@@They continue to be a leader in the application of good practices in containing and responding to disease.@@@We call for its recognition and its right to participate and engage with us all in this global forum on this issue and in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals, leaving no one behind.@@@Another crucial element for accelerating action on the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals towards peace, prosperity, progress and sustainability for all is education.@@@Nauru continues to prioritize and invest in strengthening and developing its education sector given its pivotal role as a key driver of sustainable development.@@@On a national scale.@@@Nauru aims to improve the quality and broaden the scope and reach of education.@@@In a post-pandemic reality, the immediate concern, globally and domestically, is to address the education gap.@@@Innovation and increased and improved investment are urgently needed in order to improve access to, and the quality of, education.@@@We are also prioritizing quality infrastructure, tailored to the unique needs of Nauru.@@@That will need to be matched with relevant curricula and effective monitoring and evaluation frameworks, such as benchmarking.@@@None of that can happen without our teachers.@@@Teacher attraction and retention continue to be an issue —not just in Nauru, but worldwide.@@@The demands of, and lack of support for, the teaching profession is being manifested in a lack of qualified teachers on our island.@@@We need to do more and better on that front, including by reviewing education-delivery models through increased involvement of homes and the development of inexpensive, alternate models of delivery via communication technologies and through improved information and communication technologies infrastructure in schools in order to enhance programme delivery.@@@We must uphold the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and we must work together to uphold the rules-based multilateral system in order to secure international peace, security and prosperity for a safe and just world for all, leaving no country behind.@@@For that to happen, the United Nations must be, nimble on the ground and must meet the global challenges we face today.@@@I would like to share what time has taught me.@@@Our community — Nauru, the Pacific, the small islands, the international community — is more robust when we stand united.@@@That becomes even more imperative for matters of common interest that have the potential to benefit our peoples in future generations.@@@But we must stand united for the right things, the important things and the hard things.@@@In a nutshell.@@@I echo the opening remarks of Secretary-General Guterres, we need to renew the United Nations multilateral system, reform the Security Council and redesign the international financial architecture because it is simply not working anymore and is an outdated system that has been in place for too long.@@@In Nauru’s case, like that of other small island developing States, we become victims within the global architecture and compromise our freedom and voice as a sovereign State.@@@May God bless the Republic of Nauru, and may God bless the United Nations.@@@I stand before the Assembly as the representative of a free and independent country, the Republic of Serbia, which is on its European Union (EU) accession path, but which at the same time is not ready to turn its back on traditional friendships it has been building for centuries.@@@I want to raise my voice on behalf of my country, but also on behalf of those who today.@@@78 years after the establishment of the United Nations, truly and equally believe that the principles of the Charter of the United Nations are the only substantial defence of world peace, the right to freedom and the independence of nations and countries; but more than that, they are a pledge of the very survival of the human civilization.@@@The new global wave of wars and violence that are impacting the foundations of international security is a painful consequence whose cause lies in abandoning the principles envisaged in the United Nations Charter.@@@All of us, speaking in this renowned Organization, speak about our own problems, confronting often a real and imaginary enemy, patronizing our own public, or telling fairy tales of the future with an insufficiently realistic view of the issues.@@@What does the future of the world look like?@@@Even though all of us listened to the words of the Secretary-General, not many actually heard and almost not a single world news outlet conveyed his words of warning.@@@Nevertheless, in an era of social network dominance, when the only important thing is to get one more “like”; in an era when a pet 
gets more attention than a child, it is no wonder that we cannot recognize the dangers that are in front of us.@@@As the President of one not-so-big country.@@@I cannot and have no right to speak about relations between great Powers.@@@It is neither my job, nor could I do so, but I can — and I will — speak about how inobservance of international public law can bring horrible consequences.@@@The attempt to cut my country into pieces, which formally started in 2008 with the unilateral declaration of independence of so-called Kosovo, has not ended yet.@@@It was precisely the violation of the United Nations Charter in the case of Serbia that was one of the visible precursors of the numerous problems we are all facing today, which go far beyond the borders of my country and the region I come from.@@@Broadly observed, since we last met in this Hall the world is neither a better nor a safer place — quite the opposite.@@@Global peace and stability remain under acute threat.@@@We continue to face problems related to energy security, financial instability, and security and disruptions in the food and medication supply chains.@@@Not only have we not found solutions to many problems, but they have become more numerous, and some have even grown more complex.@@@I have also spoken about how nobody here listens to anyone and or strives for real agreements.@@@In the meantime, we have started to talk even less and less.@@@It is as if virtually all, guided solely by their own interests and entrenched in their positions, have given up on seeking compromise solutions.@@@While for three days in a row we pledge from this place to respect of principles and rules of the United Nations Charter, their violation is rooted precisely in most of the problems in international relations, and the implementation of dual standards is an open invitation to all those who strive to achieve their interests through war and violence, by violating not only the norms of international law but also basic human morality.@@@All the speakers so far — and.@@@I believe, all who will speak after me — have spoken of the necessity of changes in the world, underlining their own countries as exemplars of morality and commitment to the law and world justice.@@@Today I will not utter many superlatives about my country; about the growth of salaries and pensions or about hundreds of kilometres of constructed highways and railroads, newly built hospitals and schools, science-technology parks or the artificial intelligence institute, because it is a natural thing that I protect its interests and that I love it more than anything in the world.@@@But I will speak about the principles that have been violated and that have brought us to the situation in which we are today.@@@Those principles were violated not by the small States, which are often the targets of attack, but by the most powerful countries in the world, especially those that give themselves the right to lecture, each from its own angle, on politics and morals to the whole world.@@@Here in this Hall only two days ago (see A/78/ PV.4), we heard the President of the United States speak of the most important principle in relations between countries: respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty.@@@It was only as the third most important factor that he mentioned human rights.@@@It seemed to me that everybody in this Hall could support that.@@@I, as the President of Serbia, supported it with unhidden jubilance.@@@The only problem in all that was the fact that, a few hours after his speech.@@@I had to see on these premises the President of so-called Kosovo, who is considered by the most powerful part of the West to be the President of an independent country — originating, by the way, through its secession from the territory of the Republic of Serbia.@@@At the same time, only a few metres away from this Hall, the German Minister said that Germany firmly observed the Charter of the United Nations and United Nations decisions and documents, and that it would never give up on that.@@@All that would be nice if it were true.@@@Specifically, almost all Western Powers brutally violated both the United Nations Charter and Security Council resolution 1244 (1999), which was adopted in this renowned Organization, just as they denied and violated those very principles that they are defending today.@@@This happened, first.@@@24 years ago and then exactly 15 years ago.@@@For the first time, unprecedented in world history, the most powerful 19 countries made the decision, without the involvement of the Security Council — I repeat, without any decision by the Security Council — to brutally attack and punish a sovereign country on European soil, as they said, to prevent a humanitarian disaster.@@@They did not laugh out loud when the Russian President used the very same words to justify his attack against Ukraine.@@@They forgot that they themselves had used the same narrative, the same words and the same explanations.@@@I would therefore like to inform members of the Assembly that Serbia has not set foot 
in the territory of any other country or threatened its existence; but 24 years ago, the most powerful and the strongest 19 showed no mercy to small Serbia.@@@Even when they had finished that job, they said that the issue of Kosovo was a democratic issue and that it would be resolved in accordance with the United Nations Charter and other documents of international law.@@@And then, contrary to absolutely all documents of international public law, it occurred to them in 2008 to support the independence of so-called Kosovo.@@@The illegal decision on the secession of the Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija from Serbia was made a decade after the armed conflict in our country had ended.@@@Without a referendum or any other democratic form of declaring their stance to the citizens of Serbia or at least to those in Kosovo and Metohija itself, that decision was made at a moment when Serbia had a Government committed to European and Euro-Atlantic integration and when it included in its composition the province of Kosovo and Metohija.@@@Serbia was then a full-fledged Member not only of the United Nations, but also of the Council of Europe, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and many other international organizations.@@@Nevertheless, that did not prevent legal and political violence from being wielded by those who are today at the forefront in lecturing from this rostrum.@@@Pointless and meaningless explanations — such as the police terror that Serbian authorities had carried out in its southern province a decade earlier, the humanitarian crisis or the expulsion of the local Albanian population — were only the drop that overspilled the glass of lies and nonsense in order to justify the violence against a sovereign country and undermine its integrity.@@@Since the moment of victory of those 19 against small Serbia.@@@70 per cent of Serbs from Kosovo and Metohija have left their homes, and there are now 300.000 Albanians more than there had ever been in Kosovo.@@@Well, so much for the law; so much for justice.@@@Nevertheless, worse than anything else is the fact that all those who committed aggression against the Republic of Serbia lecture today about the territorial integrity of Ukraine, as if we did not support the integrity of Ukraine.@@@We do support it and we will keep supporting it, because we do not change our politics and principles, regardless of our centuries-long traditional friendship with the Russian Federation.@@@To us, every violence is the same; every violation of the United Nations Charter is the same, regardless of the strength of the Power that exerts it or the inevitably similar excuses it makes for its illegal and immoral behaviour.@@@But when we ask them about the territorial integrity of the Republic of Serbia and about what they did to my country, the answer is the one that all of representatives of small countries in the world have heard on countless of occasions: “Do not go back to the past; look towards the future because it is the only way for your country to make progress.”@@@When it comes to the territorial integrity of Ukraine.@@@Serbia and any other country, all of us are entitled to speak about it from this rostrum, at least a bit more than they are.@@@I am the President of Serbia in my second presidential term.@@@On countless occasions I have been under various kinds of political pressure.@@@I am a political veteran, and what I will say today is most important to me.@@@Principles do not change from one circumstance to another.@@@Principles do not apply only to the strong; they apply to all.@@@If that is not the case, they are no longer principles.@@@And that is why I believe that in the modern world there will either be principles and the same rules will apply to all, or, as the world, we will end up in the deepest divisions in our history, in the most difficult conflicts and in problems we will not manage to cope with.@@@Another important thing is that peace has become a forbidden word because all of them have their favourites and their culprits.@@@The only values that remain to the great Powers are precisely their principles, but false ones.@@@As long as they are fine with them, they will call upon them.@@@The first time — as was the case with Serbia — they disagreed with the principles, the aw and the rules, the law, justice and the principles suffered.@@@Today in Kosovo and Metohija, a southern province of the Republic of Serbia, overt violence is taking place, directed against Serbs by the separatist authorities of Albin Kurti.@@@Only last week, after who knows which failed round of dialogue in Brussels, the Prime Minister in Pristina.@@@Mr. Albin Kurti, after rejecting the European proposal for de-escalation, addressed the public in front of one of the main buildings of the European Union and, before millions of viewers of the media that were present, conveyed to the not so many remaining Serbs in Kosovo that the Serbs will “suffer and pay for the mistake they made”.@@@Is there anything worse than mocking humanity, the international rules- based order and the international community than these words?@@@Unfortunately, that is possible.@@@Only one day later, as we sit in this Hall, a new contingency of Serbs is being taken to Kurti’s prisons, apprehended pursuant to fabricated accusations, as a part of his terror campaign.@@@Even worse are the actions continuously undertaken by Kurti’s extremist regime in the past 20 months and which, in practice, together with the repeated, accelerated displacement of the remaining Serbs, are turning into a crawling ethnic cleansing in the heart of Europe.@@@Members can conclude for themselves just how deep the Kurti’s regime’s cynicism goes from the following.@@@Since the European Union and United States State Secretary Antony Blinken issued a statement in early June, condemning the unilateral action of the so-called Government of Kosovo, ethnically motivated attacks against Serbs in our southern province have risen by 50 per cent, while during the same period the Pristina authorities have made 22 new escalatory moves.@@@The Serbian boys Stefan Stojanovic and Milos Stojanovic, who are 11 and 21-years-old, respectively, were wounded on Christmas Eve by members of the so-called Kosovo security forces (KSF), in whose equipping some of the attendees in this Hall take part, knowing quite well that it is deeply illegal and that the mere existence of the KSF is contrary to Security Council resolution 1244 (1999).@@@Seven innocent civilians have been shot by the representatives of the so-called Kosovo institutions.@@@The disruption of the delivery of supplies to hospitals, election voting bans for Serbs alone, a comprehensive economic blockade of Serbian goods, and attacks against churches, graveyards and schools are a part of the sad daily life of my people in that part of our territory, parted by the violent secession contrary to the United Nations Charter.@@@And hard as it is to believe, even though there has not been a single Albanian wounded, not a single suspect apprehended or a single injured Albanian, it is always somehow the fault of both sides.@@@Unlike in 1999, when Belgrade and other cities in my country were bombed, leaving a bloody trail from several thousand dead civilians and soldiers in scenes that pretty much resemble those that we, unfortunately, are seeing today in different parts of the world when an obvious act of terror — which they themselves say recalls what happened to Albanians — happens against Serbs, there is no humanitarian disaster; there is no call for action.@@@There is nothing.@@@They are only worried now and shrug their shoulders, but if they have to make any decisions, it will always be, as they put it, the fault of both sides.@@@In such a world.@@@I believe that one small Serbia, by raising its voice and fighting for universal values and the principles of the inviolability of internationally recognized borders, territorial integrity, sovereignty and political independence, sets an example of a fight for the right that was abolished here in this building, and protects the principles the world should be made of, with its not very great strength but with its paramount decisiveness and courage.@@@We did not change those principles for the purpose of daily politics and our own needs.@@@And just as we preserve the integrity of Serbia, we defend the integrity of each United Nations Member State.@@@It is only a bit sad that all the big ones, which are not interested in the law and justice, call in different circumstances upon whatever principles they find the most suitable at that particular moment.@@@When one follows such politics, when there is no morality in world politics, then it is clear that we are about to enter an era of big divisions and big conflicts — not only political and economic, but military ones as well.@@@And in this very difficult situation, the United Nations is the last substantial platform that brings us all together, regardless of all our differences and divisions.@@@I believe that the commitment to peace and development and the desire to resolve disputes through dialogue, to find common ways to end human suffering and to ensure a more prosperous and stable future are precisely what unites us.@@@That is why we extend our full support to all important reform processes of the United Nations itself, including the initiatives of the Secretary-General.@@@For the preservation of global peace and so that we all do not disappear in a Darwinist conflict led by great Powers, it is necessary to join forces, just like we did 78 years ago, in a common fight for an international order based on the United Nations Charter.@@@Respecting the United Nations Charter is not a choice; it is an obligation.@@@After all, as I have already said while mentioning some names, this is what we had the opportunity to hear during statements made by most colleagues while talking, among other issues, about the topic that is still dominant in all forums — the conflict in Ukraine.@@@I agree with them when it comes to the necessity of respecting the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine, which the Republic of Serbia has consistently done from the beginning.@@@We have been making such appeals continuously for decades, but with a significant difference.@@@Serbia supports the territorial integrity and sovereignty of all United Nations Member States — I repeat, all Member States.@@@Therefore, it is hard for me to understand how some are still not acting in a consistent manner when it comes to the need to respect the territorial integrity of Serbia and how they fail to understand that the selective application of principles leads to pronounced divisions, a lack of solidarity and mutual understanding.@@@However.@@@I want to wholeheartedly thank the global majority.@@@Significantly more than one half of United Nations Member States support the United Nations Charter in our case, and they do not support the violent partition of my country.@@@I am glad that, for the majority of United Nations Member States, double standards are out of the question.@@@We are deeply grateful to all who selflessly support our efforts to preserve our territorial integrity, thereby demonstrating their commitment to the United Nations Charter.@@@By safekeeping their borders today, they safe-keep their borders and they preserve peace.@@@On their behalf, as well as on our behalf, we will continue, year after year, to underline that defending principles is the same as defending freedom, independence and peace.@@@It often seems to us that the discussion with Pristina’s Government is more like a monologue than a dialogue because it is hard to explain why, more than 10 years after the signing of the Brussels Agreement and the ensuing obligations, the community of Serb majority municipalities has not been formed.@@@The Republic of Serbia, its Government and all its institutions are working in their full capacity on the preservation of dialogue with the Pristina, under EU auspices.@@@It is our task.@@@Dialogue is possible only when all of us, including the European facilitators, adhere firmly to what has been agreed.@@@The imbalance by which Serbia has to make concessions all the time is not leading towards a solution — quite the contrary.@@@As I said at the beginning of my speech.@@@Serbia is on its European path, ready to change, to reform itself and to make progress.@@@Today Serbia has very good cooperation with the United States of America in almost all areas, and we believe that our relations will only be better in the future.@@@At the same time.@@@Serbia will cherish its big and traditional friendships on all continents, while being proud of its good relations with all the nations and countries of Africa.@@@Asia and Latin America.@@@We do not divide people by the colour of their skin or their religious affiliation; that is why our relations with the People’s Republic of China, many Arab and other Muslim countries are at the highest historical level.@@@Nor have we cut our important and historical ties with the Russian Federation.@@@Believing that dialogue is the only way to find a compromise solution.@@@Serbia remains committed to that process in the aim of ensuring peaceful coexistence for Serbs and Albanians.@@@The peace and stability of the region have no alternative.@@@It is in that belief that we approach all discussions facilitated by the EU.@@@As many here may know, different interpretations of history are the cause of many disagreements and open issues, and not only in our region.@@@I believe in the future, and I believe that, by making joint efforts, we still have the capacity and ability to try to overcome our differences and focus on what connects us — our care for the well-being of our nations.@@@We want to build bridges, not walls.@@@We need to look towards the future.@@@We need to move forward and to use every chance for economic growth, connectivity and the exchange of ideas.@@@Today we have common toll collection from Belgrade almost to the Adriatic Sea, and soon we will have it to the Aegean Sea.@@@We have opened the borders in the Balkans; we have opened the labour market and enabled the free flow of people, goods and capital.@@@That was the very guiding star and initiator of the Open Balkan initiative, which has yielded concrete results so far and strengthened regional ownership of the processes of the economic connectivity of the region.@@@The Open Balkan initiative has also improved the political atmosphere.@@@We take such an approach to all our neighbours and our key interest is to preserve stability in the region and turn towards as intensive cooperation as possible in all areas.@@@Those processes are certainly an inseparable part of our strivings to become a full-fledged member of the European Union, which is at the same time one of the key priorities of our foreign policy.@@@This priority certainly does not exclude our commitment to cooperation development and the deepening of relations with our traditional friends in all parts of the world, and in particular in our region, where we remain a reliable and responsible partner.@@@We will strive to strengthen existing and build new friendships, both bilaterally and through participation in the initiatives and forums of different regions all over the world.@@@The latest confirmation that geographic distance should not be a barrier to cooperation is the recent accession of the Republic of Serbia to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia.@@@Additionally, we are proud of having been given a unique opportunity to make the spirit of friendship I speak of felt in Belgrade, which will host the specialized exhibition Expo 2027.@@@We are grateful to all those who have supported us and had faith in us.@@@After lengthy negotiations with a great deal of optimism, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, a plan of action for people, planet and prosperity, was adopted in this Hall in resolution 70/1, by which we pledged that no one would be left behind.@@@Halfway to the deadline for meeting the goals of the Agenda, there is still a glimmer of hope that we will be able to fulfil the promise we gave, although there are many reasons for concern.@@@Despite the progress that has been made in certain areas, unfortunately we are still facing basic existential problems such as poverty, hunger and inequality.@@@Serbia puts maximum effort into securing a stable and safe future, at the same time initiating policies based on the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@Among some of the results so far are the following: the development of instruments for integrating the principle of leaving no one behind into our legislative and strategic documents, as well as our participation in global initiatives and their implementation at the national level in the areas of sustainable food systems, the transformation of education systems and urban development.@@@We have lived to see the fourth industrial revolution and new technologies as a development opportunity that we must not squander.@@@That is why we continue investing in infrastructure, economic reforms and the creation of better business environment.@@@Digitization and education are among our key priorities.@@@The need to find new sources of growth has also been recognized.@@@That is why our future activities will be focused on innovation, research and development and creative industries.@@@Serbia is the first country in the South-East Europe region that joined the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence and adopted a development strategy in that area back in 2019.@@@The BIO4 campus is being built; it is a unique, multidisciplinary complex for research and development in the natural sciences, which should become one of the key bioeconomic hubs in Europe.@@@We firmly believe that knowledge and science play one of the key roles in accelerating activities towards the implementation of the 2030 Agenda.@@@Therefore.@@@I am proud that, at the proposal of the Republic of Serbia and like-minded countries, the General Assembly adopted resolution 77/326, declaring the period from 2024 to 2033 the International Decade of Sciences for Sustainable Development.@@@We do all this for future generations.@@@I believe that the involvement of young people in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda is an important prerequisite for its success because, beyond any doubt, the young are the most important development engine of every society.@@@I believe that we are all aware that there is no development without peace.@@@As Nelson Mandela said.@@@“Peace is the greatest weapon for development that any person can have”.@@@We must believe in that and work together on it.@@@The conditio sine qua non is, first and foremost, conversation — to listen and to try to hear and understand each other.@@@There is no alternative to peace.@@@Finally.@@@I want to take this opportunity to invite the representatives of all United Nations Member States to take part in the world exhibition Expo 2027.@@@Belgrade.@@@Serbia’s capital, a cosmopolitan metropolis with 2 million inhabitants, is home, and we extend a welcoming hand for participation in the freest and most diverse international exhibition so far.@@@We invite everyone to Belgrade to celebrate humanity together.@@@I know that I have spoken much longer than I was asked to do, but I have to say that I have given myself the same right to do so as the big Powers have given themselves.@@@I welcome all who stand for common efforts.@@@I promise that, by being truly united, we can guarantee fair peace for all nations.@@@What is more, unity can prevent wars.@@@This Hall saw many wars but not as an active defender against aggressions.@@@In many cases, the fear of war, the final war, was the loudest here — the war after which no one would gather in the General Assembly Hall again.@@@The third World War was seen as a nuclear war — a conflict between States on the highway to nukes.@@@Other wars seemed less scary compared to the threat of the so-called great Powers firing their nuclear stockpiles.@@@The twentieth century therefore taught the world to restrain from the use of weapons of mass destruction — not to deploy, not to proliferate, not to threaten with and not to test, but to promote complete nuclear disarmament.@@@Frankly, that is a good strategy.@@@But it should not be the only strategy to protect the world from a final war.@@@Ukraine gave up its third-largest nuclear arsenal.@@@The world then decided that Russia should become a keeper of such power.@@@Yet history shows that it was Russia that deserved nuclear disarmament the most, back in the 1990s; and Russia deserves it now.@@@Terrorists have no right to hold nuclear weapons.@@@No right.@@@But nukes are truly not the scariest now.@@@While nukes remain in place, mass destruction is gaining momentum.@@@The aggressor is weaponizing many other things, and those things are used not only against our country, but also against those of all present.@@@There are many conventions that restrict weapons but there are no real restrictions on weaponization.@@@First, let me give an example — food.@@@Since the start of the full-scale war, the Ukrainian ports in the Black and Azov Seas have been blocked by Russia.@@@Until now, our ports on the Danube River remain the target for missiles and drones.@@@Russia’s attempt to weaponize the food shortage on the global market in exchange for the recognition for some, if not all, of the captured territories is clear.@@@Russia is launching food prices as weapons.@@@The impact spans from the Atlantic coast of Africa to South-East Asia.@@@That is the threat scale.@@@I would like to thank the leaders who supported our Black Sea Grain Initiative and the Grain From Ukraine programme.@@@United, we made turned weapons back into food.@@@More than 45 nations saw how important it was to make Ukrainian food products available on the market, from Algeria and Spain to Indonesia and China.@@@Even now, when Russia has undermined the Black Sea Grain Initiative, we are working to ensure food stability.@@@I hope that many Member States will join us in those efforts.@@@We launched a temporary sea-export corridor from our ports, and we are working hard to preserve the land routes for grain exports.@@@It is alarming to see how some of our friends in Europe play out solidarity in a political theatre, making a thriller out of the grain.@@@They may seem to play their own role, but they are in fact helping to set the stage for a Moscow actor.@@@Second is the weaponization of energy.@@@Many times, the world has witnessed Russia using energy as a weapon.@@@The Kremlin weaponized oil and gas to weaken the leaders of other countries when they came to Red Square.@@@Now the threat is even greater.@@@Russia is weaponizing nuclear energy.@@@Not only is it spreading its unreliable nuclear-power-plant construction technologies, but it is also turning other countries’ power plants into real dirty bombs.@@@Look what Russia did to our Zaporizhzhya power plant.@@@It shelled it and occupied it, and it now blackmails others with radiation leaks.@@@Is there any sense in reducing nuclear weapons when Russia is weaponizing nuclear power plants?@@@That is a scary question.@@@The global security architecture offers no response or protection against such a treacherous radiation threat, and there is no accountability for radiation blackmailers so far.@@@The third example is children.@@@Unfortunately, various terrorist groups abduct children to put pressure on their families and societies.@@@But never before have mass kidnapping and deportation been a part of Government policy — not until now.@@@We know the names of tens of thousands of children, and have evidence regarding hundreds of thousands of others, kidnapped by Russia in the occupied territories of Ukraine and later deported.@@@The International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Putin for that crime.@@@We are trying to get children back home, but time goes by.@@@What will happen to them?@@@Those children in Russia are taught to hate Ukraine, and all ties with their families are broken.@@@That is clearly genocide.@@@When hatred is weaponized against one nation, it never stops there.@@@Each decade.@@@Russia starts a new war.@@@Parts of Moldova and Georgia remain occupied.@@@Russia turned Syria into ruins, and if it were not for Russia, chemical weapons would have never been used there.@@@Russia has almost swallowed Belarus.@@@It is clearly threatening Kazakhstan and the Baltic States.@@@The goal of the current war against Ukraine is to turn our land, our people, our lives and our resources into a weapon against those present and against the international rules- based order.@@@Many seats in the General Assembly Hall may become empty if Russia succeeds in its treachery and aggression.@@@The aggressor disseminates death and brings ruin, even without nukes, but the outcomes are similar.@@@We see towns and villages in Ukraine wiped out by Russian artillery, completely levelled to the ground.@@@We see a war of drones.@@@We know the possible effects of spreading the war into cyberspace.@@@Artificial intelligence could be trained to fight well before it would learn to help humankind.@@@Thank God, people have not yet learned to use climate as a weapon.@@@While humankind fails in the objectives of its climate policy, it means that extreme weather will still have an impact on normal global life, and some evil State will also weaponize its outcomes.@@@When people in the streets of New York and other cities of the world went out on climate protests, we all saw them.@@@When people in Morocco.@@@Libya and other countries die as a result of natural disasters, when islands and countries disappear under water and when tornadoes and deserts spread into new areas, while all that was happening, one unnatural disaster in Moscow 
decided to launch a big war and kill tens of thousands of people.@@@We have to stop it.@@@United, we must act to defeat the aggressor and focus all our capabilities and energy on addressing those challenges.@@@Just as nuclear weapons are limited, the aggressor and all its tools and methods of war must likewise be restrained.@@@Every war can now become the final one, but it takes our unity to make sure that aggression will not intrude again.@@@It is not a dialogue between the so-called great Powers somewhere behind closed doors, but the open work of all nations for peace that can guarantee us all a new era of no wars.@@@Last year (see A/77/PV.7, annex I).@@@I presented the outlines of the Ukrainian peace formula at the General Assembly.@@@Later, in Indonesia.@@@I presented the full formula.@@@Over the past year, the peace formula has become the basis for updating the existing security architecture.@@@We can now bring the Charter of the United Nations back to life and guarantee the full power of the rules-based world order.@@@Tomorrow I will present the details at a special meeting of the Security Council.@@@The main thing is that it is not only about Ukraine.@@@More than 140 States and international organizations have supported the Ukrainian peace formula, fully or in part.@@@The Ukrainian peace formula is becoming global.@@@Its points offer solutions and steps that will stop all the forms of weaponization that Russia used against Ukraine and other countries and that may be used by other aggressors.@@@Look, for the first time in modern history, we have a real chance to end the aggression on the terms of the nation that was attacked.@@@It is a real chance for every nation to ensure that aggression against their State, if it happens.@@@God forbid, will end not because their land will be divided and they will be forced to submit to military or political pressure, but because their territory and sovereignty will be fully restored.@@@We launched the format of meetings among national security advisers and diplomatic representatives.@@@Important talks and consultations were held in Hiroshima.@@@Copenhagen and Jeddah on the implementation of the peace formula, and we are preparing a global peace summit.@@@I invite all participants who do not tolerate any aggression to jointly prepare the summit.@@@I am aware of the attempts to make some shady dealings behind the scenes.@@@Evil cannot be trusted.@@@Ask Prigozhin if one can bet on Putin’s promises.@@@I ask that Member States hear me.@@@Let unity decide everything openly.@@@While Russia is pushing the world to a final war.@@@Ukraine is doing everything to ensure that, after the Russian aggression, no one in the world will dare to attack any nation.@@@Weaponization must be restrained; war crimes must be punished; deported people must come back home; and the occupier must return to its own land.@@@We must be united to make that happen, and we will do it.@@@Slava Ukraini.@@@I am deeply honoured to address the Assembly.@@@I believe that our commitment will lead us to the answers of the pressing challenges that humankind is facing today.@@@Today we live in a world of increasing risks and uncertainty.@@@The resurrected ghost of self-destruction, as a result of the full-scale war in Europe, is a nightmare that my generation wrongly believed to be a bygone phase in human history.@@@War, conflicts and terror challenge the future of our civilization.@@@So do the higher level of socioeconomic distress, the growing food insecurity, the disruption of supply chains and the rise of inflation rates which started during the coronavirus disease disaster.@@@After the weakening of the pandemic, the hopes for rearranging the broken societal and economic links brought some optimism, but then the war in Ukraine erupted.@@@It exacerbated crises of various kinds and destroyed not only thousands of human lives.@@@but also the optimism that we would be able to build back better.@@@The systematic erosion of democracy and human rights and the rise of authoritarianism are completing the picture.@@@The consensus that humankind may live according to the rules of an internationally adopted world order is blatantly violated.@@@Those rules, which have been forged in this green marble United Nations Hall, are now vehemently contested.@@@All those negative developments are about to distract our attention from the challenges that may turn out to be equally deadly for humankind.@@@The triple planetary crisis of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution threatens life on our planet.@@@All those risks and challenges must be addressed with full consciousness of the fact that the future of our civilization is at stake.@@@The first mission that leaders must see as their historical vocation at this crossroads for humankind is to rebuild trust in multilateralism and to uphold the rules-based international order, which must serve the firm will of all peoples to live in peace.@@@That is the fundamental precondition for survival and for embarking on the path of building prosperity.@@@Restoring peace and security is our most pressing priority.@@@Nineteen months ago, a permanent member of the Security Council unleashed a war of aggression against its neighbouring country, violating the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law.@@@From day one.@@@Bulgaria has strongly condemned the aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine.@@@Every day of this war threatens global peace and security.@@@Moreover, it has turned into a war of attrition, challenging economic and social development worldwide.@@@The latest events show an increasing risk of spillover in the Black Sea region, affecting countries neighbouring Ukraine.@@@An important priority of the seventy-eighth session of the General Assembly should be to find modalities that could pave a way towards restoring peace in Ukraine.@@@What we need is stronger political will, diplomacy and active talks about comprehensive, just and sustainable peace, based on the internationally recognized United Nations Charter.@@@Bulgaria is deeply concerned about the decision of the Russian Federation to withdraw from the Black Sea Grain Initiative.@@@The bombing of the Ukrainian harbour infrastructure and the restriction of navigation in the Black Sea leads to further global food insecurity, especially in the Global South, where the price of the war is particularly high.@@@The maintenance of international peace and security faces challenges all over the world.@@@The attention is now turned towards Ukraine because that conflict has a growing potential to turn into a global disaster.@@@We are deeply concerned about the potential victims of each and every war and conflict.@@@Human lives are equally precious all around the globe.@@@The Middle East and the use of violence in the Israel-Palestine conflict are a source of great concern.@@@We call on all parties to refrain from the use of force and to resume direct negotiations leading to a fair and sustainable two-State solution.@@@The political solution to the ongoing conflict in Syria marks the only way ahead.@@@Bulgaria maintains its unwavering position in support of the unity and sovereignty of Yemen.@@@We support the international efforts for peaceful solutions and humanitarian assistance for the entire region.@@@On Afghanistan, we emphasize the importance of preventing terrorist threats and irregular migration.@@@We strongly condemn the Taliban’s actions, exacerbating the human rights situation, especially of women and girls, ethnic and religious minorities and human rights defenders.@@@My country is a strong supporter of the European path of the Western Balkan countries as the most effective way for stabilizing the region.@@@Good neighbourly relations, comprehensive reforms and the fulfilment of accession criteria are the core of integration process.@@@Bulgaria is a staunch supporter of further strengthening the global nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation architecture.@@@We call for dialogue among nuclear-weapon States on confidence-building.@@@Russia’s suspension of its participation in the New START Treaty is a cause for great concern.@@@Its intention to deploy nuclear weapons in Belarus undermines the strategic stability and the overall security architecture.@@@We call on Russia to prove its commitment to the 3 January 2022 joint statement on preventing nuclear war and avoiding arms races.@@@We call on Iran to return to its obligations under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, and on the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to stop challenging international non-proliferation agreements.@@@The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)@@@Summit is a vital opportunity to get the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development back on track.@@@Access to financing and strong partnerships between the United Nations and international financial institutions is key to achieving sustainable development.@@@Bulgaria is actively engaged in focusing their activities on effective financial support for all countries in need.@@@The Global Digital Compact should harness the potential of digital technologies to accelerate the achievement of the SDGs.@@@Our digital future and artificial intelligence should be guided by a human- centred approach based on human rights, democracy and the rule of law.@@@Bulgaria welcomes the adoption of political declarations at the three health summits during this high-level Week.@@@Those documents of high-political commitment will foster the One Health approach, thus contributing to the strength of national health systems and the global health architecture.@@@The coronavirus disease pandemic resulted in a setback in the realization of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, especially with regard to education.@@@We support the vision of the Secretary- General for the creation of learning societies, for recognizing education and lifelong learning as a public good, and we stand ready to deliver on the commitments made at the 2022 Transforming Education Summit.@@@During these days, we have spoken a lot about peace among nations, but we also need to make peace with nature.@@@Climate change is a threat multiplier and mitigating it is essential.@@@Decisive climate action is a pressing global imperative and a test for the ability of the multilateral system to respond.@@@Urgent action is crucial to halt and reverse biodiversity loss.@@@Bulgaria welcomes the recently established Global Biodiversity Framework Fund and the adoption of the agreement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.@@@Sustainable water management is critical to the achievement of the entire 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@This year we celebrate the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.@@@This remarkable document is a powerful enabler of equality, fundamental freedoms and justice.@@@Bulgaria remains a firm supporter of the mandate of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and of the United Nations human rights system at large.@@@Strongly committed to further advancing the human rights agenda worldwide, my country has presented its candidature to the Human Rights Council for the 2024-2026 period and will strive to ensure its wide support and successful implementation.@@@As co-Chair of the Group of Friends on Children and Armed Conflict.@@@Bulgaria consistently advocates for the rights of the child, an issue that ranks high among our priorities as member of the Executive Boards of UNICEF and UN-Women.@@@Investing in children’s health, nutrition, education and protection from violence is crucial for responding to the basic principle of leaving no one behind of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@My country consistently emphasizes issues such as gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls, promoting the rights of people with disabilities and fighting against discrimination and hate speech.@@@This year Bulgaria also commemorated the eightieth anniversary of the rescue of the entire Jewish population of my country, amounting to 50.000 people during the Second World War.@@@That remarkable episode of our modern history inspires us to continue efforts to affirm tolerance and understanding as core values of modern democracy.@@@Taking into account the increasing challenges to the fundamental principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter.@@@Bulgaria welcomes efforts to increase the transparency and accountability of the Security Council and is a co-sponsor of landmark resolution 76/262, on the use of the veto.@@@While the veto initiative has further empowered the General Assembly, genuine reform of the Security Council remains a difficult and sensitive issue.@@@Bulgaria would like to see the Council be more effective in carrying out its primary responsibility.@@@Allocating at least one additional non-permanent seat to the Group of Eastern European States in a future reformed Security Council remains a priority for us.@@@I am pleased to extend to you.@@@Sir, and to the representatives of nations gathered here the warm greetings of Pope Francis, while also congratulating Mr. Dennis Francis on his election as President of the Assembly.@@@The Holy See wishes to commend him on the topic for this general debate and cannot agree more that there is an overwhelming need to start rebuilding trust in order to reignite global stability, peace and prosperity.@@@In recent decades, the Organization has witnessed an increase in activities on various fronts, including laudable initiatives aimed at reducing poverty, helping migrants, combating climate change, promoting nuclear disarmament and offering humanitarian aid, along with multiple others.@@@On the other hand, in these past years, we have seen crumbling trust among nations, clear evidence of which is the increase in number and gravity of conflicts and wars.@@@Furthermore, the current conflict in Ukraine has made all the more evident the crisis that has long affected the multilateral system, which needs a profound rethinking if it is to respond adequately to the challenges of our time.@@@All of that has resulted in an inevitable and equally significant increase in the number of meetings held at different levels, though not always in direct proportion to the effectiveness required in pursuing the proposed goals.@@@We witness a marked tendency of States to impose their own ideas and agenda.@@@Pope Francis calls that “ideological colonization”.@@@It is necessary to return to listening and dialogue in order to solve and avoid further conflict and lessen the suffering of humankind.@@@The international community must maintain the universality of global multilateral forums and not turn them into clubs reserved for a few elites, who think alike and where some are simply tolerated as long as they do not bother anyone.@@@In that sense.@@@I would highlight the following key words for effective multilateralism: dialogue, shared responsibility and cooperation, each in the pursuit of the common good and all under the banner of solidarity that comes from knowing that we are responsible for the fragility of others by seeking a common destiny.@@@All States must rediscover a spirit of service with the intention of building a global solidarity that expresses itself concretely in helping those who suffer — a task that serves not ideas but people.@@@Indeed, any reform of the United Nations must be based on rendering what is already existing more efficient and in line with the current era we are living in.@@@In that respect, the multilateral system has shifted its focus from the peaceful coexistence of States to issues that are not that relevant for that purpose, preferring issues pertinent to the lives and patterns of individuals.@@@Thus, a real reform of the United Nations must favour a reversal of the current priorities, making the United Nations truly fit for purpose and reviving coordination among States to achieve truly common ends — in other words, going back to the basics, while restoring the healthy distinction between the actions of States and those of civil society, focusing on rebuilding healthy relations and trust among Nations.@@@The conflict in Ukraine has been instrumental to bringing back the elevated threat of nuclear escalation into the discussion.@@@Once again, it is the firm conviction of the Holy See that the use of atomic energy for purposes of war is, today more than ever, a crime not only against the dignity of human beings, but against any possible future for our common home, while the mere possession itself of nuclear weapons is also immoral.@@@In that context, there is need to instil an ambitious programme of work for the second Meeting of States Parties to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW), including the advancement of discussions on the creation of an international trust fund to support a restorative approach to the human and environmental harms caused by nuclear use and testing.@@@The Holy See calls on States to sign and ratify the TPNW, as well the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test- Ban Treaty and the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which together form the basis for the disarmament and non-proliferation regime.@@@Another important challenge that we have at hand could be defined more generally as the expanding digital galaxy we inhabit, and specifically artificial intelligence.@@@There is an urgent need to engage in serious ethical reflection on the use and integration of supercomputer systems and processes in our daily 
lives.@@@We must be vigilant and work to ensure that the discriminatory use of those instruments does not take root at the expense of the most fragile and excluded.@@@It is not acceptable that the decision about someone’s life and future should be entrusted to an algorithm.@@@That is valid in all situations, including in the development of use of lethal autonomous weapons systems (LAWS).@@@Recently, a growing number of legal and ethical concerns have been raised, about the use of LAWS in armed conflicts.@@@It is clear that their use should be in line with international humanitarian law.@@@The Holy See supports the establishment of an international organization for artificial intelligence, aimed at facilitating the fullest possible exchange of scientific and technological information for peaceful uses and for the promotion of the common good and integral human development.@@@Moreover, the development of new technologies should go hand in hand with the care for our common home.@@@New technologies should be used to mitigate the planetary crisis of climate change, pollution and biodiversity loss, and it is urgent that we act now to safeguard the world we live in.@@@The international community needs to focus on a positive outcome at the forthcoming twenty-eighth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in the United Arab Emirates, without reducing the discussions on climate change to financing issues.@@@This year we are marking the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the thirtieth anniversary of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action.@@@The significant anniversaries of those documents invite us to engage in an in-depth reflection on the foundation of human rights and respect for them in the contemporary world in order to renew commitments in favour of the defence of human dignity.@@@In the world today, numerous forms of injustice persist; while one part of humankind lives in opulence, another part sees its own dignity denied, scorned or trampled upon, and its fundamental rights disregarded or violated.@@@First and foremost among those are the unborn, who are denied the right to come into the world.@@@Let us never forget that the true litmus test to see if human rights are being protected is the degree to which people have freedom of religion or belief in a country.@@@Disturbingly, we continue to live in a world where people are persecuted simply for professing their faith in public.@@@There are many countries where religious freedom is severely restricted.@@@Indeed, about one-third of the world’s population lives in that condition and the number only seems to be growing.@@@Along with the lack of religious freedom, there is also outright religious persecution.@@@I cannot fail to mention that one Christian in every seven is persecuted.@@@Moreover, violence against Christians is on the increase and not only in countries where they are a minority.@@@Even the terms “hate crime” and “hate speech” are now being used subjectively and manipulated to keep people from expressing their religious beliefs, equating the practice of religion to violence.@@@That purposefully dishonest, politically motivated agenda, especially egregious in the West, must end.@@@Despite the fact that so many tragedies have struck and are still shaking the family of nations this year, amid natural disasters, severe food security problems and political instability, causing anguish, hardship and uncertainty about the future, the Russian attack on Ukraine remains one of the most painful and bleeding wounds, which instead of healing is widening and deepening.@@@Undoubtedly, in more than 18 months of war, we have witnessed the admirable, ever-renewed commitment of so many countries to helping the battered Ukraine defend its people and its territory.@@@Unfortunately, however, that has not been accompanied by an equal effort to find ways in which the confrontation can be overcome.@@@We remain far from true encounter and dialogue so as to put an end to the hatred, destruction and death and open paths of peace and reconstruction.@@@That is what the Holy See, apart from its humanitarian assistance, hopes for and seeks to promote with each of its countless appeals and initiatives, dependent on the cooperation of all international actors.@@@The humanitarian situation in Syria is indeed worrisome.@@@Syrians, plagued by 12 years of war, earthquake and great poverty, are once again sounding the alarm, expressing their great hardships and demanding that a solution to their sufferings be found.@@@The Holy See, in addition to encouraging the resumption of a political process of reconciliation, calls for humanitarian emergencies not to be weighed against the rigidities of political positions, but to have the courage to look at the suffering of the people with truth and honesty, so that the international sanctions imposed on the Syrian Government by the European 
Union, the United States and the United Kingdom do not afflict the local population.@@@The situation in the Sudan also continues to be of great concern.@@@Over the past six months, armed clashes have resulted in a high number of victims and displaced persons, as well as a very serious humanitarian crisis, increasingly distancing the prospect of achieving peace and restoring stability to the country.@@@The Holy See makes a heartfelt appeal for the laying down of arms so that dialogue can prevail and the suffering of the population can be alleviated.@@@The Holy See closely follows political events in sub-Saharan Africa and renews its commitment to the promotion of peace, justice and prosperity.@@@Local churches contribute to national reconciliation processes and act with a view to the common good, especially in the educational, charitable and health sectors.@@@Of particular concern in sub-Saharan Africa have been the numerous episodes of violence, as well as the frequent coups that disrupt democratic processes, cause death and destruction, and cause humanitarian and migration crises.@@@It is painful to discover that, sometimes, behind episodes of terrorism and violence, there are also international economic interests that encourage the unjust dynamics of colonialism.@@@In that regard.@@@I appeal to the family of nations gathered here in the General Assembly to let the spirit of dialogue prevail, to cease all kinds of economic and financial exploitation, and to take care to foster generous and respectful international cooperation.@@@A special thought goes to Nicaragua, with which the Holy See hopes to engage in respectful diplomatic dialogue for the good of the local Church and of the entire population.@@@The Holy See urges dialogue and negotiations between Azerbaijan and Armenia, with the support of the international cooperation, which will favour a sustainable agreement as soon as possible, thus ending the humanitarian crisis and resolving the dramatic situation in Nagorno-Karabakh.@@@In addition.@@@I express my condolences to the families of the victims of the explosion at a petrol station near the city of Stepanakert.@@@The Holy See expresses serious concern about what is happening in Jerusalem, and in particular the attacks against the Christian communities.@@@Those episodes are not simply undermining the coexistence between the different communities, but are threatening the very identity of the city of Jerusalem, which some cannot conceive as a meeting place between the three faiths: Christianity.@@@Judaism and Islam.@@@I renew my appeal to the international community to ensure that Jerusalem is not forgotten, so that the project of a holy city as a place of peace for all and of all, with a special internationally guaranteed status, is not abandoned.@@@Today’s globalized world has brought all of us closer together, yet it has not made us any more fraternal.@@@Indeed, we are suffering from a famine of fraternity.@@@New ideologies, characterized by widespread individualism, egocentrism and materialistic consumerism, weaken social bonds, fuelling the throwaway mentality that leads to contempt for and abandonment of the weakest and those considered useless.@@@In that way, human coexistence increasingly tends to resemble a mere@@@do ut des@@@that is both pragmatic and selfish.@@@Yet the worst effect of this famine of fraternity is armed conflict and war, which make enemies of not only individuals but entire peoples, and whose negative consequences reverberate for generations.@@@With the founding of the United Nations, it seemed that the world had learned, after two terrible world wars, to move towards a more stable peace, moving towards becoming a literal family of nations.@@@However, it seems that we are backlogging history.@@@In order to make peace a reality, we must move away from the logic of the legitimacy of war.@@@Peace is possible if it is truly willed; and if peace is possible, it is a duty.@@@It is the duty of each one present in this Hall, because it is only in the research of peace and in the peaceful living between States that we can become truly united nations in a single human family.@@@Some people, including here in this Hall, are pessimistic about the state of the world today.@@@I beg to differ.@@@There are good reasons for optimism.@@@Since the start of the new millennium, we have made tremendous progress in the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@Today there is more universal access to education than ever before.@@@Eighty-five per cent of young children worldwide are in primary education.@@@Since the start of the century, an additional 2 billion people have had access to safe drinking water.@@@It shows that if we put our minds to it, and if promises are followed by investments, we can make global progress.@@@Of course, the picture is not rosy across the board.@@@Our changing climate is reason for concern.@@@This year we have witnessed some extreme climate events — forest fires in Greece.@@@Spain.@@@Canada and Hawaii, floods in Libya and Hong Kong and long periods of drought and water stress in my own country.@@@But, in that regard too, let us look at the trends rather than the events.@@@Let us look at our recent climate track record, and we will see that there is reason for grounded optimism.@@@A record-breaking €340 billion has been invested in renewable energy globally this year.@@@Prices of renewables keep on going down year after year.@@@Many climate analysts believe that carbon emissions will peak as soon as 2025, and will keep going down afterwards, provided that we keep up the investment pace in renewables.@@@The Executive Director of the International Energy Agency called it the beginning of the end of the fossil fuel era.@@@He said that it shows that our climate policies work.@@@We should therefore stop listening to the alarmists who proclaim that all is lost and that we are on a road to nowhere.@@@How can we expect public opinion to rally behind the climate cause with such blatant defeatism?@@@We should not despair; we should organize.@@@We should speed up the green transition instead of talking ourselves down and, in order to do that, we need to include our industry through a new industrial deal.@@@We will not build a climate paradise on an industrial wasteland.@@@We need our industry for its innovation capacity to come up with tomorrow’s climate solutions.@@@That is why Europe not only should be a continent of industrial innovation, but also should remain a continent of industrial production — clean technology, for sure, but also green chemistry, green steel production and green construction sites.@@@All are needed to build our net zero future.@@@That new industrial deal will be one of the major priorities of the Belgian presidency of the Council of the European Union (EU), starting on 1 January 2024.@@@But, to make that industrial deal a success, we should look beyond Europe.@@@We need partnerships, especially between Europe and Africa.@@@The foundation stones are there.@@@Belgium has partnered with countries such as Namibia.@@@Morocco and Egypt to accelerate the green transition in wind, in solar and in hydrogen.@@@Investments are pouring in, creating local employment, building up local expertise and soon exporting clean molecules from the shores of Africa to our North Sea ports.@@@We work at home as well.@@@Together with Germany.@@@France, the Netherlands.@@@Luxembourg.@@@Denmark.@@@Norway.@@@Ireland and the United Kingdom, we are turning the North Sea into a big green power plant for Europe.@@@By 2030, we will reach 120 gigawatts of wind energy at sea — the equivalent of more than 50 nuclear plants and enough to provide more than 100 million households with clean, affordable power.@@@We are making progress on the nuclear front as well.@@@Belgium has reached an agreement with its nuclear operator to prolong the lifespan of its two biggest power plants.@@@We will remain a nuclear nation, and we will seek renewed close cooperation with other nuclear nations because, to achieve climate neutrality, we will need both renewables and nuclear.@@@It is vital to win the fight against climate change, since it is the single-biggest disruptor of our societies today.@@@It causes young people to flee their home country en masse.@@@That increased irregular migration deprives the South of its most important economic resource and its most vital potential — young people.@@@At the same time, the host countries in Europe are faced with an influx that they can barely handle.@@@We are facing an uphill battle to accommodate all migrants and integrate them into our society.@@@The heart of the problem is that migration, as we know it today, depends on sheer luck.@@@The current model gives all the control and power to human smugglers.@@@They decide on life or death.@@@They decide on who enters a country and who does not.@@@That is simply unacceptable, unsustainable and immoral.@@@It is a lose-lose situation for everyone involved.@@@We need to rebuild the current migration model.@@@That is why, during the Belgian EU presidency, we hope to conclude a new European migration pact — a pact that makes sure that every EU country does its part of the work, enforcing solidarity, standardizing and fast- tracking procedures and working on common European readmission and return policies, and, last but not least, a pact to strengthen our common borders.@@@But a new EU migration pact is only part of the answer.@@@We should also work on one of the biggest root causes of migration, and that is poverty and the lack of economic opportunities.@@@In that regard too, as with climate change, partnerships are the answer — partnerships between Europe and the countries of transit and origin and partnerships that build solid, inclusive institutions to create equal rights and equal opportunities for all, not just for a small ruling class.@@@Fixing migration also means creating legal channels to Europe through education and talent programmes to strengthen societies in the home countries, turning a lose-lose situation into a win-win one so that young Africans can pursue the African dream and not have to risk their lives at sea for the European dream or the American dream.@@@To empower people also means holding the powerful to account.@@@Unfortunately, we live in a world in which more and more strongmen come to power.@@@Take the Sahel region, faced with a major security crisis and gripped by a perfect storm of terrorism, poverty and climate change.@@@That triple threat is undermining societies in Burkina Faso.@@@Mali and the Niger.@@@We need to stop the territorial and institutional disintegration of the Sahel.@@@Our track record in the Sahel should be a reason for humility, but it should not lead to indifference.@@@The only way forward is to restore the rule of law.@@@Without it, self-government will never be possible.@@@Without the rule of law, the Sahel will always be a potential playground for foreign bullies, wherever they come from.@@@It must be said that the clear and current danger is coming from a permanent member of the Security Council — from Russia, which decided to throw all international rules overboard and to invade its neighbour; from Russia, which is executing its opponents.@@@Russia created the Wagner Group to bring death and destruction to Africa, plundering that continent, while increasing the price of grain for the most vulnerable.@@@In fact, what the Wagner Group and Putin are doing to Africa is exactly the same as in Ukraine — preventing Africa from flourishing, denying African countries their sovereignty and, ultimately, as in Ukraine, colonizing.@@@Putin and the Wagner Group want to turn the clock back.@@@They want to restore the old world order, as it was dominated by colonial Powers.@@@The decolonization and emancipation of African.@@@Asian and South American countries are the most important achievements of our post-World War order.@@@We should protect that legacy and shield it from new forms of imperialism.@@@Each of us has a choice to make as to whose side to pick — the side of the colonizer or the side of the victim.@@@When we make those choices, the best guiding principle that I can think of is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.@@@We celebrate its seventy-fifth birthday this year.@@@The Universal Declaration of Human Rights remains the spinal cord of all human rights treaties and instruments.@@@In fact, the rights defined in the treaty are much older than 75 years.@@@The West African Mandinka nation, in what is nowadays Mali, had a Constitution as early as the year 1200.@@@It spoke of the sanctity of human life, women’s rights and the right to an education, food security and even self-expression.@@@When the freed slaves of Haiti, at the start of the nineteenth century, finally had the freedom to choose their own destiny, they defined living in dignity as living in liberty and equality.@@@Let us therefore remember such stories and recognize the true universality of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.@@@Let us also remember the progress that we have made as a common humankind and, when we look back on our achievements, know that they were always the result of hard work and of collaboration.@@@Now more than ever, we need the United Nations and the world to come together to secure progress that works for everyone.@@@It is indeed a privilege to once again be addressing the General Assembly on behalf of the people of Malta.@@@As I was preparing my remarks.@@@I was reminded of those timeless lines by the poet John Donne: “No man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main”.@@@Malta is a proud island nation, but we are most definitely not an island entire of ourselves — quite the reverse.@@@Throughout our history, we have looked outward to the world, conscious of our unique geographic position at the crossroads of Europe and Africa and consciously stepping up into a unique role, building bridges and building understanding between different traditions.@@@Indeed, earlier this month, we were very proud to be just such a bridge, trusted by both sides to host private talks between the United States National Security Adviser and China’s Foreign Minister.@@@Malta provided a safe space for vital discussions between the world’s two biggest Powers.@@@And it is to build bridges just like this that, almost 60 years ago, the Republic of Malta was admitted as a full Member of this United Nations.@@@It is a sign of the confidence our fellow Members place in Malta’s commitment to working together for the common good that they elected our nation to serve on the Security Council for this year and next.@@@It is why, embedded at the heart of our Constitution is the active pursuit of peace, security and social progress among all nations.@@@Malta will always be open to the world.@@@Malta will never turn its back on its neighbours.@@@Malta will continue to work relentlessly with our partners in Europe and beyond to stand up for peace and the rule of law.@@@Sadly, the need to stand up for those values has rarely been more urgent or more important than it is today.@@@We witness Russia’s violation of international law with its continued assault on Ukraine.@@@Malta’s response to the situation in Ukraine and other crises across the world is guided by the values of neutrality enshrined in our Constitution.@@@Malta’s neutrality does mean that we will continue to be directly opposed to military aggression and unilateral action against members of the global community and the rules-based order, but Malta’s neutrality does not mean that we are indifferent to what happens around us.@@@We will never and can never be neutral when we see pain and suffering caused by an illegal invasion.@@@In that spirit of peace, we call on Russia to withdraw its forces from the sovereign territory of Ukraine and we urge all the nations gathered here to unite to deliver an end to the war.@@@The tragedy of war is not just that those directly involved suffer, but also that the consequences reverberate around the world.@@@The already precarious situation of global food security has been made much worse by the invasion of Ukraine.@@@An estimated additional 122 million people across the world have been pushed into hunger since 2019.@@@Malta urges Russia to rejoin the Black Sea Grain Initiative and to stop standing in the way of vital food supplies leaving Ukraine to feed the world’s most needy.@@@Being neutral has never meant that Malta ignores the problems facing our neighbours.@@@We are acutely aware that many of the challenges we face at home are best tackled together with our Mediterranean neighbours.@@@That is why I am very proud that our capital.@@@Valletta, will host the next summit of the members of the European Union MED9 in just a few days’ time.@@@The most pressing issue in the Mediterranean is definitely that of Libya.@@@The peace of our whole region depends on a lasting settlement there.@@@Malta wishes to see a peaceful, stable and prosperous Libya through a Libyan-led political process.@@@It is vital that the entire international community encourage the process and give the Libyan people the support they need to overcome the instability, for which they have already paid such a high price.@@@The need to recover and rebuild after the tragic devastation of Storm Daniel underlines the urgency and importance of a lasting settlement that gives all Libyans the effective Government they deserve.@@@For Malta, being a good neighbour means offering practical help.@@@Within hours of the disaster hitting, a team from our Army and Civil Protection Department was on the way to Libya to play its part in the rescue effort.@@@Maltese officers also remain on active service with the United Nations in Lebanon, proudly wearing blue berets as part of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon and underlining the importance Malta attaches to peacekeeping and peace-building in the Mediterranean.@@@As the nation at the crossroads of Europe and Africa, our extended neighbourhood stretches beyond the Mediterranean coast.@@@Our objective is to be a true bridge between the continents.@@@My Government has underlined Malta’s commitment to Africa by opening new diplomatic missions in Ghana and Ethiopia and putting into action our first national strategy for Africa.@@@But strengthening connections does not just mean strengthening diplomatic ties.@@@We have already concluded agreements with countries like Ethiopia to facilitate connectivity for businesses and people between the continents.@@@Malta remains deeply disturbed by the dire security situation in the Sahel, including the political turmoil, irregular migration, the jihadist attacks on the civilian population and food insecurity.@@@We are particularly concerned about the current situation in the Niger and underline the urgency of a peaceful resolution to the crisis.@@@From Ukraine to Mali.@@@Libya to the Niger, it can all too often seem like we are living in an era of despair.@@@And the problems the world faces are indeed deep and profound.@@@It would be all too easy and all too understandable to fall into despondency and to think that nothing can be done.@@@But in the rest of my remarks.@@@I want to show that things can be done, that we can make a difference, and that if a small nation like Malta can play its part in addressing the most urgent issues 
our world faces, then the United Nations can put in place real and effective solutions globally.@@@I began with the famous quotation that “no man is an island”.@@@Leaders cannot be an island, either.@@@Our fine words to the Assembly must not stand alone; they must be directly connected to our actions at home and the priorities of our people.@@@We must show through deeds, not just words, that we can address the fears, as well as the hopes and aspirations, of the people we represent.@@@One of the advantages of being Prime Minister of a small country is that you are very close to the people you represent.@@@You hear loud and clear what is worrisome them.@@@One of the persistent worries I hear is that people feel a niggling sense of insecurity.@@@Post pandemic, they feel that the world is a less stable, increasingly scary place, and with such big global forces at play, too often citizens can feel like they do not have their hands on the levers that control their futures.@@@I understand where those concerns are coming from.@@@Addressing them is why I am into politics.@@@It is why I am adamant that every global policy we put in place must make a difference locally and that we can show that by working together internationally, we can deliver solutions nationally.@@@In that way, we can address what pessimists call the “new age of insecurity” by building a new age of security.@@@Yet, we must be realistic.@@@There is no magic wand.@@@I am realistic about what any individual nation can do, and I am acutely aware there is only so much a small nation can do.@@@But if we all play our part, we can all make a difference.@@@In short, we are stronger together.@@@No one can feel secure about their family’s future unless they feel secure about the future of the planet on which we all live and the natural world on which we all depend.@@@The biggest threat to our planet is clearly climate change.@@@Climate change is not some sort of abstract problem; it is a very real emergency the consequences of which are being felt in every part of the world.@@@Current pledges and targets are not sufficient to keep the 1.5°C objective of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change within reach.@@@Malta wholeheartedly commends the Secretary-General’s initiative to help States accelerate efforts at the global level.@@@We must all play our part and work together.@@@The time for excuses is long over.@@@Malta is a proud maritime nation.@@@The sea plays a profound part in Malta’s national life and has a special place in the hearts of the Maltese people.@@@Rising sea levels are a severe threat to the security, the livelihood and, indeed, the very existence of island countries like ours.@@@Securing the future of our seas and oceans is an urgent imperative for the Government of Malta.@@@That is why we have made climate and oceans the number one priority during our term on the Security Council.@@@To give the debate new momentum, we made a high- level meeting on the implications of rising sea levels for peace and security the signature event of our presidency of the Security Council in February (see S/PV. 9260).@@@And we enthusiastically extend our support for the newly created coalition on addressing sea-level rise and existential threats.@@@It is not just the direct consequences of rising sea levels that we need to be concerned about.@@@As land is degraded, fresh water shortages, the displacement of people and food insecurity all risk undermining global security, generating new conflicts and exacerbating existing ones.@@@Rising sea levels also threaten the very territorial integrity of States as a result of coastal inundation, with a consequent danger of disputes and conflict.@@@I wish therefore to reiterate in the strongest terms, as I did at the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, that no coastal State should lose any of its existing rights over its maritime zones due to rising sea levels.@@@As a United Nations, we must preserve the sovereignty of coastal States, no matter what the ravages of the sea.@@@As island nations, we turn to the world, but we do not turn our backs on each other.@@@Solidarity among small island countries is a key value for Malta and a value that we turn into practical support.@@@Like the majority of nations in the United Nations.@@@Malta was late to develop, and we have experienced many of the same challenges that are currently being faced by developing countries.@@@That is why we have made raising awareness of the unique vulnerabilities of small island developing States (SIDs) a top priority and why supporting sustainable development for small island developing States is a cornerstone of our foreign policy.@@@To do so, we are committed to our Island for Islands initiative, delivering concrete, practical support for those small island nations — the nations most exposed to the impact of climate change.@@@We share best practices and help build capacity.@@@We were delighted that Malta’s scholarship programme for students from small island developing States has been recognized with a United Nations SIDs Partnerships award.@@@Protecting our planet is a mammoth task, but by taking visible, measurable action we can, and we must. 
show our citizens that they have reason to believe in the security of the Earth’s future.@@@There are those who say that securing the planet can be achieved only at the expense of economic growth.@@@I firmly reject that thinking.@@@In fact.@@@I believe the reverse is true.@@@Environmental security can be achieved only if citizens feel economic security.@@@Only if you feel secure about your family’s economic well-being can you turn your attention to the well-being of the Earth.@@@And it is only by delivering sustainable economic growth that we can deliver sustainable environmental protection.@@@From the perspective of an outward-facing, trading nation like Malta, there is one overwhelming, clear and present danger to economic security — the prospect of a new era of protectionism.@@@If protectionism grows unchecked, it could do untold damage to an export- oriented island economy like ours.@@@The Maltese people have benefited hugely from the opening up of the world economy.@@@As vested interests have given way to innovation, they have seized the new opportunities.@@@Like many young economies.@@@Malta has harnessed digital technology and the breaking down of trade and tariff barriers to expand into sectors that were previously off- limits to small nations like ours.@@@What the world economy and the world’s citizens need is not a new era of protectionism.@@@Instead, we need a new age of social protection —not putting up barriers to trade but putting in place standards and rights for our workers.@@@I understand and appreciate how some people may feel left behind by the sheer pace of economic change this century.@@@The pandemic showed the need to think through the geopolitical risks of supply chains.@@@But the answer is not to turn back the clock.@@@The answer is to get the future right.@@@One of the themes of this year’s General Assembly is rebuilding trust to achieve sustainability for all, and that is exactly what we must do.@@@Too often, smaller and developing countries have been excluded from the decision-making process and have suffered as a result.@@@Malta is clear — trust on trade can be achieved only if genuine solidarity is maintained with all Member States.@@@Open trading should be fair trading.@@@Open economies should be fair economies.@@@Only with fairness will citizens’ sense of security be rebuilt.@@@I came into politics passionate about building a country where decision-making is based on fairness and opportunity, with a commitment to equality that is also a commitment to competitiveness.@@@Let us consider gender equality.@@@Empowering women powers economic growth.@@@One of our Government’s proudest achievements is the introduction of free childcare that has enabled more parents to re-enter the workforce, increasing women’s economic power and increasing growth for the economy as a whole.@@@I am proud to be speaking in the same month that Malta hosted a hugely successful EuroPride the crowning recognition of the transformation in our nation’s approach to LGBTIQ+ rights that has taken place since my party was returned to Government, and a huge boost to our island’ profile and our island’s economy.@@@And let us also look at closing the digital divide.@@@Equipping more citizens of all ages and from all backgrounds with the digital skills they need both increases their individual earning power and adds to the nation’s productivity.@@@That is why we have extended information and communications technology as a compulsory subject in all our upper secondary schools.@@@Malta therefore calls on the international community to work harder to ensure that the digital divide is narrowed, not just within each nation but also globally.@@@Similarly, upholding the rights of the child — as enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child — is of paramount importance to Malta.@@@We work hard to ensure that each and every child has the opportunities she or he deserves, no matter what the circumstances of her or his birth.@@@By tackling child poverty and ensuring equal access to education and healthcare, we aim to ensure that no child is left behind.@@@Rightly, it is a moral imperative, but it is also an economic one.@@@Leaving any of the next generation of workers without the skills they need is not just damaging to the individuals excluded from prosperity; it is also damaging to economic growth.@@@None of us can feel secure unless every child in our societies is safe and secure.@@@One significant manifestation of the feeling of insecurity has been the growing number of people facing mental health difficulties.@@@None of us can feel secure unless we know that mental health is taken as seriously as physical health by our health-care systems.@@@Even if we do not have mental health issues ourselves, knowing that care and support are there should we or those we care for need it is part of the reassurance that an active State should provide.@@@To help provide that reassurance, in Malta we have implemented a comprehensive mental health strategy to build capacity, address causes and offer continuing support to individuals with mental 
health needs and their families, through initiatives like the National Mental Health Helpline launched last year, offering a one-stop.@@@24/7 resource to connect patients with the services they need.@@@One of the biggest drivers of mental health worries is fear of the future.@@@Indeed, none of us can feel secure about our lives if we do not feel secure about what is coming tomorrow.@@@Right now, one of the biggest fears many have is of technology.@@@We have lived through two decades of unprecedented change, from the basic mobile phone and text messaging to smart phones and face recognition.@@@It can often seem like society has lost control and that the technology itself is in charge.@@@And now, with the advent of generative artificial intelligence (Al), the risk is that this seems truer than ever.@@@How we feel about our futures is, unfortunately, not helped by lurid media headlines about the machines taking over, spreading fear about Al taking jobs and rendering human effort obsolete.@@@Let us be clear — Al will have a huge impact on all aspects of society, but let us also be clear that if as leaders we take the right decisions, that impact on our societies can be a positive one.@@@Again, as with trade, the answer is not to try and turn the clock back, to close our eyes to the inevitable and hope it will go away.@@@Instead, the answer is to get the future right, to take the decisions now so that we can harness the power of Al for the public and common good, not fear it as a coming catastrophe.@@@In Malta, we are already doing just that.@@@We are already seeing how Al can enhance public services, improving lives for all citizens.@@@We have six pilot projects covering areas from health care to traffic management.@@@We are taking ownership through leadership, not trying to ignore the future.@@@Naturally, however, there is a limit to what any one country especially a small one, can do.@@@To make Al a global good, we need global action.@@@Malta stands resolutely behind efforts to increase and enhance international cooperation on AL Technology is changing too fast, and its potential is so vast, that failing to work together is no longer an option.@@@Of course, it is not just in the tech field that we need to work together.@@@Working together is not only a key value for Malta; it is at the very centre of the political tradition I proudly represent.@@@Put simply, standing together, we can achieve so much more than working alone.@@@Yes, none of us nations, leaders or societies stands as islands isolated from each other.@@@We are all connected in ever more ways.@@@We live in a new age — in an age when you can send a video to the other side of the world faster than you can walk to the other side of the room you are sitting in; in an age when the decisions about how to generate energy in one country can impact the very survival of another country oceans away; in an age when the aggression of one country against another can lead to hunger across a different continent.@@@In such an age, the importance of working together will only become stronger.@@@The word for it — multilateralism — may not trip off the tongue, but it is more important than ever.@@@To make multilateralism work in this age of insecurity, we need to ensure that a much wider group of voices are heard in the United Nations and around the globe; the voices of all countries — large and small, rich, and poor, developed and developing; the voices of all sections of civil society — women, not just men, young as well as old, gay as well as straight; all backgrounds, all ethnicities.@@@I refuse to believe, and Malta refuses to believe, that a new age of insecurity is inevitable.@@@I know and Malta knows that we must build a new age of security, not by trying to turn the clock back but by getting the future right.@@@If we work together; if we listen to and learn from each other; if we understand and appreciate the desire of our citizens to take back control of their lives, we can and we will get the future right.@@@The world over today, hundreds of millions of people are besieged by anxiety about their present and future security, dignity and prospects of well-being.@@@Many are victims and witnesses of present assaults and many more are afraid of future violations of their most fundamental expectations.@@@In his opening address (see A/78/PV.4), our Secretary-General provided a graphic snapshot of the condition of the world and humankind, a situation that calls into question the state of multilateralism in terms of its founding aspirations, as well as its present agenda.@@@The poverty, fear, suffering and humanitarian distress haunting the victims of conflict, drought, famine, flooding, wildfires, cyclones, deadly disease outbreaks and other disasters are the outcomes of sustained violation of the most essential principles and the systematic neglect of humankind’s dearest values, which lie at the very foundation of the Charter of the United Nations.@@@The failure of peace and security systems, inadequate development and limited climate action, amidst technological advancement and enormous wealth, have left us in a state of paralysis, enduring one of the darkest periods of human existence.@@@We may all agree, without any fear of contradiction, that the world is headed in a most undesirable direction.@@@It is at moments like this that the affirmative spirit of multilateralism, international collective action and global solidarity are most needed and should be attainable.@@@This is not the occasion for any Member of the United Nations to escape when they should be rising to the challenge of the moment.@@@Resorting to the pursuit of narrow, insular and antisocial agendas, within exclusive clubs constituted to maintain the status quo that undermines and cannibalizes the United Nations system at the expense of progress in humankind’s collective journey to the future of our aspirations, is totally unacceptable.@@@The existence of those inimical cliques of geopolitical formations defies the fundamental values and principles of the United Nations system, and its operations have led to alienation, mistrust, insecurity and the exclusion of and among peoples, nations, regions and continents.@@@Moments like this place the nature and purpose of multilateralism under sharp scrutiny for history’s honest examination and judgment.@@@If any confirmation were ever needed that the Nations Security Council is dysfunctional, undemocratic, non-inclusive, unrepresentative and therefore incapable of delivering meaningful progress in our world as presently 
constituted, the rampant impunity of certain actors on the global scene settles the matter.@@@The environment of pervasive mistrust between the global North versus the global South, developed versus the developing, rich versus poor, polluters versus victims and net emitters versus net victims, which complicates and frustrates multilateralism, is the inevitable result of promises not kept, commitments not actualized, resolutions not honoured and principles not observed.@@@Multilateralism has been failed by the abuse of trust, negligence and impunity.@@@A year ago.@@@I stood in the Assembly Hall (see A/77/ PV.6) to call upon the global community to transform the United Nations system in order to achieve a consensus-driven, rules-based multilateral system that works for the people of the world in their diversity.@@@It is time for multilateralism to reflect the voice of the farmers, represent the hopes of villagers, champion the aspirations of pastoralists, defend the rights of fisherfolk, express the dreams of traders, respect the wishes of workers and, indeed, protect the welfare of all peoples of the world.@@@In the face of the most urgent crises of our time, it is now clear that the international community has fallen seriously behind in meeting its targets in both climate action and the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals, as well as their underlying enablers, peace and security.@@@We as Africa have come to the world, not to ask for alms, charity or hand-outs, but to work with the rest of the global community and give every human being in this world a decent chance of security and prosperity by taking necessary actions, mobilizing adequate resources for investment, confronting security challenges and resolving conflicts, as we also make our contribution to global prosperity.@@@Kenya is proud of the contributions it continues to make in its tireless endeavour to support peacemaking, conflict prevention, peacekeeping, peace-building and other interventions undertaken across different regions.@@@All across Africa, there is progress in efforts to resolve conflicts and restore peace and stability while, at the same time, we are witnessing setbacks to democratic consolidation in the form of unconstitutional changes to Government.@@@Kenya remains committed, determined and indefatigable in its contributions to unity, peace, security, stability and prosperity.@@@Often, we have made encouraging progress.@@@For example.@@@On 5 December 2022, the Juba Peace Agreement, ushering in a two-year transition, was signed by the parties to the conflict in the Sudan.@@@A day afterwards, the Inter-Congolese Dialogue, a process led by the East African Community (EAC), concluded its third session in Nairobi.@@@The following day, the Government of Somalia and Somaliland agreed to resume reconciliation.@@@We are also proud of the progress made in stabilizing eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo as a result of the EAC regional force, setting that country on the path to sustainable peace and stability.@@@In Ethiopia, the guns have fallen silent following the Pretoria and Nairobi agreements, while in South Sudan, the parties have committed to exploring ways to resume and conclude the stalled peace process and to hold elections.@@@Our proactive commitment to peace, which is not limited to our continent, inspired us to dispatch the African peace delegation, consisting of six African Heads of State, to Moscow and Kyiv with a 10-point peace plan, beginning with efforts to initiate a mediation process to resolve the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.@@@Although the delegation encountered significant challenges in its mission, we remain very proud that it showed up.@@@The hunger for peace and security in Africa is evident, and that bodes well for the prospects of attaining the African Union Agenda 2063 and global peace.@@@Kenya stands in solidarity with all humankind, without regard to region or border or hemisphere.@@@That is why and how we see the people of the Republic of Haiti, who are suffering immensely from the bitter legacy of slavery, colonialism, sabotage and neglect.@@@As a nation that was forced to wage a painful struggle for its own independence and sovereignty.@@@Kenya empathizes very deeply with the humiliation of the proud people of Haiti, the price they have had to pay for their hunger for liberty, and the sorrow they have endured for their thirst for freedom.@@@Haiti is the ultimate test of international solidarity and collective action.@@@The international community has failed that test so far, and thus let down a people very, very badly.@@@Haiti deserves better from the world.@@@The cry of our brothers and sisters, who were the first people to win their struggle for freedom from colonial tyranny, has reached our ears and touched our hearts.@@@Doing nothing in the face of the historic isolation, neglect and betrayal of the people of Haiti is out of the question.@@@Inaction is no longer an option.@@@As we mobilize to show up for Ukraine and countries that have experienced the devastating impact of climate shocks, including Libya.@@@Morocco and Hawaii, we must not leave Haiti behind.@@@We must commit to showing, up in the spirit of solidarity, to help a people regain their political and socioeconomic footing by reinforcing the underlying enabler: security.@@@Kenya is ready to play its part in full and jointly with a coalition of other nations of goodwill — and there are many — as a great friend and true sibling of Haiti.@@@We urge the United Nations to urgently deliver an appropriate framework to facilitate the deployment of multinational security support as part of a holistic response to Haiti’s challenges.@@@We call on the Security Council to contribute positively by adopting a resolution under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations that tailors the security support mission to the specific needs of Haiti and its people.@@@That should be part of a comprehensive strategy that includes delivering humanitarian aid, supporting livelihoods, instituting reforms and fostering a political process guided and owned by Haitians, all with the aim of enabling free and fair elections within a reasonable timeframe.@@@We are encouraged by many countries that have already stepped forward to take part in that solidarity.@@@We must recognize that stability, peace and security form the foundation on which the pursuit and realization of sustainable development and climate action stand.@@@That realization must enable us to formulate strategies that treat those initiatives as interconnected, mutually reinforcing and complementary dimensions of a single agenda.@@@The tragic spectacle of young people from Africa boarding rickety contraptions to gamble their lives away on dangerous voyages in pursuit of opportunities abroad, either as conflict, climate and economic refugees, is a testament to the failures of the global economic system.@@@At the recently concluded Africa Climate Summit in Nairobi, we undertook to begin the journey to course-correct and execute a paradigm shift in our pursuit of development and climate action.@@@First, we recognize that both climate action and the Sustainable Development Goals must be pursued simultaneously with greater resolve, urgency and ambition.@@@No meaningful development can take place in countries that are also struggling with climate shocks and yet, at the same time, the frequency of climate emergencies impedes any meaningful development.@@@As a defining outcome of the Africa Climate Summit, we committed Africa to consider the dual problems through an opportunity lens and to deliver effective solutions by pursuing a fresh trajectory.@@@Development is a basic necessity for every society; it must happen one way or another.@@@There should be no doubt about that.@@@Annually.@@@30 million young people on our continent need jobs and many more need food.@@@Half of our continent is in the dark, without access to electricity in 2023, while hundreds of millions can only cook using biomass, because they have no electricity.@@@That is why the commitment of African nations in the Nairobi Declaration is both radical and transformative.@@@Development, in our opinion, is a fundamental imperative and green growth is the only sustainable way to achieve it.@@@From our standpoint, there is no need to be trapped in a false choice; sustainable development is robust climate action and climate action is development.@@@Africa’s potential is defined by abundant and diverse resources, ranging from a youthful, highly skilled and motivated young population; immense renewable energy potential and mineral resources, including critical minerals; and extensive natural capital endowment, including 60 per cent of the world’s unutilized arable land.@@@Capital and technology can find no better returns anywhere than the tremendous investment opportunity in Africa’s potential.@@@Such investment would drive green growth, creating jobs and wealth while decarbonizing global production and consumption.@@@Furthermore, the investments would also connect over 600 million people to clean electricity; provide clean cooking to about a billion people; finance green manufacturing, including e-mobility; transform African agriculture and food systems, including the manufacture of green fertiliser; process the vast tonnage of the steel, aluminium and lithium required by new green industries; and enable our young people find the livelihoods they desire, at home, and reverse the tide of migration in the opposite direction.@@@To unlock financing at scale and create incentives for investments at scale in green opportunities, the Nairobi Declaration makes the reform of the international financial system a priority.@@@No meaningful climate action or development can take place in conditions of financial distress.@@@According to International Monetary Fund data, as of last month 10 low-income countries were already in debt distress and 52 were at high and moderate risk of falling into distress.@@@The 3.3 billion people in those counties are trapped in a vicious cycle 
of emergency responses, reconstruction and recovery from more frequent climate shocks, which diverts resources away from both development and climate action and sucks vulnerable countries into a downward spiral of debt and environmental stress.@@@The global community must therefore develop a debt restructuring initiative that does not wait for nations to plunge over the cliff into debt distress before providing relief.@@@Rather, the new sovereign debt architecture should extend the tenure of sovereign debt and provide a 10- year grace period for countries that are in debt distress.@@@The second financing intervention relates to concessional financing.@@@It is time to work with the international financial institutions to provide more concessional loans — in our estimate, to the tune of approximately $500 billion — and to provide increased liquidity support through special drawing rights, with a minimum target of $650 billion, which was the amount obtained during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.@@@Access should be based on specific needs, not entitlement, and that necessitates changes to the allocation mechanism, different from what we saw in the special drawing rights for COVID-19.@@@The third critical reform is that of the financial market reorganization.@@@The entire system of risk assessment, the opaque methodologies employed by credit rating agencies and risk analysis needs to be overhauled, at a minimum.@@@We must all recall the miscalculation of subprime mortgage risk by those agencies two decades ago, which precipitated a financial crisis whose effects reverberate to this day, and ask the following question: On what basis should we believe that their methodologies are better at assessing risks in faraway frontier markets like ours, which are far more difficult to measure objectively, than in assessing the value of financial assets in the markets where they actually operate, and which they got so disastrously wrong?@@@If they got it wrong then.@@@I bet they have it wrong now.@@@In any case, any objective rating must also take into account the principles of responsible sovereign lending and accounting, specifically emphasizing the need for international accounting systems that support the proper valuation of mineral wealth, natural capital and ecosystem services in the computation of national gross domestic products.@@@Until that is done, very wealthy countries will be categorized as poor.@@@The fourth limb of the interventions arising out of the Nairobi Declaration is the establishment of a global public climate financing mechanism, funded through a global carbon tax on trade in fossil fuels, as well as an emissions levy on aviation and maritime transport, including the option of a global financial transactions tax, in order to make available dedicated, affordable and accessible capital for green investments at scale.@@@The road map to that new and urgently needed institutional infrastructure involves the sustained engagement of various multilateral processes, and the instrument to actualize it by 2025 shall be a new global climate finance charter to be negotiated through the General Assembly, the twenty-eighth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and associated processes.@@@We understand the facts about our collective situation as a global community and as a member of the United Nations family.@@@We know the magnitude of our shared challenges and common threats.@@@We appreciate that multilateralism is on trial, and our task is to defend it.@@@We also recognize that multilateralism is broken, and it is our responsibility to repair it.@@@From this moment to 2030 and from our problems to their solutions, we are connected by a coherent agenda of robust collective action.@@@We must therefore muster the courage and will to stand together in solidarity and act to right past wrongs, solve present problems and secure our collective future; to protect and empower all people and support our friends in need; to restore broken trust, raise hope high and keep faith strong; and, finally, to pursue, achieve and sustain positive change in order to make billions of cherished dreams come true.@@@We must start right away, for we have no time to lose.@@@Looking back, we — the international community — did not acknowledge the signs for what they were.@@@The war in Georgia in 2008 and the aggression in Ukraine since 2014 and in Syria since 2015 clearly show that Russia has no scruples about using military force to reach its political ambitions, recreate its former colonial empire and undermine the European security order and the Charter of the United Nations.@@@We open this year’s session of the General Assembly at a time when a permanent member of the Security Council, a body tasked with the maintenance of international peace and security, has proven its complete disregard for human life, in Ukraine and globally.@@@Russia is weaponizing food and aggravating the global food crisis, most recently by reimposing 
its blockade against grain deliveries across the Black Sea, deliberately destroying Ukrainian grain and port infrastructure.@@@In doing so.@@@Russia is limiting the supply of food to many, including the world’s most vulnerable.@@@Meanwhile, the European Union (EU) solidarity lanes — the efforts to build alternative export routes for food from Ukraine — have become a lifeline.@@@Ukraine exports more than three million tons of grain every month through the solidarity lanes.@@@Sweden and the EU have also increased our humanitarian food aid globally and boosted support for local food production.@@@In blatant violation of international law.@@@Russia is attempting to deny Ukraine its right to exist as a sovereign nation.@@@If we allow that to happen.@@@Russia will only continue its imperial ambitions.@@@This will not stop with Ukraine.@@@Ukraine’s soldiers are fighting not only for Ukraine’s survival, but also for our security and for the respect of territorial integrity.@@@It is the sovereign right of every State to make its own security policy choices.@@@Exercising that right.@@@Sweden has applied for NATO membership — a historic decision that ends Sweden’s military non-alignment, which dates back to 1812.@@@Our NATO membership will increase the security of our country and — together with Finland’s membership — improve the stability in the entire Euro-Atlantic area.@@@Sweden will fulfil its commitments under the North Atlantic Treaty and to all other allies.@@@The General Assembly has repeatedly condemned Russia’s blatant violations of international law, including the United Nations Charter.@@@The Ukrainian people have suffered from attacks against schools, hospitals and civilian infrastructure.@@@Russia has abducted thousands of Ukrainian children.@@@The list of Russia’s crimes against international law in Ukraine is long.@@@Russia must, and will, be held to account.@@@Accountability, including for the crime of aggression, is a condition for justice to the victims and a deterrent against future violations.@@@Sweden supports the establishment of a tribunal for the crime of aggression committed against Ukraine.@@@The United Nations Charter also forms the basis of Ukraine’s peace formula, which is receiving support from a growing group of countries in all regions.@@@We welcome initiatives that will contribute to a just and lasting peace based on international law.@@@That is in the interest of all of us.@@@The world is indeed in a very different place compared to when the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development was adopted eight years ago.@@@The pace of poverty reduction has slowed down, humanitarian needs are rising, and climate change is accelerating.@@@The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Summit earlier this week was a much-needed opportunity to regain momentum towards achieving the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@Sweden is a committed partner of and contributor to the United Nations development system and a substantial donor of humanitarian assistance.@@@It is imperative that the United Nations development system continue to strive for increased effectiveness and efficiency, especially at the country level.@@@Swedish official development assistance is generous.@@@We are one of only a handful of countries in the world that reach the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of gross national income in development assistance.@@@Development assistance must work catalytically alongside trade, private investment, improved access to capital and domestic resource mobilization.@@@Strong national institutions remain a precondition for development.@@@Multilateral development banks play a critical role in achieving the SDGs, working with innovative financing and mobilizing financing at scale — both private capital and domestic resources.@@@We support the adaptation of their business model to better address global challenges, while keeping poverty reduction and climate change at the core of their mandate.@@@Sweden’s international development assistance responds to the multiple challenges the world is confronting today and contributes to positive development.@@@Sweden’s development assistance is relevant, long-term, efficient and transparent.@@@The Swedish Government focuses on poverty alleviation and health interventions for the most vulnerable, providing democracy assistance to defenders of human rights and democracy on all continents.@@@We invest in women’s and girls’ rights and opportunities across the globe.@@@Climate change is accelerating.@@@This July was the hottest month on record, with extreme weather causing widespread damage.@@@When the world meets for the twenty-eighth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP) in Dubai in November, we must unite around higher ambitions.@@@Sweden welcomes the Secretary- General’s strong personal commitment to push the global climate agenda forward.@@@We are pleased that the incoming United Arab Emirates presidency is framing climate action as a driver for prosperity and growth.@@@We must mobilize more climate finance, both public 
and private, and enhance support to local resilience and climate adaptation.@@@Sweden will continue to do its part, and we call on other countries to increase their contributions.@@@Climate finance is a key element of Swedish development assistance.@@@The ground-breaking solutions provided by Swedish businesses in such areas as battery production and fossil-free steel are driving climate action in Sweden and supporting the climate transition globally.@@@The synergies between innovation, trade and the private sector are fundamental to achieving the green transition and reaching the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@Emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence, are transforming our world.@@@They offer unprecedented possibilities, including to accelerate our efforts on climate change, global health and the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@This fast-moving development also entails challenges for international security and human rights.@@@Shaping a shared vision of new technologies, based on the values of the United Nations Charter, will be key to harnessing their potential and mitigate the risks.@@@Together with Rwanda.@@@Sweden is co-facilitating the process in the General Assembly of developing a global digital compact that will outline shared principles for an open, free and secure digital future for all.@@@The Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted 75 years ago.@@@We know for a fact that human rights, democracy and the rule of law are determinants of development.@@@Countries with high levels of democracy have 94 per cent lower infant mortality, provide 40 per cent more electricity and have 23 per cent more access to safe water than autocracies.@@@Building societies that are democratic, respect human rights and uphold the rule of law will be crucial to how fast we achieve the 2030 Agenda.@@@Let me underline in particular that women’s and girls’ enjoyment of human rights, including sexual and reproductive rights, is a key condition for development and a prerequisite for democracy.@@@Human rights are — and must be — universal.@@@They are not a privilege for the few.@@@They belong to everyone, everywhere.@@@In recent months.@@@Sweden has witnessed disrespectful burnings of the Qur’an.@@@Those acts of desecration are being carried out by extremists and provocateurs who seek to sow division between Muslims and non-Muslims.@@@We must not let those provocateurs succeed.@@@The Swedish Government is firm in strongly rejecting any act of intolerance.@@@Those offensive acts committed by individuals at demonstrations in Sweden do not reflect the opinion of the Swedish Government or that of the majority of the Swedish people.@@@Over the years.@@@Sweden has received a great number of Muslims and has strived to integrate the newcomers and their children into our society.@@@Sweden remains in close dialogue with the Muslim world and has invited the Secretary-General of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation to visit Sweden.@@@The rights to the freedom of religion, the freedom of assembly, the freedom of expression and the freedom to demonstrate are constitutional rights in Sweden.@@@Those freedoms have served our society and our social cohesion well and made us an open and free society.@@@The Swedish Government has decided to carry out an inquiry to review its public order act, which governs the Swedish Police Authority’s scope to deny a permit application to hold a public gathering.@@@We must stand together to combat all forms of racism, intolerance and hatred.@@@Russia’s illegal war of aggression against Ukraine jeopardizes nuclear safety and security in Ukraine and beyond.@@@Russia’s threats to use nuclear weapons, declared readiness to conduct a nuclear test and announcement about deploying nuclear weapons in Belarus are all deeply irresponsible.@@@The expansion of nuclear arsenals without transparency, the abandonment of arms control agreements and the threats to engage in regional proliferation give cause for serious concern.@@@Multilateralism is our best chance to address those challenges and realize the objectives enshrined in the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.@@@All States must help to drive that progress.@@@Our geographies are linked, and our challenges shared.@@@And as much as our challenges are shared, so too are our opportunities.@@@We must strive to fulfil them together.@@@This is not the first time that the world has faced numerous and difficult challenges.@@@Those challenges will demand a lot from us: extensive collaboration, pragmatism, hard work, compromises and shared determination.@@@History shows us that dark times can be overcome.@@@Next year’s Summit for the Future provides us with the opportunity to confirm our commitment to the United Nations Charter and a rules- based international order as we tackle the challenges ahead.@@@Succeeding generations should, to a greater extent, be able to live in security, enjoy human rights and live in prosperous societies.@@@It is our job and our responsibility to make that happen.@@@I congratulate His Excellency Mr. Dennis Francis on assuming the 
presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session and thank the previous President.@@@His Excellency Mr. Csaba Korosi, for his hard work over the past year.@@@The world continue s to face a multitude of challenge s that transcend boundaries.@@@From deteriorating climate trends to deep-rooted poverty, rising tensions and ravaging pandemics, the challenges plague us all, regardless of our background or location, and require bold and concerted action.@@@International politics is becoming increasingly fragmented, leading to the division and erosion of multilateralism.@@@The growing trend to intolerance and discrimination, in particular Islamophobia and the alarming surge in hate speech, is disturbing.@@@In order to curb that challenge through our centuries-old tradition of diversity and multiculturalism.@@@Azerbaijan firmly believes in fostering dialogue, mutual understanding and respect among different cultures and religions.@@@The Government of Azerbaijan has consistently promoted intercultural and interfaith dialogue through significant global initiatives such as the Baku process and the Peace4Culture Global Call.@@@Amid the growing challenges, it will be vital for the United Nations to continue to galvanize international solidarity and cooperation.@@@Our Organization has a mandate to ensure that every nation has an equal voice and is treated on the same footing.@@@The purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations are binding worldwide and must be applied consistently, not selectively.@@@Azerbaijan advocates for a reinvigorated and reformed multilateral system with the United Nations at its core, underpinned by strict adherence to the norms and principles of international law and their non-selective application.@@@We look forward to the Summit of the Future as an opportunity to reinvigorate global action and reflect on our collective commitment to the Charter and multilateralism.@@@In its national capacity and as the current Chair of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries (NAM).@@@Azerbaijan has continued to contribute to peace, security and the global sustainable development agenda, and has spared no effort to promote international solidarity and multilateralism.@@@Since the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.@@@Azerbaijan has been at the forefront in advancing a number of global initiatives to overcome that challenge.@@@The lingering effects of the pandemic have created a pressing need for us to redouble our global cooperation and solidarity efforts, anchored in high-level political engagement and collaboration involving all vital stakeholders.@@@International cooperation and political engagement require the involvement of various stakeholders, including women and young people.@@@Azerbaijan has made that a key focus of its NAM chairmanship through the foundation of the NAM Youth Organization, with a permanent secretariat in Baku, in line with the Shusha Accords, and by initiating the establishment of a NAM platform for women.@@@Azerbaijan also spearheaded the foundation of the NAM Parliamentary Network.@@@We must strengthen our joint efforts to tackle the pandemic’s consequences and consolidate efforts for the global recovery from COVID-19.@@@In the light of that.@@@President Aliyev of Azerbaijan initiated the establishment of a United Nations high- level panel on the post-pandemic global recovery.@@@In March 2023 we hosted the Summit of the NAM Contact Group in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, at which, in his capacity as NAM Chair, our President declared the establishment of two global calls to support the post-pandemic recovery of Africa and small island developing States.@@@As the first donor.@@@Azerbaijan announced that it would allocate funds to both calls.@@@Since 2020.@@@Azerbaijan has provided humanitarian, economic and technical assistance amounting to $300 million to more than 130 nations.@@@As we approach the midpoint of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, many parts of the world are struggling to achieve our shared vision of the future.@@@It is imperative that we work to confront those challenges in concert.@@@Azerbaijan has been a passionate supporter of the universal promotion and implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals since their adoption.@@@We have been pursuing transformational changes by remodelling our economy and focusing on sustainability, inclusive growth, social justice and clean energy.@@@Azerbaijan’s gross domestic product (GDP) has tripled in less than two decades, and our poverty levels have fallen from 49 to 5 per cent.@@@Our external public debt is expected to be approximately 10 per cent of GDP for 2023, one of the lowest in the world.@@@Achieving a clean environment and green growth is one of the five priority areas of our new national development strategy.@@@Azerbaijan has voluntarily pledged to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions by up to 40 per cent by 2050 and to establish a green-energy zone in its Garabagh and East Zangazur regions.@@@Azerbaijan’s role in global energy security has further expanded from that of a traditional crude-oil 
supplier to that of a reliable natural-gas provider.@@@With the completion of the Southern Gas Corridor, the biggest infrastructure project in Europe.@@@Azerbaijan is now supplying natural gas to five more European countries.@@@At a time when European energy security is facing unprecedented challenges, seven countries in Europe are currently receiving natural gas from Azerbaijan, and that number will increase to 10 in the near future.@@@Our projected increase in renewable electricity production will enable us to become an exporter of green electricity to European countries through the landmark trans-regional Black Sea submarine cable project that Azerbaijan has embarked on with partner countries.@@@Azerbaijan is also a key player in the development of trans-regional connectivity projects.@@@In 2022 we increased transit flow by 70 per cent by boosting investments in transportation infrastructure and widening cooperation with our regional partners.@@@Despite the unprecedented suffering, deprivation and devastation that the people of Azerbaijan were subjected to during Armenia’s 30-year military occupation.@@@Azerbaijan initiated a normalization agenda and offered peace to Armenia, based on equal and reciprocal respect for the legitimate interests of both sides through mutual recognition of and respect for each other’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and the inviolability of their borders.@@@In the past few months, thanks to the concerted efforts of international partners, the negotiations have intensified and yielded limited, but promising, results.@@@But we are seeing Armenia repeat its past patterns by pretending to participate in talks, backtracking on previously undertaken commitments at the last minute and committing political, military, and other provocations at every stage of the negotiations so as to avoid taking concrete steps.@@@As a result, the efforts for durable peace between Azerbaijan and Armenia have once again become hostage to Armenia’s policy of revanchism.@@@Since November 2020, armed formations, numbering more than 10.000 and equipped with heavy offensive weaponry, have been maintained by Armenia for almost three years on Azerbaijan’s sovereign soil, including by abusing the Lachin corridor in an attempt to fuel separatism.@@@While engaging in negotiations during this period, we have consistently drawn the attention of all international actors involved in the normalization process and of the wider international community to the serious threat posed by Armenia’s unwillingness to fulfil its commitments, and we have called for a peaceful solution.@@@While our legitimate and fact-based concerns were acknowledged behind closed doors, that was not translated into real steps and targeted public messages persuading Armenia to honour its commitments.@@@Armenia therefore felt emboldened and once again bought into the delusion that it would be better off by opting for a status quo based on an illegal military presence and line-of-contact logic in the sovereign territory of Azerbaijan.@@@It also proceeded to ignite tension through a global campaign of manipulation and disinformation targeting Azerbaijan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and blatantly interfering in its internal affairs.@@@For months now Armenia has mobilized every available resource for its manipulation campaign, based on fabricated allegations of blockade, humanitarian crisis or ethnic cleansing.@@@To that end.@@@Armenia recklessly politicized and essentially obstructed the delivery of goods to the Garabagh region of Azerbaijan in service of its separatist agenda and blocked the consistent efforts of several international actors to find a legitimate and practical solution through dialogue.@@@On 18 September, a simultaneous delivery of humanitarian goods through Aghdam and Lachin — which was offered by Azerbaijan months ago and positively received by all the international actors involved — was finally conducted by the International Committee of the Red Cross, as Armenia was forced to withdraw its weeks-long obstructions.@@@Azerbaijan, like the broader international community, welcomed that development, hoping it would finally lead to de-escalation on the ground and pave the way for restoring the focus on pressing issues pertinent to inter-State normalization.@@@However.@@@Armenia failed to meet those expectations yet again, resorting instead to military provocation in an attempt to continue its blame game against Azerbaijan.@@@As a result, one day later, mines planted by an Armenian sabotage group led to the tragic death of six Azerbaijani citizens — two civilians and four police officers — in two separate explosions.@@@Another six police officers were seriously injured.@@@In response.@@@Azerbaijan launched local counterterrorism measures to neutralize the illegal armed formations in order to preserve its sovereignty and territorial integrity and protect the safety and security of its residents.@@@The measures were limited, proportionate and aimed exclusively at neutralizing legitimate military targets by using high-precision ammunition, in full compliance with the norms of humanitarian law.@@@Every possible measure was taken to avoid collateral 
damage.@@@In less than 24 hours, the horrific scale of the illegal militarization of Azerbaijan’s territories became clear, with the neutralization of more than 90 military outposts.@@@20 combat vehicles.@@@40 artillery pieces.@@@30 mortars, six electromagnetic warfare systems and two anti-aircraft missile systems.@@@More evidence is being collected now as the disarmament efforts continue on the ground.@@@No sovereign State would tolerate an illegal military presence on its soil, and Azerbaijan is no exception.@@@Our counter-terror measures achieved the goals that had been set.@@@Armenia and its subordinate illegal regime were forced to agree to disarm, dismantle all illegal structures and withdraw from Azerbaijan.@@@The reason that this did not happen peacefully lies in Armenia’s brazen aggressiveness and a lack of adequate action on the part of the third-party facilitators involved.@@@Having concluded our counter-terror measures, we have now embarked on the practical implementation of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration efforts on the ground.@@@The long-overdue meeting of a special representative of the Government of Azerbaijan with representatives of Armenian residents finally took place on 21 September in the city of Yevlakh.@@@The dialogue will continue as a format for directly discussing the Government’s reintegration plans and addressing issues related to restoring and operating infrastructure and the delivery of humanitarian goods and public services.@@@The central Government institutions have begun rapidly carrying out the necessary humanitarian support measures, and we have mobilized every effort to address the immediate needs of the local civilians.@@@On that point.@@@I want to reiterate that Azerbaijan is determined to reintegrate the ethnic Armenian residents of the Garabagh region as equal citizens.@@@The Constitution, the national legislation of Azerbaijan and the international commitments we have undertaken provide a solid basis for that.@@@Despite all the serious challenges created by Armenia’s destructive position.@@@Azerbaijan once again reaffirms its readiness for a genuine dialogue and negotiations with Armenia on the basis of equal and reciprocal respect for each other’s legitimate interests.@@@We maintain a firm belief that there is a historic opportunity for Azerbaijan and Armenia to establish good-neighbourly relations and coexist side by side in peace as two sovereign States within their internationally recognized borders.@@@It is high time to seize that opportunity.@@@To that end, it is essential for Armenia to finally realize that rejecting the offer of a just and equal peace — based on its hopes of better conditions for achieving its revanchist aims in future — is not viable and has no chance of succeeding.@@@The Armenian leadership’s verbal statements on recognizing the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Azerbaijan, including the Garabagh region, must be translated into tangible steps.@@@It will be critical to ensure meaningful engagement by international actors that are able and willing to support Azerbaijan and Armenia in that endeavour in a fair, impartial and unbiased manner.@@@It is equally important for all who are unable to be honest brokers to refrain from projecting their short-sighted agendas onto the process.@@@Every effort should be made to build on the progress already achieved and finalize the normalization process without further delay.@@@Azerbaijan is determined and committed to promoting the normalization agenda.@@@Along with the interstate process of normalization with Armenia.@@@Azerbaijan has launched large-scale rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts to eliminate the harsh consequences of the 30 years of military occupation of our territories, aimed at safeguarding the right of hundreds of thousands of Azerbaijanis to eventually exercise their violated right to a safe and dignified return.@@@Thanks to the Government’s tireless efforts, life is now returning to areas that experienced unprecedented vandalism in the 30 years of Armenian military occupation.@@@The first groups of displaced families have already returned to their places of origin.@@@Regrettably, the massive contamination of Azerbaijan’s territory with landmines and other explosive devices remains a significant obstacle to the smooth progress of rehabilitation and reconstruction and is a threat to the people returning home after three decades of displacement.@@@Armenia’s refusal to share all of its maps of mined areas, and its continued planting of landmines, booby traps and other explosives even after its declared cessation of all military activities, are further aggravating the situation and increasing the human toll.@@@Since November 2020.@@@315 individuals have fallen victim to landmines planted by Armenia.@@@Some mines were transferred to and planted in Azerbaijani territory after the signing of the trilateral statement.@@@Given the ongoing landmine problem in Azerbaijan and the challenges facing our national agencies in addressing it, we urgently need greater international support in strengthening our humanitarian mine-action capacity, which would not only aid in demining efforts 
but also contribute to the global campaign against landmines and demonstrate a commitment to peace and cooperation in the region.@@@Ensuring justice for serious war crimes and crimes against humanity is vital to healing the wounds of the past conflict.@@@In addition to upholding the rights and interests of the victims, accountability and redress are also critical prerequisites on the path to genuine post-conflict normalization and reconciliation.@@@Over more than 30 years of aggression and occupation.@@@Armenia desecrated and destroyed Azerbaijani cultural heritage, including numerous monuments of world and national importance, mosques, temples, mausoleums, museums, art galleries, archaeological sites and libraries.@@@The fate of almost 4.000 citizens of Azerbaijan, including 719 civilians who went missing during the conflict, remains unknown.@@@Although several mass graves have been discovered in the liberated territories, exposing the wilful killing of Azerbaijani civilians and other persons protected under international humanitarian law.@@@Armenia refuses to clarify the whereabouts of missing persons.@@@Resolving that issue is essential not only in terms of accountability and the rights of the victims and their families, but also for post-conflict reconciliation and normalization.@@@Between 1987 and 1991.@@@Armenia forcibly expelled some 300.000 Azerbaijanis from their ancestral homeland in a blatant violation of international law.@@@All Azerbaijani settlements and place names in Armenia were renamed, and our historical and cultural heritage was deliberately vandalized and destroyed.@@@Despite repeated calls by the western Azerbaijan community for launching a dialogue and ensuring a safe and dignified return to their homeland, the Government of Armenia denied them the exercise of their fundamental right to return, as enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and other important international acts.@@@While remaining committed to its international obligations and open to constructive dialogue.@@@Azerbaijan will not tolerate violations of international law and will continue taking appropriate steps at the international level.@@@In particular.@@@Azerbaijan’s initiation of judicial proceedings to hold Armenia accountable for grave violations of international human rights law, and to bring to justice those responsible for such crimes, is a significant step towards achieving accountability.@@@Azerbaijan is fully committed to the objectives of a peaceful, secure, stable and prosperous South Caucasus.@@@As a responsible actor, we will continue our efforts to advance post-conflict peace-building, reintegration and peaceful coexistence, while sparing no effort in all relevant areas, whether those are post-COVID-19 recovery, the global development agenda or energy security.@@@The challenges that we face today require a renewed commitment to international cooperation and solidarity.@@@It is only through joint efforts that we can overcome the complex challenges of the present and future to build a brighter future for ourselves and for generations to come.@@@When human catastrophes seem beyond description, we turn to the appalling statistics.@@@This year, around the world, more than 345 million people face food insecurity, daily hunger or starvation.@@@Among the most vulnerable are 108 million refugees, people who have been forcibly displaced from their homes and ways of life.@@@And 40 per cent of those refugees are children, the most defenceless of all.@@@Yet the numbers cannot really convey the tragedy or the failure.@@@Refugees are our brothers and sisters.@@@They look to our countries to help end the crises that have driven them from home.@@@Refugees are mothers, fathers and grandparents, who have made perilous journeys to save their families.@@@They are young people with big dreams and little children who deserve the chance to dream big.@@@They depend on the international community for their survival, and multiple United Nations agencies provide vital services to help meet the need.@@@But in recent months, one by one, those agencies have been delivering difficult news.@@@A severe shortfall in international funds has forced them to cut support.@@@Is that what we have come to?@@@Is the international community going to watch as refugee families find themselves forced to send their children to work instead of school?@@@In Jordan, where refugees make up more than one third of our population of 11 million, cuts have already thrown the lives of hundreds of thousands of refugees into uncertainty.@@@The impact of such humanitarian shortfalls is never limited to a country or region.@@@Fear and want bring on sharp increases in the number of refugees fleeing to Europe and beyond on journeys that too often end in tragedy.@@@Jordanians are serious about our duty to those in need.@@@We have done everything we can to secure a dignified life for refugees.@@@Nearly half of the almost 1.4 million Syrians whom we host are under 18 years of age.@@@For many of them.@@@Jordan is the only place they have ever known.@@@More than 230.000 Syrian children have been born in Jordan since 2011.@@@We are sharing precious resources to help them meet basic needs — food, energy and especially water.@@@We are among the water-poorest countries in the world, even as our water supplies face extraordinary demand.@@@And we face those pressures just when another crisis has hit our region: climate change, with its destructive heat waves, drought and flooding.@@@And to meet the refugee burden, we have been carefully managing to combine our limited resources with essential support from the international community, because the responsibility to act falls on everyone’s shoulders and the world cannot afford to walk away and leave a lost generation behind.@@@But today Jordan’s capacity to deliver necessary services to refugees has surpassed our limits.@@@The Syrian refugees’ future is in their country, not in host countries.@@@But until they are able to return, we must all do right by them.@@@And the fact is that refugees are far from returning.@@@On the contrary, more Syrians are likely to leave their country as the crisis persists.@@@And Jordan will not have the ability or the resources to host and care for more.@@@We must find a political solution that is consistent with Security Council resolution 2254 (2015) and the step-for-step approach, which offers a path forward.@@@Proposed by Jordan as the basis for engagement with the Syrian Government and coordinated with the United Nations, that approach sets out a road map for incrementally resolving the crisis and dealing with all its consequences.@@@Until then, we will protect our country against any future threats that the crisis could pose to our national security.@@@Jordan’s case is a microcosm of our entire region.@@@For all our peoples’ immense potential, repeated crises have held back the promise of greater development and prosperity.@@@Our region is a focal point, where some of the most urgent global challenges are converging.@@@How will our world respond?@@@Will we come together in global solidarity to get to the root of the problem — the conflicts and crises that destroy life and hope?@@@Will we work as one to rebuild the lost trust in international action and help those in want?@@@Our region will continue to suffer until the world helps lift the shadow of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, the central issue in the Middle East.@@@No architecture for regional security and development can stand over the burning ashes of that conflict.@@@But seven and a half decades on, it still smoulders.@@@Where are we going?@@@Without clarity on where the future of the Palestinians lies, it will be impossible to converge on a political solution to the conflict.@@@Five million Palestinians live under occupation — no civil rights, no freedom of mobility, no say in their own lives.@@@Yet every United Nations resolution since the beginning of the conflict recognizes the equal right of the Palestinian people to a future of peace, dignity and hope.@@@That is the heart of a two-State solution — the only path to comprehensive, lasting peace.@@@We can see the Israeli people actively defending and engaging in the expression of their national identity.@@@Yet the Palestinian people are deprived of that same right to express and fulfil their own national identity.@@@The basic requirement for that right is the establishment of their own independent and viable State on the 4 June 1967 lines, with East Jerusalem as its capital, living alongside Israel in peace, security and prosperity.@@@Delaying justice and peace has brought endless cycles of violence — 2023 has been the deadliest for the Palestinian people in the past 15 years.@@@How can people trust in global justice while settlement-building, land confiscations and home demolitions continue?@@@Where is the global solidarity to make United Nations resolutions believable for people in need of our help?@@@Jerusalem is a flashpoint of global concern.@@@Under the Hashemite custodianship of Islamic and Christian holy sites.@@@Jordan remains committed to safeguarding the city’s identity.@@@But we all share the responsibility of preserving Jerusalem as the city of faith and peace for Islam.@@@Christianity and Judaism.@@@And we must not abandon Palestinian refugees to the forces of despair.@@@Sustainable funding is urgently needed by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, which provides vital relief, education and health services to millions of Palestinian refugees.@@@It is essential to protecting families, keeping communities stable and preparing young people for productive lives.@@@We must protect young Palestinians from extremists who prey on their frustrations and hopelessness by making sure that they continue to learn at schools under the blue flag of the United Nations, because the alternative will be the black flags of terror, hate and extremism.@@@We come together here as partners to deal with our challenges and shape a better future.@@@We speak here for our people.@@@We speak for families and the younger generations.@@@We speak for victims of conflict, displacement, hunger, climate-change disasters and more.@@@They are not mere statistics.@@@They are our fellow human beings, sharing our world.@@@Only by restoring trust, only by acting in solidarity will we create the future that all our peoples desire and deserve.@@@We cannot allow a lost generation on our watch.@@@I join previous speakers in extending my sincere congratulations to Mr. Francis on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session.@@@He can count on my delegation’s full support as he steers the work of this body.@@@I could not agree more with him that the multilateral system needs to rebuild trust and reignite global solidarity to accelerate action on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in order to realize peace, prosperity, progress and sustainability.@@@As we convene this week, the world is in the age of a polycrisis, facing a plethora of persisting global challenges, among them the war in Ukraine, its associated geopolitical tensions, the impact on the global economy, the challenges related to climate change and the lingering effects of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.@@@Of critical importance is the distressing reality that the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals is off-track.@@@According to The Sustainable Development Goals Report 2023: Special Edition, half of the targets of the SDGs are experiencing inadequate progress, while 30 per cent of the targets have come to a halt.@@@The lack of progress is exacerbated by the multifaceted global crisis compounding the already dire situation in which we find ourselves.@@@Illustratively, whereas SDG 5 expresses the need for gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls and picks representation in positions of power and leadership as one of the indicators, the United Nations has not done badly in that regard except for the Secretary-General position.@@@Would participants not agree with me that now is the time to have a female Secretary-General?@@@The gravity of the challenges faced by the SDGs demands that we transcend the business-as-usual approach to addressing them.@@@That will require a robust political commitment from all of us.@@@It is therefore imperative for the United Nations system, international financiers, the private sector and civil society to forge a collective front and refocus our efforts to swiftly propel the SDGs back on track.@@@To that end, the recent Sustainable Development Goals Summit and its Political Declaration could not have come at a better time.@@@Over the past few years, we have witnessed, and continue to endure, the profound and devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.@@@The consequences have been felt across nations, but the extent of its devastation has greatly varied depending on factors such as the level of development and the geographical location.@@@Whether one resides in the global South or North, a landlocked developing country (LLDC) or a small island developing State, those distinctions have played a crucial role in determining the severity of the pandemic’s effects.@@@It is therefore imperative that we wholeheartedly embrace the ongoing discussions regarding pandemic prevention, preparedness and response.@@@Botswana’s key priority in such discussions is to ensure an international instrument that addresses equity during a pandemic.@@@To that end, the main issues to be addressed from that perspective include timely and equitable access and the sharing of benefits; the strengthening of regulations to ensure that developed countries and those with resources do not hoard medical products during a pandemic; building capacity for stronger health systems; investment in research and development to build up the local and regional manufacturing of vaccines, including the sharing of intellectual property; and establishing sustainable, predictable and flexible financing mechanisms.@@@I am pleased to inform the General Assembly that Botswana is making its contribution to building capacity to manufacture vaccines for both humans and animals.@@@We have made remarkable progress in terms of HIV diagnosis and, on 28 August, our National HIV Reference Laboratory was designated a World Health Organization collaborating centre of excellence.@@@That epitomized, in part, the crowning of our National Laboratory’s competence and success in carrying out genomic sequencing at levels equivalent to those of the best, as demonstrated by being the first to discover the Omicron variant.@@@By the time that such discussions reach their conclusion, it is essential that we establish robust systems that leave no room for the repetition of such a calamity, ensuring that the survival and well-being of our people are never again contingent upon their location in the global South or North.@@@More important, our hope is that the resultant of the discussions will culminate in a treaty.@@@Climate change remains an urgent and critical challenge of our time, posing a huge threat to the existence of our planet.@@@It is alarming that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change recently reported record-high global greenhouse-gas emissions, which are at the highest level and which continue to surge.@@@To effectively address climate change, it is crucial that we prioritize international cooperation and partnerships.@@@Such a global effort requires a comprehensive approach that goes beyond reducing emissions, encompassing various aspects of our lives, be it energy production, agriculture, transportation or industry.@@@Our efforts must also include accelerating the uptake of renewable energy sources and investing in clean technologies.@@@That necessitates sufficient funding to support mitigation and adaptation, particularly for developing countries.@@@In that context, we endorse the appeal for developed countries to fulfil their pledge to provide $100 billion annually in climate financing to developing countries.@@@That also includes fully replenishing the Green Climate Fund.@@@My Government welcomes the Secretary-General’s Acceleration Agenda, which urges the fast-tracking of climate action in all countries and sectors.@@@It is imperative that both developed and developing countries comply with their targets.@@@As for Botswana, we reaffirm our commitment to achieving a 15 per cent reduction in carbon emissions by 2030.@@@It has been more than a year since the beginning of the Russia-Ukraine war.@@@The war’s destructive consequences have been experienced not only in the region but also globally, as the international economy has suffered from the food and energy crisis.@@@Botswana strongly urges an immediate cessation of hostilities and advocates for a diplomatic resolution to the conflict.@@@In that regard.@@@Botswana welcomes the recent engagement among African.@@@Russian and Ukrainian leaders, and we hope that such efforts, along with similar initiatives elsewhere, will encourage the conflicting parties to return to the negotiation table.@@@While we work on resolving active conflicts, we must step up action in mitigating all threats to international peace and security by reaffirming and observing the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, international law and other obligations.@@@That also includes a commitment to obligations concerning, among other things, nuclear disarmament, nuclear non-proliferation, arms control and weapons of mass destruction.@@@Botswana shares a deep concern regarding the persistent conflicts and destabilization of legitimate Governments across the African continent.@@@The negation of constitutionalism, as evidenced by overthrows of Governments, which seem to be having a contagion effect, should be shunned with the greatest disdain.@@@Equally, the deprivation of people from self- determination, albeit repugnant, continues unabated.@@@It is of the utmost importance that the Secretary- General collaborate closely with the African Union and subregional organizations to prioritize and actively engage to foster peace and stability in Africa.@@@I firmly believe that the attainment of lasting peace in Africa can pave the way for a more prosperous and harmonious continent, where the aspirations and well-being of African people can thrive.@@@Next year marks the conclusion of the Vienna Programme of Action for Landlocked Developing Countries for the Decade 2014-2024, followed by the third United Nations Conference on Landlocked Developing Countries, scheduled to be held in Kigali in June 2024.@@@The challenges faced by LLDCs have 
been extensively documented, and the ongoing global crises have inflicted severe damage on their economies.@@@Unfortunately, the progress achieved in implementing the Vienna Programme of Action has been eroded by such crises, resulting in persistently high poverty levels in LLDCs, which averaged 23 per cent as of 2022.@@@Those countries continue to suffer from marginalization in global trade due to exorbitant trade costs, underscoring the urgent need for infrastructure development and maintenance to address geographical and structural obstacles and capitalize on their untapped potential.@@@The forthcoming programme presents a valuable opportunity to rally greater global support and foster multi-stakeholder partnerships.@@@Consequently, we must prioritize the formulation of new and tangible priorities aimed at bolstering infrastructure in LLDCs, with a particular emphasis on the transit transportation, information and communication technology and energy sectors.@@@I therefore urge the Secretary- General, development partners, international financial institutions, the private sector and civil society to unite in support of the upcoming conference.@@@It is essential that we not only strive for its success, but also forge a new programme of action that is attuned to the pressing challenges confronting LLDCs.@@@That comprehensive programme must provide the necessary tools and resources to enable such countries to attain their SDG objectives.@@@To conclude.@@@I want to re-emphasize that merely acknowledging global problems without taking substantive measures will not solve them.@@@We require greater action.@@@The time for urgent action to revitalize the United Nations system, ensuring that it is fit for purpose, is now.@@@First of all.@@@I would like to congratulate Mr. Dennis Francis of Trinidad and Tobago on assuming the post of President of the General Assembly.@@@I assure him of Latvia’s full cooperation along the way.@@@The topic of this year’s general debate invites us to focus on rebuilding trust and global solidarity.@@@Rooted in the Charter of the United Nations, both concepts are crucial for effective multilateralism.@@@Today I would like to highlight the following points.@@@We are at a transformative moment for the global order.@@@Russia’s unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine continues to challenge the world in many ways.@@@It is a test for the rules-based multilateral system.@@@The Russian Federation’s brutal invasion of its neighbour runs counter to the fundamental United Nations principles of refraining from the use of force against the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of States.@@@The blatant breach of those principles undermines the entire international system, especially if the aggressor 
is a nuclear-weapon State and a permanent member of the Security Council.@@@It is not a dispute between two neighbouring countries; Russia’s attack was unprovoked.@@@Russia is trying to redraw international borders by force to restore its former sphere of influence.@@@In 2008 and 2014, the international community made a grave mistake by not responding to Russia’s aggression against Georgia and the illegal annexation of Crimea.@@@It sent the wrong message to Russia, allowing its aggressive imperial ambitions to advance.@@@We are now seeing the consequences.@@@Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a reminder of the struggle of a colonial empire to keep its territories.@@@Ukraine is not Russia.@@@It never was and never will be.@@@Having experienced 50 years of Soviet occupation.@@@Latvia knows the value of freedom and independence, like so many countries in other regions.@@@The international community must stand together firmly against Russia’s attack, based on the principles and norms of international law.@@@Respect for the United Nations Charter is in the vital interest of all States.@@@The outcome of the war will determine global security for years to come.@@@Latvia condemns in the strongest possible terms Russia’s ongoing aggression against Ukraine, which has been enabled by Lukashenko’s regime in Belarus.@@@We cannot talk about restoring international trust until Russia ends the war and withdraws from Ukraine.@@@Russia must withdraw all its forces and military equipment from Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders.@@@Russia must stop its terror and atrocity crimes.@@@In response to those who call for a ceasefire and peaceful dialogue.@@@I would like to recall that only Ukraine can decide when to start peace negotiations.@@@Latvia supports Ukraine’s peace formula.@@@Sustainable peace must be based on Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.@@@I call on all Members of the United Nations to support those principles.@@@Ukraine has shown remarkable determination in exercising its right to self-defence against Russia’s aggression.@@@I urge the international community to continue providing all needed support to Ukraine and its people.@@@Latvia will support Ukraine for as long as it takes.@@@Our assistance to Ukraine has already exceeded 1.3 per cent of Latvia’s gross domestic product.@@@Together with the private sector and civil society, we have sent humanitarian aid to Ukrainian regions.@@@Latvia continues to give safe refuge to the Ukrainian people.@@@We provide rehabilitation to wounded Ukrainian soldiers and victims of sexual violence.@@@Comprehensive support for the Ukrainian people to rebuild their country will be required.@@@It is important to already start laying the ground for the reconstruction of Ukraine.@@@Even in times of war, the rules of international humanitarian law apply.@@@The evidence of Russia’s deliberate attacks on the civilian population and infrastructure in Ukraine is mounting.@@@Innocent civilians, including children, are being killed.@@@More than 11 million people have been forced to leave their homes.@@@The illegal adoption and forcible deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia is of serious concern.@@@We call on the United Nations to take a more active stance on the issue.@@@Latvia knows all too well the heavy toll that the deportations and acts of repression by the occupying regime have cost generations.@@@Russia must bear the full legal and financial responsibility for its aggression.@@@We must ensure full accountability for all crimes committed in Ukraine.@@@That means the responsibility of Russia as a State for violations of international law, as well as individual liability for the most serious international crimes.@@@I commend the steps taken by the International Criminal Court to investigate atrocity crimes in Ukraine.@@@Latvia has provided financial contributions to the Court, including to the Trust Fund for Victims.@@@We support other international mechanisms documenting and investigating Russia’s violations.@@@However, neither the International Criminal Court nor any other existing mechanism is able to exercise jurisdiction over the crime of aggression against Ukraine.@@@Every effort should be made to hold Russia’s leadership and military personnel accountable.@@@At stake is whether impunity or abiding by the international rule of law will prevail.@@@Latvia reiterates the need to establish a special international tribunal for the crime of aggression against Ukraine.@@@The creation of a tribunal under the auspices of the United Nations would provide the strongest international legitimacy.@@@I encourage other countries to support the proposal.@@@The Register of Damage Caused by the Aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, which was created by the Council of Europe, is an important step towards establishing a future international compensation mechanism.@@@As the current holder of the presidency of the Council of Europe.@@@Latvia launched the Register.@@@We hope that more countries beyond the members of the Council of Europe will join that important initiative.@@@By blocking Ukraine’s exports and destroying its agricultural sector.@@@Russia has disrupted grain deliveries worldwide; yet it claims to care about 
global food security.@@@There is no doubt that Russia is directly responsible for the suffering of people worldwide.@@@Increases in costs and food insecurity affect all regions.@@@The Black Sea Grain Initiative was paramount for global food security.@@@We condemn Russia’s unilateral termination of the Initiative.@@@Food and energy are instruments of Russia’s warfare, fuelled by disinformation.@@@Lies must be countered with truth and facts.@@@Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has caused shortages of food and fertilizer supplies; it was not the sanctions.@@@Sanctions do not block the export of mineral fertilizers or grain from Russia.@@@The truth is that Russia is benefiting from higher prices.@@@Access to food is a human right, and hunger must never be used as a political tool.@@@International efforts to facilitate Ukrainian exports for global food security must continue.@@@Latvia cooperates with the World Food Programme to improve food security worldwide.@@@I urge the United Nations to resolve the issue of the removal of the remaining Russian-owned fertilizer from Latvia’s territory so it can be delivered to countries in need as soon as possible.@@@The United Nations system must respond more effectively to humanitarian needs.@@@The concept of solidarity has defined the work of the United Nations since the birth of the Organization.@@@The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Summit, held two days ago, reaffirmed the importance of dialogue, cooperation and solidarity.@@@At the same time, the Summit acknowledged the stark reality of the fact that achieving the global Goals by 2030 will be very challenging for many countries.@@@International cooperation will be key.@@@The global SDG Index ranks Latvia fourteenth among Member States for overall achievement of the global Goals.@@@Latvia firmly believes that strengthening an innovative and eco-efficient economy, quality education and good governance will contribute to our development.@@@The participation of the non-governmental sector and of young people has become an integral part of our national decision-making processes.@@@In a spirit of solidarity.@@@Latvia’s development cooperation policy is becoming more global.@@@A notable part of our development support has been provided to Ukraine and countries of the European Eastern Partnership and Central Asia.@@@Latvia has now expanded its cooperation projects to countries in Africa, and we are ready to contribute to the promotion of peace, good governance, economic growth, digitalization and gender equality.@@@Latvia also recognizes the climate-induced challenges that small island developing States (SIDS) face.@@@Strengthening resilience remains at the core of SIDS sustainability, and Latvia is committed to contributing to the successful preparation of the United Nations SIDS conference next year, including financially.@@@We will continue to follow the evolving work of the International Law Commission on the legal aspects of sea level rise, and we are already engaged in international legal proceedings addressing the obligations of States regarding climate change.@@@Resilience to disinformation is another area where Latvia has meaningful experience.@@@We must address the issue of the accountability of actors in the information environment, including at the global level.@@@The United Nations is not a perfect institution.@@@Its inability to stop aggression or conflicts has often called its effectiveness into question.@@@Still, as our only truly global organization, it is at the core of the multilateral system uniting all sovereign States, and it is especially important for smaller countries such as my own.@@@The revitalization of the United Nations system and meaningful reforms of the Security Council are essential.@@@The paralysis of the Security Council resulting from abuse of the veto is a serious concern, which is why Latvia supports efforts to make the Security Council more transparent and accountable for its lack of action.@@@The power of the veto was created not as a privilege but as a responsibility.@@@Latvia supports a more just, equitable representation of the world’s regions on the Security Council, including for African countries and SIDS.@@@Latvia will continue to be a responsible and reliable partner involved in peacekeeping and peace-building efforts.@@@Our determination to protect the fundamental values of the Charter of the United Nations is guiding our candidacy for the Security Council elections in 2025.@@@This Organization is as effective as the collective will of its Member States, and it is in our hands to safeguard and improve it.@@@About one week ago.@@@I stood on the other side of the world in Viet Nam, on soil once bloody with war.@@@I met a small group of veterans — Americans and Vietnamese — whom I watched exchange personal artifacts from that war: identification cards and a diary.@@@It was deeply moving to see the reaction of the Vietnamese and American soldiers.@@@It was the culmination of 50 years of hard work on both sides to address the painful legacies of war and to choose to work together towards peace and a better future.@@@Nothing about that journey was inevitable.@@@For decades, it would have been unthinkable for an American President to stand in Hanoi alongside a Vietnamese leader and announce a mutual commitment to the highest level of a partnership between countries.@@@But it is a powerful reminder that our history need not dictate our future.@@@With concerted leadership and careful effort, adversaries can become partners.@@@Overwhelming challenges can be resolved.@@@And deep wounds can heal.@@@Let us never forget that.@@@When we choose to stand together and recognize the common hopes that bind all of humankind, we hold in our hands the power to bend that arc of history.@@@We gather once more at an inflection point in world history.@@@But the eyes of the world are upon all of us.@@@As President of the United States.@@@I understand the duty my country has to lead in this critical moment and to work with countries in every region, linking them in a common cause, and to join together with partners who share a common vision of the future of the world — in which our children do not go hungry and everyone has access to quality health care, workers are empowered and our environment is protected, entrepreneurs and innovators everywhere can access opportunity everywhere and conflicts are resolved peacefully and countries can chart their own course.@@@The United States seeks a more secure, more prosperous, more equitable world for all people because we know that all our futures are bound together.@@@Let me repeat that: we know that all our futures are bound together, and no nation can meet the challenges of today alone.@@@The generations that preceded us organized this body, the United Nations, and built international financial institutions and multilateral and regional bodies to help to take on the challenges of their time.@@@It was not always perfect, but working together, the world made some remarkable and undeniable progress and improved the lives of all people.@@@We avoided the renewal of global conflict, while lifting more than 1 billion 
people out of extreme poverty.@@@We, together, expanded access to education for millions of children.@@@We saved tens of millions of lives that would have otherwise been lost to preventable and treatable diseases such as measles, malaria and tuberculosis.@@@HIV/AIDS infections and deaths plummeted in no small part because of the work of the United States President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief in more than 55 countries, saving more than 25 million lives.@@@It is a profound testament to what we can achieve when we act together, when we take on tough challenges, and an admonition for all of us to urgently accelerate our progress so that no one is left behind because too many people are being left behind.@@@The institutions we built together at the end of the Second World War are an enduring bedrock of our progress, and the United States is committed to sustaining them.@@@This year, we are proud to rejoin UNESCO.@@@We also recognize that, to meet the new challenges, our decades-old institutions and approaches must be updated to keep peace in the world.@@@We have to bring in more leadership and capability, which exists everywhere, especially from the regions that not have not always been fully included.@@@We have to grapple with challenges that are more connected and more complex.@@@And we have to make sure we are delivering for people everywhere, not just people somewhere.@@@Simply put, twenty-first century results are badly needed to move us along.@@@That starts with the United Nations.@@@That starts right here in this Hall.@@@In my address to this body last year (see A/77/PV.6).@@@I announced that the United States would support expanding the Security Council by increasing the number of permanent and non-permanent members.@@@The United States has undertaken serious consultations with many Member States and will continue to do its part to push more reform efforts forward, look for points of common ground and make progress in the year ahead.@@@We need to be able to break the gridlock that too often stymies progress and blocks consensus in the Council.@@@We need more voices and more perspectives at the table.@@@The United Nations must continue to preserve peace, prevent conflict and alleviate human suffering.@@@We embrace nations stepping up to lead in new ways and to seek new breakthroughs on hard issues.@@@For example, on Haiti, the Caribbean Community has facilitated a dialogue among Haitian society.@@@I thank President Ruto of Kenya for his willingness to serve as the lead nation of a United Nations-backed security support mission.@@@I call on the Security Council to authorize that mission now.@@@The people of Haiti cannot wait much longer.@@@The United States is working across the board to make global institutions more responsive, more effective and more inclusive.@@@For example, we have taken significant steps to reform and scale up the World Bank, expanding its financing to low- and middle-income countries so it can help to boost progress towards meeting the Sustainable Development Goals and better address interconnected challenges such as climate change and fragility.@@@Under the new President of the World Bank, change is already taking root.@@@Last month.@@@I asked the United States Congress for additional funds to expand World Bank financing by $25 billion.@@@At the Group of 20 (G20), we rallied the major economies of the world to mobilize even more funding.@@@Collectively, we can deliver a transformational boost to World Bank lending.@@@And because the multilateral development banks are among the best tools we have for mobilizing transparent high- quality investment in developing countries, reforming those institutions can be a game-changer.@@@Similarly, we proposed making sure developing countries have a strong voice and representation at the International Monetary Fund.@@@We are going to continue our efforts to reform the World Trade Organization and preserve competition, openness, transparency and the rule of law, while at the same time equipping it to better tackle modern-day imperatives such as driving a clean energy transition, protecting workers and promoting inclusive and sustainable growth.@@@And this month, we strengthened the G20 as a vital forum, welcoming the African Union as a permanent member.@@@However, upgrading and strengthening our institutions is only half the picture.@@@We must also forge new partnerships and confront new challenges.@@@Emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence, hold both enormous potential and enormous peril.@@@We need to be sure they are used as tools of opportunity, not as weapons of oppression.@@@Together with leaders around the world, the United States is working to strengthen rules and policies so artificial intelligence technologies are safe before they are released to the public to make sure we govern the technology, not the other way around — having it govern us.@@@I am committed to working through this institution and other international bodies and directly with leaders around the world, including our competitors, to ensure 
we harness the power of artificial intelligence for good while protecting our citizens from its most profound risk.@@@It is going to take all of us.@@@I have been working at this for a while, as many Member States have.@@@It is going to take all of us to get this right.@@@In every region of the world, the United States is mobilizing strong alliances, versatile partnerships, common purpose and collective action to bring new approaches to our shared challenges.@@@In the western hemisphere, we united 21 nations in support of the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection, launching a region-wide approach to a region-wide challenge to better uphold laws and protect the rights of migrants.@@@In the Indo-Pacific, we have elevated our Quad partnership with India.@@@Japan and Australia to deliver concrete progress for the people of the region on everything from vaccines to maritime security.@@@Just yesterday, after two consultations in diplomacy, the United States brought together dozens of nations across four continents to establish a new partnership for Atlantic cooperation, so that the coastal Atlantic countries can better cooperate on science, technology, environmental protection and sustainable economic development.@@@We brought together nearly 100 countries in a global coalition to counter fentanyl and synthetic drugs to reduce the human cost of that affliction, and it is real.@@@As the nature of the terrorist threats evolves and the geography expands to new places, we are working with our partners to bring capabilities to bear, to disrupt plotting, degrade networks and protect all our people.@@@Additionally, we convened the Summit for Democracy to strengthen democratic institutions, root out corruption and reject political violence.@@@In this moment, in which democratically elected Governments have been toppled in quick succession in West and Central Africa, we are reminded that this work is as urgent and important as ever.@@@We stand with the African Union, the Economic Community of West African States and other regional bodies to support constitutional rule.@@@We will not retreat on the values that make us strong.@@@We will defend democracy — our best tool to meet the challenge that we face around the world.@@@And we are working to show how democracy can deliver in ways that matter to people’s lives.@@@The Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment addresses the enormous need and opportunity for infrastructure investment in low- and middle-income countries, particularly in Africa.@@@Latin America and South-East Asia, through strategic targeted public investments.@@@We can unlock enormous amounts of private sector financing.@@@The Group of Seven has pledged to work with parties to collectively mobilize $600 billion in infrastructure financing by 2027.@@@The United States has already mobilized more than $30 billion to date.@@@We are creating a race to the top, with projects that have high standards for workers, the environment and intellectual property, while avoiding the trap of unsustainable debt.@@@We are focusing on economic corridors that will maximize the impact of our collective investments and deliver consequential results across multiple countries and multiple sectors.@@@For example, the Lobito corridor will extend across Africa — from the western port of Angola, to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to Zambia—boosting regional connectivity and strengthening commerce and food security in Africa.@@@Similarly, the groundbreaking effort we announced at the G20 to connect India to Europe through the United Arab Emirates.@@@Saudi Arabia.@@@Jordan and Israel will spur opportunities for investment across two continents.@@@That is part of our effort to build a more sustainable, integrated Middle East.@@@It demonstrates how Israel’s greater normalization and economic connection with its neighbours is delivering positive and practical impacts, even as we continue to work tirelessly to support a just and lasting peace between the Israelis and Palestinians, with two States for two peoples.@@@Now let me be clear — none of these partnerships are about containing any country; they are about a positive vision for our shared future.@@@When it comes to China.@@@I want to be clear and consistent.@@@We seek to responsibly manage the competition between our countries so that it does not tip into conflict.@@@As I have said before, we are for de-risking, not decoupling with China.@@@We will push back on aggression and intimidation and defend the rules of the road — from freedom of navigation to overflight, to a level economic playing field, which have helped safeguard security and prosperity for decades — but we also stand ready to work together with China on issues where progress hinges on our common efforts.@@@Nowhere is that more critical than the accelerating climate crisis.@@@We see it everywhere —record-breaking heat waves in the United States and China, wildfires ravaging North America and southern Europe, a fifth year of drought in the Horn of Africa and tragic flooding in Libya that has killed many thousands of people.@@@My heart goes out to the people of Libya.@@@Together, those snapshots tell an urgent story of what awaits us if we fail to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and do not begin to climate-proof the world.@@@From day one, my United States Administration has treated this crisis as an existential threat, from the moment we took office — not for us only, but for all of humankind.@@@Last year I signed into law in the United States the largest investment ever and anywhere in the history of the world — to combat the climate crisis and help move the global economy towards a clean energy future.@@@We are also working with the Congress to quadruple our climate financing in order to help developing countries reach their climate goals and adapt to climate impacts.@@@And this year, the world is on track to meet the climate finance pledge made, collectively, under the Paris Agreement — to raise $100 billion.@@@But we need more investment from the public and private sector alike, especially in places that have contributed so little to global emissions, but face some of the worst effects of climate change, like the Pacific Islands.@@@The United States is working directly with the Pacific Island Forum to help those nations adapt and build resilience to the climate impact, even as we lead the effort to build innovative new partnerships that attack the global challenges from all sides.@@@Those range from the First Movers Coalition, which is mobilizing billions of dollars in private sector commitments to create a market demand for green products in carbon-intense sectors like concrete, shipping, aviation and trucking; to the Agricultural Innovation Mission for Climate, which is bringing farmers into the climate solution and making our food supply more resilient to climate shocks; to the Global Methane Pledge, now endorsed by more than 150 countries, which expands our focus beyond our carbon emission targets to reduce the potential greenhouse gases in our atmosphere by 30 per cent in this decade.@@@It is all within our capacity.@@@We need to bring that same commitment, urgency and ambition as we work together to meet the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.@@@Those Goals were adopted at the United Nations in 2015 (resolution 70/1) as a road map for improving lives around the world.@@@But the hard truth is that for decades of progress, the world has lost ground these past years, in the wake of the coronavirus disease pandemic, conflicts and other crises.@@@The United States is committing to doing its part to get us back on track.@@@All told, in the first two years of my Administration, the United States has invested more than $100 billion to drive development progress and bolster food security, expanding access to education worldwide, strengthening health-care systems and fighting disease, and we have helped mobilize billions more in private sector investments.@@@But to accelerate our forward progress on the Sustainable Development Goals, we all have to do more.@@@We need to build new partnerships that change the way we tackle this challenge in order to unlock trillions of additional financing for development, drawing on all sources.@@@We need to fill the gaps and address the failures of our existing system, exposed by the pandemic.@@@We need to ensure that women and girls benefit fully from our progress.@@@We must also do more to grapple with the debt that holds back so many lows- and middle-income countries.@@@When nations are forced to service unsustainable debt payments over the needs of their own people, it makes it harder for them to invest in their own futures.@@@And as we work together to recover from global shocks, the United States will also continue to be the largest single community donor country of humanitarian assistance at this moment of unparalleled need in the world.@@@Cooperation and partnership are the keys to progress on the challenges that affect us all, and the baseline for responsible global leadership.@@@We do not need to agree on everything to keep moving forward on issues like arms control, the cornerstone of international security.@@@After more than 50 years of progress under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.@@@Russia is shredding long-standing arms control agreements, including announcing the suspension of the New START Treaty and withdrawing from the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe.@@@I view it as irresponsible; it makes the entire world less safe.@@@The United States is going to continue to pursue good-faith efforts to reduce the threat of weapons of mass destruction and lead by example, no matter what else is happening in the world.@@@This year we safely destroyed the last chemical-munitions stockpile in the United States, fulfilling our commitment towards a world free of chemical weapons.@@@We condemn the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s continued violation of Security Council resolutions, but we are committed to diplomacy to bring about the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.@@@We are working with our partners to address Iran’s destabilizing activities, which threaten regional and global security, and remain steadfast in our commitment that Iran must never acquire a nuclear weapon.@@@Even as we evolve our institutions and drive creative new partnerships, let me be clear.@@@Certain principles in our international system are sacrosanct — sovereignty, territorial integrity and human rights.@@@Those are the core tenets of the Charter of the United Nations, the pillars for peaceful relations among nations, without which we cannot achieve any of our goals.@@@That has not changed, and that must not change.@@@Yet, for the second year in a row, this gathering, dedicated to the peaceful resolution of conflicts, is darkened by the shadow of war — an illegal war of conquest brought, without provocation, by Russia against its neighbour.@@@Ukraine.@@@Like every nation in the world, the United States wants this war to end.@@@No nation wants this war to end more than Ukraine.@@@And we strongly support Ukraine in its efforts to bring about a diplomatic resolution that delivers just and lasting peace.@@@But Russia alone bears responsibility for this war.@@@Russia alone has the power to end this war immediately.@@@And it is Russia alone that stands in the way of peace because Russia’s price for peace is Ukraine’s capitulation.@@@Ukraine’s territory and Ukraine’s children.@@@Russia believes that the world will grow weary and allow it to brutalize Ukraine without consequences.@@@But let me ask the Assembly this.@@@If we abandon the core principles of the United Nations to appease an aggressor, can any of the members of this body feel confident that they are protected?@@@If we allow Ukraine to be carved up, is the independence of any nation secure?@@@I would respectfully suggest that the answer is no.@@@We have to stand up to that naked aggression today and deter other would-be aggressors tomorrow.@@@That is why the United States, together with its allies and partners around the world, will continue to stand with the brave people of Ukraine as they defend their sovereignty, territorial integrity and freedom.@@@It is an investment not only in Ukraine’s future but in the future of every country that seeks a world governed by basic rules that apply equally to all nations and uphold the rights of every nation, no matter how big or how small.@@@Sovereignty and territorial integrity are the fixed foundations of this body and universal human rights are its North Star.@@@We cannot sacrifice either of them.@@@Seventy-five years ago, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights captured a remarkable act of collective hope — I repeat, a collective hope drafted by a committee representing different regions, faiths and philosophies, and adopted by the entire General Assembly.@@@The rights contained in the Declaration are elemental and enduring, and while we still struggle to uphold equal and inalienable rights for all, they remain ever steady and true.@@@We cannot turn away from abuses, whether in Xinjiang.@@@Tehran.@@@Darfur or anywhere else.@@@We have to continue working to ensure that women and girls enjoy equal rights and equal participation in their societies; that indigenous groups, racial, ethnic and religious minorities and people with disabilities do not have their potential stifled by systemic discrimination; and that LGBTQI+ people are not prosecuted or targeted with violence because of who they are.@@@Those rights are part of our shared humanity.@@@They are absent when they are absent anywhere, and their loss is felt everywhere.@@@They are essential to the advancement of the human progress that brings us together.@@@Let me end with this.@@@At this inflection point in history, we are going to be judged by whether or not we live up to the promises we have made to ourselves, to each other, to the most vulnerable and to all who will inherit the world we create, because that is what we ourselves are doing.@@@Will we find within ourselves the courage to do what must be done to preserve the planet, protect human dignity, provide opportunity for people everywhere and defend the tenets of the United Nations?@@@There can be only one answer to that question.@@@We must, and we will.@@@The road ahead is long and difficult, but we can persevere and prevail if we keep the faith in ourselves and show what is possible.@@@Let us do this work together.@@@Let us deliver progress for everyone.@@@Let us bend the arc of history for the good of the world, because it is in our power to do it.@@@The United Nations was founded on a simple, yet paradigmatic vision — a world governed by law, a world coming together to promote social progress and better standards of life, a world respectful of the dignity and worth of every human being and a world where problems are solved through 
international cooperation.@@@The generation articulating that vision had just endured the Second World War.@@@They had, in the words of the Charter of the United Nations, experienced “untold sorrow” — death and destruction on an unprecedented scale.@@@As we consider the multitude of challenges facing our generation, we can find inspiration in the visionary perspectives that led to the establishment of this Organization — the pursuit of a better future and the commitment to seeking it together.@@@Norway is a staunch supporter of the United Nations.@@@The principles of the Charter are of fundamental importance to us.@@@They are the basis of our security.@@@They are a critical foundation for our prosperity.@@@They guide our approach to international problem-solving and, for a small country such as ours, there is no viable alternative.@@@Respect for international law is a core national interest for Norway.@@@Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine is therefore of great concern to us.@@@Let me use this opportunity to explain why.@@@Russia is our neighbour.@@@It is responsible for a blatant breach of the United Nations Charter.@@@It has violated fundamental principles of international law.@@@It has created a grave international crisis — a permanent member of the Security Council seeking to deny the right of another State Member of the United Nations to exist, launching an unprovoked and illegal war, conducting that war in the most brutal manner, with complete disregard for human life and the rules of war, and occupying the largest nuclear power plant in Europe, thereby risking a grave nuclear incident.@@@Norway has spoken out against that war.@@@We have provided extensive civilian, military and humanitarian support to Ukraine, and will do so for as long as it takes.@@@We are actively supporting President Zelenskyy’s peace formula in the understanding that the pursuit of peace is important, but on terms defined by Ukraine — the victim of an illegal aggression.@@@At the same time, we are also maintaining our strong engagement at the global level.@@@We are assisting countries that are affected by the repercussions of the war, and we will continue to do so.@@@The war taking place on the European continent is a watershed moment for Norway and for the rest of the world.@@@It is an attack on the basic principles of the United Nations Charter, with global ramifications.@@@Food insecurity has increased dramatically.@@@Energy supplies are under pressure.@@@Inflation has soared.@@@Russia’s war against Ukraine has exacerbated a global, negative economic spiral.@@@It is jeopardizing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, while also diverting attention from other pressing issues.@@@That is deeply concerning.@@@This decade is of critical importance to humankind, our environment and our planet.@@@We simply cannot fail to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement targets.@@@We cannot afford to let the window of opportunity close.@@@We must act now.@@@Norway is doing its part.@@@We have enhanced our climate target and will cut emissions by at least 55 per cent by 2030, as compared to the 1990 levels.@@@We are increasing carbon taxes.@@@We are expanding the uptake of zero-emission technologies in the transport sector.@@@We are investing heavily in offshore wind, carbon capture and storage and a green industrial future.@@@We are actively participating in the climate negotiations and will go to the twenty-eighth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Dubai with the aim to keep the 1.5°C target alive.@@@In Glasgow, we announced that we would double our climate financing by 2026.@@@I am pleased to report that we have already achieved that.@@@Over the past 15 years.@@@Norway has provided more than $5 billion in support to tropical forest countries.@@@We will continue to provide a high level of funding under that initiative up to 2030.@@@On Thursday this week, my Prime Minister co-chaired a meeting of the Global Leadership Council for the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet (GEAPP).@@@Together with philanthropists, multilateral development banks and other partners, we will work to unlock renewable energy access in emerging economies, creating an energy system for the future, reducing emissions, facilitating job creation and, not least, improving energy access for the 3.6 billion people currently living in energy poverty.@@@Through GEAPP, as well as Norway’s Climate Investment Fund, we have mobilized significant investments.@@@In 2024, we will launch a dedicated guarantee instrument for developing countries to encourage further private investments in renewable energy.@@@Food security is part and parcel of the climate agenda and a defining challenge of our time.@@@Achieving food security is essential to achieving the SDGs.@@@Too many people lack access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food.@@@In response.@@@Norway has geared up its efforts to combat food insecurity by providing $500 million this year for developing countries to offset the global ramifications of the war in Ukraine and by placing food security at the heart of our development policy.@@@We are investing in small-scale producers.@@@We have increased our efforts to combat food loss and waste.@@@Those are important steps, not just because they will improve food security, but because we must transform the food system if we are to reach our climate goals.@@@The sustainable use of the oceans is part of the Norwegian DNA.@@@Norway’s Prime Minister is co-Chair of the High-level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy.@@@I am pleased to report that the Panel’s 18 Member States will develop sustainable ocean plans by the time of the United Nations Ocean Conference in 2025.@@@I am also encouraged that so far more than 75 States, with Norway as one of them, has signed the Agreement on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biodiversity in Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction.@@@That is an important step towards improving ocean governance and cooperation.@@@It shows that the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea can adapt to meet evolving challenges, and it demonstrates the continuing strength and promise of multilateralism despite geopolitical tensions.@@@The coronavirus disease pandemic had devastating consequences for people, communities, health systems and economies across the world.@@@It was a global wake-up call.@@@We must better prepare for the next pandemic.@@@Safeguarding global public health requires close, broad-based international collaboration.@@@It requires financing as well as investments in universal health coverage.@@@We support the development of a pandemic accord at the World Health Organization, and we call for rapid agreement on an interim mechanism on medical countermeasures.@@@We are all familiar with the dividends of peace.@@@Yet, as a community, we have long underestimated the value of conflict prevention.@@@I would therefore like to thank the Secretary-General for setting out his New Agenda for Peace.@@@We agree wholeheartedly with the emphasis on preventive diplomacy.@@@In a fractured world, with rising geopolitical tensions, it is critical that we seek common ground where we can find it, that we invest in dialogue and that we strive to understand each other, however deep disagreements may seem.@@@Dialogue is essential.@@@Without dialogue, we have fewer opportunities to influence, encourage or simply explore political solutions in situations of conflict.@@@Dialogue is at the heart of diplomacy.@@@It is a basic tool for solving problems and for realizing the vision on which the United Nations is built.@@@We welcome renewed regional dialogue in the Middle East.@@@Signs of de-escalation and intensified diplomatic activity among the countries of the region are very welcome.@@@We remain committed to seeking peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians despite concerning developments and, in this thirtieth anniversary year of the Oslo Accords, encourage much greater efforts towards creating a viable Palestinian State.@@@As guarantor in Colombia, we support the peace agreement with the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia and the ongoing negotiations between the Government and the Ejercito del Pueblo.@@@We are maintaining our engagement in the Horn of Africa by providing substantial humanitarian support and a standing offer to assist parties looking for political solutions.@@@In Afghanistan, we engage the de facto authorities in Kabul.@@@If that can help to address the dire humanitarian situation, especially for women and girls, who are being deprived of education and a future, it is worth the attempt.@@@Human rights are at the core of this Organization.@@@They articulate a binding agenda for fulfilling human potential.@@@They are integral to the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@They are instrumental in realizing almost any policy objective.@@@Societies prosper when women and girls participate on an equal footing and are free to exercise their sexual and reproductive health and rights.@@@Good solutions are identified where ideas can be articulated freely.@@@Sustainable economic growth requires the rule of law.@@@The point is that the case for human rights is solid, whether approached from values, from the law or more instrumentally.@@@We all should therefore be concerned that standards are slipping in many places.@@@That has to stop.@@@As Governments, human potential is our most precious resource.@@@We cannot afford to waste it.@@@Let me say to those who are taking risks and are standing up for human rights and democracy, to civil society, to lawyers, to journalists and to human rights defenders that they are making the world a better place.@@@They have our support.@@@I began by referencing the establishment of this Organization.@@@A critical moment in world history, it was the beginning of an era of institutionalized international cooperation, of rights and responsibilities and of a shared agenda to improve the human condition.@@@That agenda is as important as ever and, as Member States, it is our task to find ways to make progress.@@@We listen attentively to proposals for renewal, for innovation and for creativity.@@@The General Assembly is the world’s most important forum for dialogue and discussion.@@@We are thankful that it exists, so let us get to work finding common ground, solving problems across borders, revitalizing the 2030 Agenda and honouring our international obligations and commitments.@@@Let us bow our heads together and beseech God Almighty to let His peace and mercy descend on us all and on our fragile home — the planet.@@@I extend to all the warmest greetings of lakwe from the people of the Republic of the Marshall Islands.@@@I congratulate the President on his election to lead the General Assembly.@@@I also offer sincere condolences for the devastating flood in Libya and the earthquake in Morocco.@@@A strong and effective United Nations is needed now more than ever.@@@Together we now face an economic shock, increasing global tension and intensified climate impacts.@@@Our United Nations was forged to help maintain peace, reduce threats and conflict and address the economic and social challenges facing humankind.@@@It has also served a useful purpose as a key platform for dialogue among nations, and we acknowledge the strong efforts of the United Nations system in humanitarian relief and assistance with development goals.@@@Yet the world is at an hour when, more than ever before, we are falling well short of what the world needs and deserves.@@@The world is now vastly different from that of 78 years ago.@@@The remarkable advances in all spheres of human life have been phenomenal and unrivalled.@@@New advances have facilitated people-to-people connectivity and help to shrink our planet into a small global village.@@@Yet we are feeling an intense rise in the very global tensions, if not the threat of wider conflict, that the founding Members sought to avert.@@@Politics must never blind the need for accountability, not only in Russia’s illegal and immoral invasion of Ukraine but everywhere, without exception.@@@Every nation in this Hall, including my own, has more to do to deliver on our human rights records.@@@Far greater understanding and direct assistance are needed to better address complex rights situations.@@@Every nation gathered in this Hall bears a vital responsibility to protect, not overstep, the voices of the most vulnerable.@@@As a candidate country for election to the Human Rights Council for the term from 2025 to 2027, we are firmly committed to strong and credible action, as well as to listening closely to all perspectives.@@@We are proud to call attention to the recent endorsement of our candidacy by the Pacific Islands Forum Foreign Ministers.@@@The Pacific small island developing States are truly large ocean nations before we are small island developing States.@@@Oceans are not a distant notion.@@@They are our lifeblood, our economic future, our food security and our culture.@@@Much of the rest of the world has used oceans as dumping grounds or resource baskets from which to take at will, without consequence.@@@Now the tide is changing.@@@Pacific island nations help to set the mark in global tuna markets and affect a transition to sustainability.@@@Our partners are helping us to step up with resources, partnerships and real-time technology to better monitor and patrol our vast exclusive economic zones.@@@The United Nations has now adopted a new high seas conservation treaty that addresses biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction.@@@At a time when nations are increasingly challenged to work together on the basics, it is a testament to the political will and diplomatic skill in which we have come together to cut across silos and define specific actions and obligations to try to better ensure that future generations see the same benefits from the ocean that we know today.@@@It is our challenge to the world to bring that treaty into force and effect before the 2025 Our Oceans Conference.@@@Today the United Nations now has my signature on the treaty to add to the growing chorus.@@@The world’s equilibrium has been upset by humankind’s insatiable greed for the accumulation of materialistic wealth and possessions.@@@Today the Marshall Islands is encountering insurmountable challenges in coping with sea level rise, the erosion of shorelines, flooding caused by high tides, coral bleaching, the intrusion of seawater into taro and crop lands and the rapid deterioration of the ocean ecological system.@@@Moreover, the warming of the ocean has affected sustainable coastal fisheries and has had a direct negative impact on our way of life.@@@In sum, our islands, our culture, our way of life and our very existence as a people and a nation are threatened.@@@We call for the establishment of an international financing facility to provide assistance and support to small island developing States and low-lying atoll nations and territories devastated during and after natural disasters.@@@Such a facility should also offer elements of insulation from external shocks, be it energy, supply-chain disruptions, food security, global health pandemics, hyperinflation or other challenges.@@@The Marshall Islands leaders have raised the alarm and called the world’s attention to the dangers posed by the climate change monster since we became a Member of this body in 1991.@@@For more than 30 years.@@@Marshallese leaders, as is the case with leaders of low- lying island States, have sounded the alarm in every international and regional forum.@@@For more than 30 years, the world has been meeting and talking about the adverse effect of global warming and climate change.@@@We hailed the historic conclusion of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.@@@However, eight years have gone by, carbon emission levels remain high and the planet is getting hotter with each passing day.@@@As a matter of fact, the Secretary-General himself has affirmed that the era of global warming has ended and that now we have entered the age of global boiling.@@@May I again reiterate my humble call for the world to declare war on climate change.@@@The future of the Marshall Islands and all low-lying island States hangs in the balance.@@@The eyes of people the world over are on us at this seventy-eighth session of the General Assembly.@@@The Marshall Islands believes that the time for speeches and eloquence of talk is over.@@@It is time for the eloquence of actions.@@@Let deeds, not words, be our operating principle.@@@The security of our own islands is at stake, owing to not only the tension among super-Powers, but also rising seas and changing oceans.@@@The world has spent a full generation falling short in our common goals to prevent dangerous climate change.@@@We are past the hour of waiting for a real step-up in ambition.@@@This year must be different.@@@At the twenty-eighth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the global stocktake must mark the turning point at which we all recognize that we are collectively failing to deliver on the Paris Agreement.@@@We must all respond by agreeing upon a clear road map to correct our course.@@@That ambitious road map must include the phase-out of fossil fuels.@@@The world cannot afford to further ignore the issue at the heart of the crisis.@@@While we must use every tool at our disposal, we cannot place our hope in dreams of unproven, untested solutions or use abatement technology to give the green light to the continued expansion of fossil fuels.@@@For the most vulnerable nations, adequate, predictable and accessible finance is crucial, particularly for adapting to prepare for the current and future onslaught of the impacts of climate change and to address the loss and damage that are already being experienced.@@@We need donors to deliver on their existing commitments and to come together to address the climate finance crisis in a way that is led by science and the needs of vulnerable States.@@@Those challenges may be inconvenient for large economies, but I can affirm that the climate impacts already at our door, and those yet to come are decidedly more inconvenient for low-lying atoll States such as mine and for other island nations around the world.@@@The United States has not fulfilled its obligations to the people of the Marshall Islands resulting from the nuclear testing programme.@@@On 25 November 1947, in response to concerns about the people of Enewetak. 
who were being removed and relocated so that the United States could conduct its nuclear-weapons test.@@@United States President Harry S. Truman stated:
“They [the Enewetakese] will be accorded all rights which are the normal constitutional rights of the citizens under the Constitution, but will be dealt with as wards of the United States for whom this country has special responsibilities”.@@@Other atolls were affected, and such obligations likewise remain unfulfilled.@@@The Marshall Islands has continued its negotiations with the United States on extending our relationship of free association.@@@We have come a long way in that endeavour.@@@We have satisfactorily addressed most issues, and we remain cautiously optimistic that our agreements will be finalized soon.@@@However, there remain difficult issues that the Marshallese people have insisted need to be resolved.@@@As a functioning democracy, we cannot ignore the wishes of our people and, as the world’s foremost and pre-eminent democracy, the United States needs to understand that reality.@@@The Marshall Islands desires to continue its free association with the United States, but the United States must realize that the Marshallese people require that the nuclear issue be addressed.@@@The Marshall Islands strongly welcomes the rise of the Partners in the Blue Pacific initiative and the support of friends and allies that are committed to working with us on island-driven solutions.@@@Our early steps together are positive, even as more structure is needed to listen closely to our deepest needs.@@@Let us all go beyond the headline announcements and into our local communities and move into a more focused dialogue with the Pacific, and not just about the Pacific.@@@The Republic of the Marshall Islands affirms the recent statement by the Pacific Islands Forum Foreign Ministers regarding the release of treated water from the Fukushima power plant.@@@With other Forum members, we remain vigilant, concerned and committed to regular and ongoing discussion with Japan, as well as an annual dialogue with the International Atomic Energy Agency.@@@I appeal to all Heads of States and Government that we work together to strengthen the foundation of international peace and security.@@@Let us then jointly call for the Secretary-General’s Summit of the Future, to be held next year, to include diverse perspectives and voices and to forge a watershed moment for peace and security.@@@We have before us all a valuable opportunity to strengthen the pillars of accountability and United Nations system reform.@@@Together we can all help to ensure that the United Nations is truly fit for purpose and better aligned with contemporary challenges.@@@The fourth International Conference on Small Island Developing States, to be held in Antigua and Barbuda next year, is likewise a spotlight moment for island- driven solutions and strategies.@@@There remains a visible crack in the United Nations.@@@Our United Nations will never be whole and complete without the meaningful participation of the 23 million people of Taiwan in the specialized agencies of the United Nations system, as well as in meetings and mechanisms that support the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@Difficult indeed would it be for our United Nations family to build further trust and prosperity among us while also closing the doors of our Organization to Taiwanese journalists and public visitors.@@@For too long.@@@United Nations bureaucracy has stuck to a wrongful misinterpretation of Security Council resolution 2758 (1971) and has used politically influenced conclusions to exclude any clear engagement with the people of Taiwan and their vibrant democracy.@@@We must have the courage to recognize the reality of the current situation and relegate that outdated dogma to the annals of history.@@@Today the United Nations can no longer look the other way and ignore the need to actively facilitate peace, stability and security across the Taiwan Strait and within the region.@@@We commend the Secretary- General’s commitment for the United Nations to do its utmost to ease tensions in the Strait and prevent escalations by involving all stakeholders.@@@Through logic and common sense, we believe that that must include Taiwan.@@@Is it possible for us to wage peace instead of war?@@@Is it too much to ask that the United Nations declare war on climate change and global boiling, poverty, racism, injustices, the inequitable distribution of wealth, the wide gulf between the haves and the have-nots and the exploitation of the planet’s finite resources?@@@We must help to hasten the peace foretold by Isaiah when
“They shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more” (The Holy Bible, Isaiah 2:4).@@@Over three millenniums ago, our great leader Moses addressed the people of Israel as they were about to enter the Promised Land.@@@He said that they would find there two mountains facing one another: Mount Gerizim, the site on which a great blessing would be proclaimed, and Mount Ebal, the site of a great curse.@@@Moses said that the people’s fate would be determined by the choice they made between the blessing and the curse.@@@That same choice has echoed down the ages not just for the people of Israel but for all humankind.@@@We face such a choice today.@@@It will determine whether we enjoy the blessings of a historic peace of boundless prosperity and hope or suffer the curse of a horrific war, terrorism and despair.@@@When I last spoke at this rostrum five years ago (see A/73/PV.10).@@@I warned about the tyrants of Tehran.@@@They have been nothing but a curse — a curse to their own people, to our region and to the entire world.@@@But at that time.@@@I also spoke about a great blessing that I could see on the horizon.@@@I said that the common threat of Iran had
“brought Israel and many Arab States closer than ever before, in [a] ., friendship that I have not seen in my lifetime” (A/73/PV.10, p.39).@@@I said that the day would “soon arrive when Israel [would] be able to expand peace .., beyond Egypt and Jordan to other Arab neighbours” (ibid.).@@@Now, in countless meetings with world leaders.@@@I made the case that Israel and the Arab States shared many common interests and that I believed that those many common interests could facilitate a breakthrough for a broader peace in our region.@@@Some may applaud now, but at the time many dismissed my optimism as wishful thinking.@@@Their pessimism was based on a quarter-century of good intentions and failed peacemaking.@@@Why were those good intentions?@@@Why did they always meet failure?@@@Because they were based on one false idea — that unless we first concluded a peace agreement with the Palestinians, no other Arab State would normalize its relations with Israel.@@@I have long sought to make peace with the Palestinians, but I also believe that we must not give the Palestinians a veto over new peace treaties with Arab States.@@@The Palestinians could greatly benefit from a broader peace.@@@They should be part of the process, but they should not have a veto over the process.@@@And I also believe that making peace with more Arab States would actually increase the prospects of making peace between Israel and the Palestinians.@@@The Palestinians are only 2 per cent of the Arab world.@@@As long as they believe that the other 98 per cent will remain in a warlike State with Israel, that larger mass, that larger Arab world, could eventually choke, dissolve and destroy the Jewish State.@@@So when the Palestinians see that most of the Arab world has reconciled itself to the Jewish State, they too will be more likely to abandon the fantasy of destroying Israel and finally embrace a path of genuine peace with it.@@@For years, my approach to peace was rejected by the so-called experts.@@@Well, they were wrong.@@@Under their approach, we did not forge a single peace treaty for a quarter-century.@@@Yet in 2020, under the approach that I advocated, we tried something different, and in no time we achieved a remarkable breakthrough.@@@We achieved four peace treaties, working with the United States.@@@Israel forged four peace agreements in four months with four Arab countries: the United Arab Emirates.@@@Bahrain, the Sudan and Morocco.@@@The Abraham Accords were a pivot of history.@@@And today, we all see the blessings of those accords.@@@Trade and investment with our new peace partners are booming.@@@Our nations cooperate in commerce, energy, water, agriculture, medicine, climate and many, many other fields.@@@Close to a million Israelis have visited the United Arab Emirates in the past three years.@@@Every day.@@@Israelis save time and money by doing something they could not do for 70 years.@@@They fly over the Arabian peninsula to destinations in the Gulf.@@@India, the Far East and Australia.@@@The Abraham Accords ushered in another dramatic change.@@@They brought Arabs and Jews closer together.@@@We see it in the frequent Jewish weddings in Dubai, in the dedication of a Torah scroll in a synagogue in Bahrain, in the visitors flocking to the Museum of Moroccan Judaism in Casablanca.@@@We see it in lessons that are given to Arab students about the Holocaust in the United Arab Emirates.@@@There is no question, the Abraham Accords heralded the dawn of a new age of peace.@@@But I believe that we are at the cusp of an even more dramatic breakthrough — an historic peace between Israel and Saudi Arabia.@@@Such a peace will go a long way to ending the Arab-Israeli conflict.@@@It will encourage other Arab 
States to normalize relations with Israel.@@@It will enhance the prospects of peace with the Palestinians.@@@It will encourage a broader reconciliation between Judaism and Islam, between Jerusalem and Mecca, between the descendants of Isaac and the descendants of Ishmael.@@@All those are tremendous blessings.@@@Two weeks ago, we saw another blessing already in sight.@@@At the Group of 20 Summit.@@@President Biden.@@@Prime Minister Modi and European and Arab leaders announced plans for a visionary corridor that will stretch across the Arabian peninsula and Israel.@@@It will connect India to Europe with maritime links, rail links, energy pipelines and fibre-optic cables.@@@That corridor will bypass maritime chokepoints and dramatically lower the costs of goods, communication and energy for over 2 billion people.@@@That is an historic change for my country.@@@The land of Israel is situated on the crossroads between Africa.@@@Asia and Europe, and for centuries my country was repeatedly invaded by empires passing through it on their campaigns of plunder and conquest elsewhere.@@@But today, as we tear down walls of enmity.@@@Israel can become a bridge of peace and prosperity between those continents.@@@Peace between Israel and Saudi Arabia will truly create a new Middle East.@@@So everyone should understand the magnitude of the transformation that we seek to advance.@@@Here I display a map of the Middle East in 1948, the year Israel was established.@@@Here is Israel in 1948.@@@It is a tiny country, isolated and surrounded by a hostile Arab world.@@@In our first 70 years, we made peace with Egypt and Jordan.@@@And then in 2020, we made the Abraham Accords, peace with another four Arab States.@@@Now let us look at what happens when we make peace between Israel and Saudi Arabia.@@@The whole Middle East changes.@@@We tear down the walls of enmity.@@@We bring the possibility of peace to the entire region.@@@But we do something else.@@@A few years ago.@@@I stood here with a red marker to show the curse — a great curse, the curse of a nuclear Iran.@@@But today.@@@I bring this marker to show a great blessing — the blessing of a new Middle East between Israel.@@@Saudi Arabia and our other neighbours.@@@We will not only bring down barriers between Israel and our neighbours; we will build a new corridor of peace and prosperity that connects Asia through the United Arab Emirates.@@@Saudi Arabia.@@@Jordan and Israel to Europe.@@@That is an extraordinary change, a monumental change, another pivot of history.@@@As the circle of peace expands.@@@I believe that a real path towards a genuine peace with our Palestinian neighbours can finally be achieved.@@@But there is a caveat.@@@It has to be said here forcefully.@@@Peace can be achieved only if it is based on truth.@@@It cannot be based on lies.@@@It cannot be based on the endless vilification of the Jewish people.@@@Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas must stop spreading the horrible antisemitic conspiracies against the Jewish people and the Jewish State.@@@He recently said that Hitler was not an antisemite.@@@You cannot make this up.@@@But he did.@@@He said that.@@@The Palestinian Authority must stop glorifying terrorists.@@@It must stop its ghoulish pay-to- slay policy of giving money to Palestinian terrorists for the murder of Jews.@@@That is all outrageous.@@@It must stop for peace to prevail.@@@Antisemitism must be rejected wherever it appears, whether on the left or on the right, whether in the halls of universities or in the halls of the United Nations.@@@For peace to prevail, the Palestinians must stop spewing Jew-hatred and finally reconcile themselves to the Jewish State.@@@By that I mean not only to the existence of the Jewish State but to the right of the Jewish people to have a State of their own in their historic homeland, the land of Israel.@@@And let me say, the people of Israel yearn for such a peace.@@@I yearn for such a peace.@@@As a young soldier over half a century ago, my comrades and I in Israel’s Special Forces faced mortal danger on many fronts and on many battlefields.@@@From the warm waters of the Suez Canal to the frozen slopes of Mount Hermon, from the banks of the Jordan river to the tarmac of Beirut airport.@@@Those experiences and other experiences taught me the cost of war.@@@A fellow soldier was killed next to me.@@@Another died in my arms.@@@I buried my older brother.@@@Those who have personally suffered the curse of war can best appreciate the blessings of peace.@@@There are many hurdles on the path of peace.@@@There are many hurdles on the extraordinary path to peace that I have just described.@@@But I am committed to doing everything I can to overcome those hurdles, to forge a better future for Israel and all the peoples in our region.@@@Two days ago.@@@I discussed that vision of peace with President Biden.@@@We share the same optimism for what can be achieved, and I deeply appreciate his commitment to seizing this historic opportunity.@@@The United States of America is indispensable in that effort.@@@Just as we achieved the Abraham Accords with the leadership of 
President Trump.@@@I believe we can achieve peace with Saudi Arabia with the leadership of President Biden.@@@Working together with the leadership of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, we can shape a future of great blessings for all our peoples.@@@Now we all know that there is a fly in that ointment, because we may rest assured that the fanatics ruling Iran will do everything they can to thwart this historic peace.@@@Iran continues to spend billions to arm its terror proxies.@@@It continues to extend its terror tentacles in the Middle East.@@@Europe.@@@Asia.@@@South America and even North America.@@@It even tried to assassinate the Secretary of State of the United States of America.@@@It even tried to assassinate the National Security Advisor of the United States of America.@@@That tells us all we need to know about Iran’s murderous intentions and Iran’s murderous nature.@@@Iran continues to threaten international shipping lanes, hold foreign nationals for ransom and engage in nuclear blackmail.@@@Over the past year, its murderous goons have killed hundreds and arrested thousands of Iran’s brave citizens.@@@Iran’s drones and missile programme threaten Israel and our Arab neighbours.@@@And Iran’s drones have brought and bring death and destruction to innocent people in the Ukraine.@@@Yet the regime’s aggression is largely met by indifference in the international community.@@@Eight years ago, the Western Powers promised that if Iran violated the nuclear deal, the sanctions would be snapped back.@@@Well.@@@Iran is violating the deal but the sanctions have not been snapped back.@@@To stop its nuclear ambitions, that policy must change.@@@Sanctions must be snapped back and, above all.@@@Iran must face a credible military threat.@@@As long as I am Prime Minister of Israel.@@@I will do everything in my power to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons.@@@Equally, we should support the brave women and men of Iran who despise the regime and yearn for freedom, who have gone out bravely on the sidewalks of Tehran and Iran’s other cities and faced death.@@@It is the people of Iran, not their oppressors, who are our real partners for a better future.@@@Whether our future will prove to be a blessing or a curse will also depend on how we address perhaps the most consequential development of our time — the rise of artificial intelligence (Al).@@@The Al revolution is progressing at lightning speed.@@@It took centuries for humankind to adapt to the agricultural revolution.@@@It took decades to adapt to the industrial revolution.@@@We may have but a few years to adapt to the Al revolution.@@@The perils are great, and they are before us: the disruption of democracy, the manipulation of minds, the decimation of jobs, the proliferation of crime and the hacking of all the systems that facilitate modern life.@@@Yet even more disturbing is the potential eruption of Al-driven wars that could achieve an unimaginable scale.@@@Behind that perhaps looms an even greater threat, once the stuff of science fiction — that self-taught machines could eventually control humans instead of the other way around.@@@The world’s leading nations, however competitive, must address those dangers.@@@We must do so quickly, and we must do so together.@@@We must ensure that the promise of an Al utopia does not turn into an Al dystopia.@@@We have so much to gain.@@@Let us imagine the blessings of finally cracking the genetic code, extending human life by decades and dramatically reducing the ravages of old age.@@@Let us imagine health care tailored to each individual’s genetic composition and predictive medicine that prevents diseases long before they occur.@@@Let us imagine robots helping to care for the elderly.@@@Let us imagine the end of traffic jams with self-driving vehicles on the ground, below the ground and in the air.@@@Let us imagine personalized education that cultivates each person’s full potential throughout their lifetime.@@@Let us imagine a world with boundless clean energy and natural resources for all nations.@@@Let us imagine precision agriculture and automated factories that yield food and goods in an abundance that ends hunger and want.@@@I know that sounds like a John Lennon song, but it could all happen.@@@Let us imagine that we can achieve the end of scarcity, something that has eluded humankind for all history.@@@It is all within our reach.@@@And here is something else within our reach.@@@With Al, we can explore the heavens as never before and extend humankind beyond our blue planet.@@@For good or bad, the developments of Al will be spearheaded by a handful of nations.@@@And my country.@@@Israel, is already among them.@@@Just as Israel’s technological revolution provided the world with breathtaking innovations.@@@I am confident that Al developed by Israel will once again help all humankind.@@@I call upon world leaders to come together to shape the great changes before us, but to do so in a responsible and ethical way.@@@Our goal must be to ensure that Al brings more freedom and not less, prevents wars instead of starting them, and ensures that people live longer.@@@healthier, more productive and peaceful lives.@@@That is in our reach.@@@As we harness the powers of Al, let us always remember the irreplaceable value of human intuition and wisdom.@@@Let us cherish and preserve the human capacity for empathy, which no machine can replace.@@@Thousands of years ago.@@@Moses presented the children of Israel with a timeless and universal choice.@@@“Behold.@@@I set before you this day a blessing and a curse” (The Holy Bible, Deuteronomy, 11-26).@@@May we choose wisely between the curse and the blessings that stand before us this day.@@@Let us harness our resolve and our courage to stop the curse of a nuclear Iran and roll back its fanaticism and aggression.@@@Let us bring forth the blessings of a new Middle East that will transform lands once ridden with conflict and chaos into fields of prosperity and peace.@@@And may we avoid the perils of Al by combining the forces of human and machine intelligence to usher in a brilliant future for our world, in our time and for all time.@@@Let me begin by expressing our felicitations to you.@@@Mr. Dennis Francis.@@@President of the General Assembly, and our fullest support to the theme of the seventy-eighth general debate.@@@“Rebuilding trust and reigniting global solidarity: Accelerating action on the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals towards peace, prosperity, progress and sustainability for all”.@@@This is an occasion to take stock of our achievements and challenges even while sharing our aspirations and goals.@@@And indeed, in regard to both, there is much that India has to share.@@@The world is witnessing an exceptional period of turmoil.@@@As it is, structural inequities and uneven development have imposed burdens on the global South.@@@But the stresses have been aggravated by the impact of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and the repercussions of ongoing conflicts, tensions and disputes.@@@As a result, the socioeconomic gains of recent years have been rolled back, resources for sustainable development are severely challenged and many countries are really struggling to make ends meet.@@@Navigating the future appears even more daunting.@@@At this juncture, it was with a sense of exceptional responsibility that India took up the presidency of the Group of 20 (G20).@@@Our vision of “One Earth.@@@One Family.@@@One Future” sought to focus on the key concerns of the many, not just the narrow interests of a few.@@@In the words of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, it was to bridge divides, dismantle barriers and sow the seeds of collaboration that nourish a world where unity prevails over discord and where shared destiny eclipses isolation.@@@The New Delhi G20 Leaders’ Declaration articulates our collective ability to do so.@@@At a time when East-West polarization is so sharp and North-South divide so deep, the New Delhi Summit also affirms that diplomacy and dialogue are the only effective solutions.@@@The international order is diverse and we must cater to divergences, if not differences.@@@The days when a few nations set the agenda and expected others to fall in line are over.@@@As the United Nations itself symbolizes, finding common ground is an imperative.@@@To listen to others and to respect their viewpoints is not weakness; it is the basics of cooperation.@@@Only then can collective efforts on global issues be successful.@@@Recognizing that growth and development must focus on the most vulnerable, we began the G20 presidency by convening the Voice of Global South Summit.@@@That enabled us to hear directly from 125 nations and to place their concerns on the G20 agenda.@@@As a consequence, the issues that deserve global attention got a fair hearing.@@@More than that, the deliberations produced outcomes that have great significance for the international community.@@@It was also noteworthy, that at India’s initiative, the African Union was admitted as a permanent member of the G20.@@@By doing so, we gave voice to an entire continent that has long been denied its due.@@@That significant step in reform should inspire the United Nations, a much older organization, to also make the Security Council contemporary.@@@Broad representation is, after all, a prerequisite for both effectiveness and credibility.@@@The outcomes of the New Delhi G20 Summit will surely resonate for years ahead.@@@Among them is the Action Plan for Sustainable Development Goals, a crucial need of the day.@@@Equally important are the High-Level Principles on Lifestyles for Sustainable Development and the Green Development Pact, as they shape our approach to our planet’s future.@@@The transformative role of digital public infrastructure has also been finally recognized, as has the salience of women-led development in building an inclusive and progressive society.@@@The reform of the international financial institutions has been given due weight, as has the resolution of debt vulnerabilities.@@@The New Delhi G20 outcomes are expressed both as larger policies and as specific initiatives.@@@They could be about building cities for tomorrow or fighting corruption; eliminating hunger or delivering quality education; ending plastic pollution or preserving the ocean-based economy; or for that matter, enhancing food security or even mapping global skills.@@@Some address long-standing issues like the gender divide and climate action.@@@Others focus on new concerns, such as the responsible harnessing of artificial intelligence.@@@All in all, we have placed for the world’s consideration a set of actionable propositions, constructive solutions and new directions.@@@Even as we encourage collective endeavours.@@@India seeks to promote cooperation with diverse partners.@@@From the era of non-alignment, we have now evolved to that of vishwa mitra — a friend to the world.@@@That is reflected in our ability and willingness to engage with a broad range of nations and, where necessary, to harmonize interests.@@@It is visible in the rapid growth of the Quad, a mechanism@@@so relevant to the Indo-Pacific.@@@It is equally apparent in the expansion of the BRICS grouping of the independent-minded nations Brazil.@@@Russia.@@@India.@@@China, and South Africa, or in fact, the emergence of the I2U2 combination.@@@Recently, we hosted the creation of the India-Middle East- Europe Economic Corridor.@@@The forging of the Global Biofuels Alliance was another notable development.@@@That willingness to work in an open-minded manner on specific domains is a defining characteristic of the emerging multipolar order.@@@All countries pursue their national interests.@@@We in India have never seen that as being in contradiction with the global good.@@@When we aspire to be a leading Power, it is not for self-aggrandizement but to take on greater responsibility and make more contributions.@@@The goals we have set for ourselves will make us different from all those whose rise preceded ours.@@@India demonstrated that during the COVID-19 pandemic through the Vaccine Maitri initiative.@@@Our endeavours, like the International Solar Alliance and the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure, have gathered wide support.@@@Our espousing of the International Year of Millets is enhancing global food security today.@@@We have built development partnerships with 78 nations across geographies.@@@We have also been first responder in disaster emergency situations.@@@The people of Türkiye saw that in February, as did those in Syria.@@@Our commitment is understandably even greater closer to home.@@@When Sri Lanka experienced a severe economic crisis, it was India that first stepped forward.@@@But even in distant regions, partners such as the Pacific islands have appreciated our contributions to meeting their needs in health, technology and climate action.@@@The most populous nation and the fifth largest economy knows that its progress makes a real difference to the world, especially when so many nations identify with us for reasons of history, geography and culture.@@@They follow our experiences closely and evaluate our solutions for their larger relevance.@@@Last week, the United Nations assessed progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).@@@The mood here reflected the struggle to overcome challenges, especially those of resource paucity.@@@It is therefore vital at this midway that we expand our capacities and regain our confidence.@@@As the largest contributor to meeting the SDG targets.@@@India’s achievements should give heart to others on this journey.@@@After all, the global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) records that we have halved the global MPI value in the past 15 years, lifting 415 million people out of poverty.@@@That progress has now moved on to a higher level, with ambitious socioeconomic initiatives covering financial inclusion, food and nutrition, health and water supply, as well as energy and housing.@@@We are 
seeking to demonstrate that social welfare need not be the sole prerogative of the developed world.@@@Programmes under way in India highlight the transformational role of the digital delivery of public goods.@@@It has facilitated scaling up, enhanced efficiency and combated corruption.@@@The national objective of leaving no one behind is forging ahead in so many dimensions.@@@Moreover, the democratization of technology has opened mindsets, instilled confidence and inspired innovations.@@@In our deliberations, we often advocate the promotion of a rules-based order.@@@From time to time, respect for the Charter of the United Nations is also invoked.@@@But for all the talk, it is still a few nations that shape the agenda and seek to define the norms.@@@That cannot go on indefinitely, nor will it go unchallenged.@@@A fair, equitable and democratic order will surely emerge once we all put our minds to it.@@@And for a start, that means ensuring that rule-makers do not subjugate rule-takers.@@@After all, rules will work only when they apply equally to all.@@@We must never again allow an injustice like vaccine apartheid to recur.@@@Climate action, too, cannot continue to witness an evasion of historical responsibilities.@@@The power of markets should not be utilized to steer food and energy from the needy to the wealthy, nor must we countenance that political convenience determines responses to terrorism, extremism and violence.@@@Similarly, respect for territorial integrity and non-interference in internal affairs cannot be exercises in cherry-picking.@@@When reality departs from rhetoric, we must have the courage to call it out.@@@Without genuine solidarity, there can never be real trust.@@@That is very much the sentiment of the global South.@@@Next year, the United Nations will be hosting the Summit of the Future.@@@That should serve as a serious opportunity to drive change, champion fairness and reform multilateralism, including the expansion of the Security Council memberships.@@@We must address global challenges imbued with the conviction that we are one Earth and one family, with one future.@@@India has entered the Amrit Kaal, a quarter-century where greater progress and transformation await us.@@@We are confident that our talent and creativity, now so visibly unleashed, will power us forward.@@@The world saw a glimpse of what is to come when our Chandrayaan-3 landed on the moon.@@@Today our message to the world is in digitally enabled governance and delivery, in the widening ambit of amenities and services, in rapidly growing infrastructure, and in our energetic start-up culture.@@@It is visible, too, in vibrant cultural expressions, such as in the arts, yoga, wellness and lifestyle.@@@Our latest assertion is in a pathbreaking legislation to reserve one-third of the seats for women in our legislatures.@@@I speak for a society where ancient traditions of democracy have struck deep modern roots.@@@As a result, our thinking, approaches and actions are now more grounded and authentic.@@@As a civilizational polity that embraces modernity, we bring both tradition and technology equally confidently to the table.@@@It is that fusion that today defines India — that is.@@@Bharat.@@@I would like to extend to Mr. Dennis Francis the warm congratulations of the Guinean delegation on his outstanding election to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session.@@@Before this Assembly.@@@I assure him of the support of my country.@@@At the same time.@@@I pay a well-deserved tribute to his predecessor.@@@Mr Csaba Korosi of Hungary.@@@I thank Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for the dedication with which he leads our Organization.@@@By coming to take part in the work of the seventy-eighth session.@@@I would like to fulfil the duty of conveying the warm greetings of the sovereign people of Guinea.@@@My country continues to place hope in the United Nations capacity to find appropriate solutions to the questions that our world continues to face.@@@In that context, we believe that the fundamentals that underpinned the creation of our Organization must adapt to the profound changes in our society.@@@The objective of the President’s watchwords for this session — peace, prosperity, progress and sustainability — is topical and evocative and deserves our particular attention.@@@I turn to the epidemic of coups d’etat in Africa.@@@In the wake of the coronavirus disease pandemic, the continent has been struck by an epidemic of military putsches, particularly in the French-speaking countries south of the Sahara.@@@Everyone condemns them.@@@Who approves of them?@@@Who is cheered by the sudden reappearance of a practice that we had every reason to think was over?@@@I want to say, however, that the international community must have the honesty and correctness not to be content with merely denouncing the consequences, but also to take an interest in and address the causes.@@@While coups d’etat have increased in recent years in Africa, it is because there are very deep reasons, and to treat the problem we must look into its root causes.@@@The putschist is not only he who takes up arms to overthrow a regime.@@@I hope that we will remember that the real putschists, the most numerous, who are not subject to any condemnation, are also those who scheme, who use deceit, who cheat to manipulate the texts of the constitution in order to remain in power forever.@@@It is those in white collar jobs who change the rules of the game while they are playing it in order to keep hold on the reins of the country.@@@Those are the most numerous putschists.@@@I am one of those who, one morning, decided to shoulder our responsibilities to save our country from complete chaos.@@@It was an insurrectional situation.@@@None of the political stakeholders, all of which were completely neutralized at the time, had the courage or the means to put an end to the deception that we were enduring.@@@The institutional rectification for which my brothers in arms and I assumed our responsibilities on 5 September 2021 was only a consequence of a chaotic situation that ultimately destroyed the social fabric and undermined coexistence.@@@Without going into exhaustive detail, we believe that the transitions under way in Africa are due to several factors, among which we can cite unkept promises, the somnolence of the people and the tinkering with Constitutions by leaders whose only concern is to maintain power indefinitely, to the detriment of collective well-being.@@@Today Africans are more awake than ever and are deciding to take their destiny into their own hands.@@@The unequal distribution of wealth creates endless inequalities, famine and poverty that make the daily lives of our populations increasingly difficult.@@@Those inequalities are among the causes of events that, first and foremost, undermine coexistence.@@@When the wealth of a country is in the hands of an elite while newborns die in hospitals due to lack of incubators, it is not surprising that in such conditions we are seeing transitions to respond to the deep aspirations of the people.@@@Africa suffers from a model of governance that has been imposed on it — a model that is certainly good and effective for the West, which has developed it over the course of its history, but that has difficulty adapting to our realities, customs and environment.@@@Alas, the transplant did not take.@@@I know that when I say this, many will immediately say to themselves.@@@“Another idiot who wants to twist the neck of democracy”.@@@“Another soldier who wants to impose his dictatorship”.@@@However, let me say very clearly, without hypocrisy, without pretence and eye to eye that we are all aware that the mode of democracy that was so insidiously, skilfully and in a quasi-religious manner imposed on us after the Franco-African Summit held in La Baule.@@@France, does not work.@@@Various economic and social indices attest to that.@@@This is not a value judgment on democracy itself, believe me.@@@It is a balance sheet, an observation made over several decades of chaotic experimentation with that model in our environment at a time when the only game in town was the political game, to the detriment of the essential — the economy and the processing of our raw materials in our own countries.@@@Allow me to take this truth exercise a little further.@@@With my brief but intense experience of managing a State. Guinea.@@@I have come to better understand the extent to which that model has contributed above all to maintaining a system of exploitation, the plunder of our resources by others and the very active corruption of our elites — national leaders who have often been 
granted democratic credentials based on their docility, their ability to sell off the resources and property of their people, or even their comfortable surrender to the pseudo-recommendations and injunctions of certain international institutions serving the great Powers.@@@In that regard.@@@I must confess that every challenge facing me is beyond all imagination.@@@It is the same people who profess democracy, transparency and good governance and denounce corruption who dictate the rules.@@@They are the ones who, behind the scenes, are very discreetly and slyly ramping up the pressure to make us cede our assets in one-sided contracts.@@@I now understand certain leaders, some of them my predecessors, who — because they were vulnerable, because they were under pressure, because they had their own baggage or especially because they had a political agenda — gave in to what was asked of them.@@@I understand them without approving of them.@@@Some have even reminded me that if I had a political agenda I would be less comfortable carrying out the reforms that my Government and I have instituted.@@@One thing is certain.@@@We only have one concern—the well-being of the people and coexistence.@@@That is our priority.@@@It is why the transition that I lead has chosen to focus methodically by setting clear objectives in a precise order: the social, the economy and the political.@@@I place my uniform at the service of my people.@@@I would be grateful if the international community would respect that oath and maintain a respectable distance from the divisions of all kinds that many try to fuel in our countries.@@@The Sahel is enduring one of the most serious crises in its very long history, but it has the resources necessary to face it.@@@Its legendary sense of diplomacy must be unleashed so that together we can speak without interference.@@@That is why the Economic Community of West African State, whose purview is the economy, must stop involving itself in politics and favour dialogue.@@@We Africans are tired, exhausted of the categorizations into which everyone wants to confine us.@@@Africa’s population is young.@@@It did not experience the Cold War.@@@It has not experienced the ideological wars that have shaped the world over the past 70 years.@@@That is why we Africans are insulted by the boxes and classifications that sometimes place us under the influence of the Americans, sometimes under that of the English, the French, the Chinese, the Russians and even the Turks.@@@We are neither pro- nor anti-American; neither pro- nor-anti Chinese; neither pro- nor anti-French; neither pro- nor anti-Russian; neither pro- nor anti-Turk.@@@We are simply pro-African.@@@That is all.@@@Seeing us as under the control of this or that Power is an insult, a sign of contempt and racism towards a continent of more than 1.3 billion people.@@@It is important in this prestigious and influential Assembly that we understand clearly and definitively that daddy’s Africa, the old Africa, is over.@@@With a population of more than a billion Africans, some 70 per cent of whom are totally uninhibited young people, young people open to the world and determined to take their destiny into their own hands, the time has come to realize that the structures and rules that arose in the post-Second World War era in the absence of our States, which did not yet exist, are obsolete.@@@This is the end of an unbalanced, unfair era where we had no say in the matter.@@@It is time to take our rights into account, to give us our rightful our place and, above all, to stop lecturing us, looking down on us and treating us like children.@@@The international community may rest assured that we are old enough to know what is good for us.@@@We are mature enough to define our priorities and to design the model that corresponds to our identity, to the reality of our populations and to what we quite simply are.@@@We would be very grateful to the international community for trusting us and letting us run our own business as it has allowed certain regions of the world — such as Asia and the Near and Middle East, to name but a few — to do.@@@This infantilization has the worst effect on young Africans who have emancipated themselves.@@@In that context, we are all challenged and called on to undertake a better analysis of the situation with a view to initiating and pursuing new policies for the benefit of all.@@@The international community must see Africa with new eyes.@@@It must now undertake frank cooperation with it in a spirit of win-win partnership.@@@Those who believe that peace can prevail in the Middle East without the Palestinian people enjoying their full legitimate national rights are delusional.@@@Once again.@@@I come to the Assembly carrying the cause of my people, who are struggling for freedom and independence, to remind members of the tragedy caused by the Nakba 75 years ago, the effects of which continue to be exacerbated by the Israeli occupation of our territory.@@@The occupation challenges the resolutions adopted by the United Nations, which now number more than 1.000, and violates the principles of international law and international legitimacy, while racing against time to change the historical, geographical and demographic reality on the ground, aimed at perpetuating the occupation and entrenching apartheid.@@@Despite that painful reality, and 30 years after the Oslo Accords, which Israel has totally discarded, we still maintain hope that the Organization will be able to implement its resolutions demanding an end to the Israeli occupation of our territory and the realization of the independence of the fully sovereign State of Palestine, with East Jerusalem as its capital, within the borders of 4 June 1967.@@@We still maintain hope to resolve the issue of Palestinian refugees, in accordance with the resolutions of international legitimacy, especially resolution 194 (III), the relevant General Assembly and Security Council resolutions — in particular Security Council resolution 2334 (2016) — and the Arab Peace Initiative, all of which affirm the illegality of the Israeli occupation and its settlements.@@@As I stand here, the Israeli racist right-wing Government continues its attacks on our people and, through its army and its racist terrorist settlers, continues to intimidate and kill our people, destroy homes and property, steal our money and resources and detain the bodies of the martyrs.@@@More than 600 bodies are still detained, and I do not know for what reason.@@@This is being done in full view of the world and without any deterrence, punishment or accountability, and the leaders and ministers of that Government have even been bragging about their apartheid policy against our people under occupation.@@@The Israeli occupation Government also continues to violate the city of Jerusalem and its people, assault our Islamic and Christian sacred sites, and violate the historical and legal status of the holy sites, especially the blessed Al-Aqsa Mosque, which international legitimacy — pursuant to a 1930 resolution of the League of Nations — has recognized as a place of worship for Muslims alone, as well as the Bab Al-Rahma prayer hall and the Al-Buraq wall.@@@The occupying Power is also feverishly digging tunnels under and around the Al-Aqsa Mosque, threatening its collapse or partial collapse, which would lead to an explosion with untold consequences.@@@We have repeatedly warned against transforming the political conflict into a religious one, for which Israel will bear full responsibility.@@@I hereby call on the international community to assume its responsibilities in preserving the historical and legal status of Jerusalem and its sacred places, especially the Al-Aqsa Mosque, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and the Al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Al-Khalil/Hebron.@@@Here I wonder: Why remain silent about all the flagrant violations of international law that are being committed by Israel, the occupying Power?@@@Why is Israel not subjected to serious accountability?@@@Why are sanctions not imposed on it for ignoring and violating international resolutions, as is the case with other countries?@@@Why practice double standards when it comes to Israel?@@@Why accept that Israel is a State above the law?@@@Is it not time to answer those questions?@@@For our part, we will persist with our pursuit of accountability and justice before the relevant international bodies against Israel because of the continued Israeli occupation of our land and the crimes that have been committed and are still being committed against us, as well as against both Britain and the 
United States for their roles in the fateful Balfour Declaration — yes, the United States and Britain — and everyone who has had a role in the catastrophe and tragedy of our people.@@@We will not forget history and we will not forget miseries.@@@We call for acknowledgment, apology, reparations and compensation in accordance with international law.@@@In the light of the deadlock in the peace process due to Israel’s policies, we come to the General Assembly to appeal for the holding of an international peace conference — is that so difficult? — in which all countries concerned with achieving peace in the Middle East would participate.@@@I therefore ask the Organization and Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to take the necessary measures and call for the convening of that conference, which may be the last opportunity to salvage the two-State solution and to prevent the situation from deteriorating more seriously, threatening the security and stability of our region and the entire world.@@@I also call on the Organization and the Secretary- General to implement the resolutions pertaining to providing protection for the Palestinian people.@@@We demand protection from the constant aggressions of the occupation army and the terrorist Israeli settlers.@@@We call for support for our approach to the international courts and bodies with jurisdiction because the current situation is intolerable.@@@In the face of all that Israel is doing to systematically destroy the two-State solution, it has become necessary for me, in order to save that solution, to call on the States Members of the Organization, each State in its national capacity, to take practical steps on the basis of the relevant resolutions of international legitimacy and international law.@@@I also call on the States that have not yet recognized the State of Palestine to declare their recognition and for the State of Palestine to be admitted to full membership of the United Nations.@@@There are two States.@@@The entire world is talking about them.@@@The State of Israel is recognized by the entire world.@@@Why not the State of Palestine?@@@I can neither understand nor accept that some States, including the United States and European States, are reluctant to recognize the State of Palestine, which the United Nations has accepted as an observer State.@@@Those States confirm their support for the two- State solution every day, but they recognize only one of them, namely.@@@Israel.@@@Why?@@@What is the danger posed by the State of Palestine’s obtaining full membership in the United Nations?@@@Israel enjoys international recognition, although it has not adhered to the conditions for its accession to the United Nations, namely, the implementation of resolutions 181 (II) and 194 (III).@@@We therefore call on the Organization to take deterrent measures against Israel until it at least fulfils its obligations under a written declaration by its Minister for Foreign Affairs in 1949.@@@Moshe Sharett.@@@He issued a written commitment to implementing those resolutions at that time, but nothing has happened since then.@@@Our request is for the sake of peace and justice and out of respect for international law, international legitimacy and the Organization.@@@Our people are defending their homeland and their legitimate rights through peaceful popular resistance as a strategic option for self-defence, and to liberate the land from a settlement occupation that does not believe in peace and has no regard for the principles of truth, justice and human values.@@@We will continue our peaceful popular resistance to that brutal occupation until it withdraws from our land.@@@We are managing our affairs under extremely difficult and complex circumstances as a result of the restrictions that are being imposed on us by the occupying Power, which prevents us from accessing our natural resources, withholds our money for no just cause and continues its siege on our people in the Gaza Strip, with the consequent exacerbation of the suffering of our people.@@@Moreover.@@@Israel bears full responsibility, through its control over all the crossing points and dividing lines between the occupied West Bank and its surroundings, for the deliberate spread of weapons, drugs and criminal killings taking place in Arab cities inside Israel.@@@Every day sees a new murder, for which Israel is responsible.@@@Some of that violence is spilling over into our areas, posing a great threat to the societal security of Palestinians everywhere in our territory.@@@I must inform the Assembly that so long as we continue to suffer under the abhorrent Israeli occupation, we will continue to need financial assistance from the international community, in addition to the crucial provision of financial support to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, which is in dire need of assistance in supporting the refugees.@@@We are thankful to the international community for the support it has given us to build our State and our economy, and we look forward to the continuation of that support until the occupation ends.@@@If the international cooperation helps us get rid of the occupation, we will be able to rely on ourselves.@@@Our State institutions are engaged in a comprehensive development and reform process, and in that context they are cooperating with international institutions and with our partners in the region and the world.@@@We have recently held local elections and elections for institutions, federations, unions and others.@@@There is a specialized committee to develop the justice sector in Palestine.@@@Civil society is also playing its role in adding vitality to our political system.@@@All that remains for us is to hold democratic general elections, as we did in 1996.@@@2005 and 2006.@@@We have been unable to hold elections since then because the Israeli Government is obstructing them through its decision to prevent elections from being held in East Jerusalem.@@@The first three elections took place in East Jerusalem, but since then they have been prevented, despite the significant intervention of many countries, as well as regional and international organizations, to enable our Palestinian people in Jerusalem to vote and run in those elections.@@@Today we reiterate our rejection of any position holding us responsible for not convening those elections, which are a Palestinian necessity that we want today and not tomorrow.@@@We want elections, but we want them to be held in East Jerusalem.@@@Why does Israel prevent us from doing so?@@@Someone should ask it.@@@In the face of the intransigent position of the Israeli Government, we will continue to approach the relevant international bodies to hold the Israeli Government accountable and force it to allow us to hold the long overdue elections.@@@Last May.@@@I participated in the commemoration of the seventy-fifth anniversary of the 1948 Palestinian Nakba, a tragedy recognized by the Organization.@@@That painful anniversary continues to be ignored and denied by Israel, which is the first to be responsible for the Nakba.@@@I call on the Assembly today to criminalize the denial of the Nakba and to designate 15 May of each year as an international day to commemorate its anniversary in order to remember the lives of the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who were killed in massacres committed by Zionist gangs, whose villages were demolished and who were forcibly displaced from their homes.@@@The number of those refugees was 950.000 in 1948, constituting more than half of the Palestinian population at the time.@@@That is the least that the United Nations should do in honour of those victims and in condemnation of the human tragedy of the 1948 Nakba.@@@For several years, we have presented our Palestinian narrative and the story of our people, which has been deliberately distorted by the Zionist and Israeli propaganda.@@@We are relieved that the peoples of the world and many of its countries have begun to believe our narrative and sympathize with it after having been misled for decades.@@@We thank all those who contribute to sharing and supporting that narrative and all those who sympathize with it.@@@We also thank people of conscience everywhere in the world who today are standing up for Palestinian rights and supporting our people’s struggle for freedom and independence.@@@My message today to the Israelis is that the hideous occupation against us will not last regardless of their ambitions and delusions, because the Palestinian people are remaining on their land, which they have inhabited for thousands of years, generation after generation, as again confirmed by a recent UNESCO resolution regarding the city of Jericho, which has existed for 10.000 years.@@@The Palestinians cannot leave their land, and if anyone must leave it must be the occupiers.@@@We will stay in our land.@@@My message to the international community is that it should assume its responsibilities with full courage and implement its resolutions related to realizing Palestinian rights.@@@We ask for no more than our rights and the implementation of the relevant resolutions.@@@A thousand resolutions have been adopted.@@@We are asking the international community to implement just one.
Finally.@@@I address all of our people in Palestine, in the refugee camps, in the diaspora and in every place in this vast world, with the highest expressions of appreciation and gratitude for their steadfastness and insistence on upholding their rights.@@@I pay tribute to our righteous martyrs, our brave prisoners and our heroic injured people, and I say to everyone:@@@A right is never lost when there is a demand behind it.@@@Victory is ours, and we will celebrate the independence of our State in Jerusalem, our eternal capital, the crown jewel and flower of all cities.@@@They see it as far-fetched, and we see it as quite near.@@@The seventy-eighth session of the General Assembly, in which I am participating on behalf of my country, the Central African Republic, offers me the happy opportunity to reaffirm our inflexible determination to contribute to the search for solutions common to the challenges facing humankind.@@@I should like, from this rostrum, the symbol par excellence of human solidarity, to express the solidarity of the Central African people to the brotherly peoples of Morocco and Libya, hard hit by natural disasters that led to the loss of thousands of human lives and untold material damage a few days before the opening of this session.@@@As I have argued on other occasions, the tragic consequences of such natural disasters must drive home to the global scientific community the urgency of identifying regions of the world that are particularly vulnerable to extreme climatic events and of making available to the States concerned the information necessary to limit the damage.@@@Furthermore, the whole world has followed with deep dismay the mass arrival in recent days of thousands of African migrants on the island of Lampedusa.@@@Italy.@@@Those young people, who represent the present and the future of our continent.@@@Africa, are desperately seeking to reach the countries of the European continent in search of an Eldorado.@@@The escalation of the migrant crisis is one of the appalling consequences of the plundering of the natural resources of countries made poor by slavery, colonization.@@@Western imperialism, terrorism and internal armed conflicts, often waged 
against a backdrop of hegemonic aims and geopolitical and geostrategic tensions among the great world Powers.@@@While I deplore that dehumanizing phenomenon.@@@I salute the solidarity and incredible efforts of the host countries and the International Organization for Migration to provide assistance to those young people, whose lives are endangered by smugglers and the lawless sellers of illusions.@@@However, my country believes that the United Nations must go beyond our common commitment to reviving global solidarity by involving African countries in the search for global solutions to the migration crises and the existential challenges facing young people on the African continent.@@@As our countries continue to face climate shocks, geopolitical tensions and unprecedented financial, energy and food challenges, new global challenges arise every day.@@@Today, in Africa as elsewhere, conflicts — symptoms of the geopolitical and geostrategic tensions that divide the great Powers — are in full swing.@@@In the Sudan, an internal armed conflict of rare cruelty broke out in April, despite the fact that the country was on the path to normalization with a promising process of dialogue among all the active forces of the nation.@@@The Central African Republic has already registered 51.077 Sudanese and Chadian refugees in Vakaga prefecture, exposing our assuredly resilient populations to the potential exacerbation of our still precarious humanitarian situation and insecurity.@@@I call for consideration of the impact of the crisis on regional geopolitics, as well as international solidarity in favour of refugees.@@@As we meet here, the Russo-Ukrainian conflict continues on the ground, with no prospect for a peaceful settlement, while the consequences for the world are painful and regrettable.@@@The persistence and multiplication of hotbeds of tension throughout the world raise questions about the effectiveness of certain mechanisms for the prevention and peaceful resolution of disputes deployed by the United Nations, whose primary mission is to guarantee international peace and security.@@@That is why we strongly reaffirm the Common African Position on Security Council reform in order to increase the number of permanent and non-permanent members and to grant a permanent seat to Africa.@@@That can only serve the interests of justice.@@@The Central African Republic believes that it is urgent to remediate the historical injustices suffered by Africa, in view of the important agendas ahead, such as the Summit of the Future in 2024 and the eightieth anniversary of the United Nations in 2025, which could be opportunities to unite Member States in order to take concrete measures for said reform.@@@The Central African Republic wonders how we can accelerate the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in favour of peace, prosperity, progress and sustainability for all, when certain States, from the height of their political, economic and military power, constantly use coercive diplomacy or exploit international financial institutions for the purpose of imposing economic, financial and commercial blockades against countries impoverished by slavery, colonization and imperialism?@@@Indeed, on 29 July, the Central African people learned with great dismay of the renewal of the arms embargo, motivated by inadequate reports and rationales, with a false exemption for the national security forces.@@@Before the world, the Central African Republic denounces that cynical decision, which betrays the unacknowledged intention of the members of the Council that voted for it to exploit the sanctions regimes for the purposes of political pressure, under the aegis of the United Nations.@@@I recall and deplore the fact that the embargoes on arms and diamonds, maintained for 10 years and now compounded by the suspension of budgetary support, constitute real obstacles to the achievement by my country of the objectives of the 2030 Agenda.@@@We reject that denial of our right to self-determination and permanent sovereignty over our natural wealth and resources, guaranteed by the relevant legal instruments of the United Nation.@@@I urge the Security Council to put an end to those machinations, which are aimed at masking the desire to perpetuate insecurity and control over my country’s natural resources for the benefit of foreign Powers, legitimize armed groups and grant them status under international law.@@@Our planet is burning; our planet is drowning; the world is collapsing; the world weeps.@@@Yes, every day the media announce natural disasters linked to climate change, which come as warning signs of the apocalypse.@@@Paradoxically, trust and solidarity among nations, the founding values of the United Nations, are further fractured, thereby impeding the human community from achieving the noble objectives of sustainable development in favour of peace, prosperity, progress and sustainability for all provided for in the 2030 Agenda.@@@And yet, in order to restore confidence and revive solidarity in the face of devastating climate phenomena, commitments have been made by developed countries, the major polluters, from the Paris Agreement on Climate Change to the agreements struck in Glasgow and Sharm El-Sheikh.@@@Egypt.@@@The twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, in particular, usefully set four major objectives that we have all adopted — mitigation, adaptation, financing and a just transition — in order to meet the common challenges facing humankind.@@@Unfortunately, many countries, including the Central African Republic, innocent victims of the dramatic consequences of the overexploitation of the planet by developed countries, do not benefit from the funding promises made.@@@We appreciate the true value of the contribution of bilateral and multilateral partners alike in their surge of solidarity towards Africa, our continent, and thank them infinitely.@@@However, we call for a more active, evolving and diversified partnership, respectful of the sovereignty of States and the cultural and moral values of all.@@@Only in that way can we rekindle the flame of friendship among peoples, promote peace and security and create the conditions for equitable and inclusive development.@@@My country continues to advocate for inclusive multilateralism, mutually accelerated growth and a balanced world order and for global disputes to be addressed with particular emphasis on international peace and security and respect for the sovereignty of each State.@@@I take this opportunity to denounce all the disinformation and denigration campaigns carried out by certain Western media against the Central African Republic.@@@I reaffirm here the determination of my country to diversify its international cooperation with all the countries that so desire, in the sole vital interests of its people, and to avoid being drawn into competitions between world Powers.@@@By adopting by referendum, on 30 July, the new Constitution of the Central African Republic, by an overwhelming majority of 95.3 per cent and with a participation rate of more than 57 per cent, the Central African people have just reaffirmed their attachment to the goals and principles set out in the Charter of the United Nations and its inalienable right to respect for its sovereignty, self-determination, the stability of its institutions, peace, security, national unity and development.@@@To accelerate the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals in favour of peace, prosperity, progress and sustainability for all, the Government is pursing the implementation of the Political Agreement for Peace and Reconciliation in the Central African Republic and the Luanda Joint Roadmap for Peace in the Central African Republic and is investing in strengthening the commitment of all stakeholders.@@@As part of the implementation of those peace and national security instruments, nine armed groups have already been dissolved.@@@At the same time, the Special Criminal Court and the ordinary courts independently continue the fight against impunity.@@@I recall that, beyond the Constitution, our national policy of decentralization is both a deep aspiration of the Central African people and an essential component of the Peace Agreement and the Luanda Joint Roadmap.@@@I highlight all the efforts already undertaken by the National Elections Authority with the support of international technical assistance, which have allowed us to reassess the electoral calendar, which now provides for the holding of local elections for the month of October 2024.@@@For us, that is a fundamental step in our march towards the local anchoring of democracy, the promotion of participatory governance and local development.@@@That is why we want those local elections to be inclusive, transparent, peaceful and credible.@@@I urge all our partners to support the Government in completing the electoral process, which is well under way.@@@To begin.@@@I would like to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Dennis Francis on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session.@@@Our debate is timely and very relevant to the current global context, as its theme is “Rebuilding trust and reigniting global solidarity: accelerating action on the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals towards peace, prosperity, progress and sustainability for all”.@@@It is my great pleasure to address this gathering today as the new Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Cambodia.@@@I am committed to working closely with all Member States within this body of the United Nations to realize our shared aspirations.@@@I share the prevailing concerns over the growing global instability and geopolitical tensions that we are all witnessing at present.@@@The escalation of the war in Ukraine — and its grave consequences — reflect a significant erosion of trust among Member States and a lack of confidence in multilateralism.@@@The competition between super- and major Powers has diverted available resources to expand security capabilities amid widening gaps in funding to address the lingering effect of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@Climate change, meanwhile, is threatening the existence of humankind.@@@Without bold and urgent action on our part, the world will see further increases in poverty, hunger and the risk of pandemics, as well as more entrenched cycles of instability and conflict.@@@It is high time to restore strategic security trust among all nations and trust in the rules-based global system, in which all States fully respect international laws and norms as well as the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.@@@We should strengthen and leverage the convening power of the United Nations system to help reignite global solidarity so as to build a safer and more prosperous world for all.@@@First and foremost, we must more strongly emphasize the need to address development issues and prevent existing conflicts from widening.@@@In that regard.@@@Cambodia highly appreciates the Secretary-General’s New Agenda for Peace, with its ambitious recommendations for global stability, and his vision for the future of global cooperation as outlined in his report entitled Our Common Agenda (A/75/982).@@@We strongly support his initiatives with respect to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the climate.@@@I am confident that his call for an SDG Stimulus — to invest $500 billion a year in sustainable development and climate action between now and 2030 — will put the progress on SDG implementation back on track.@@@The climate solidarity pact that he proposed will lead to a reduction of emissions in line with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities.@@@With enduring peace and stability.@@@Cambodia continues to make notable progress on every front.@@@Over the past two decades, poverty has fallen steadily, at an average annual rate of 1.6 per cent.@@@Our economy grew by more than 7 per cent a year until COVID-19 broke out.@@@We were hailed as one of the most successful countries in controlling the pandemic and recovering from its impact.@@@Economic growth returned to 5.2 per cent in 2022 and is expected to continue growing at 5.6 percent in 2023.@@@As highlighted in our second voluntary national review, in July.@@@72.5 per cent of Cambodia’s SDG indicators and sub-indicators are well on track.@@@The country is steadily transitioning from least developed to developing country status, in 2027.@@@That is thanks to sound Government policies and our ability to maintain peace, political stability, high economic growth, equitable distribution of benefits from growth and forging good cooperation with all stakeholders.@@@Our democracy-building process has steadily advanced.@@@In July.@@@Cambodia successfully held general elections, with 18 political parties contesting.@@@More than 8.2 million people cast their ballots — a turnout rate of 84.59 per cent.@@@That is the highest since the United Nations-supervised elections in 1993 and a clear indication of our people’s greater political maturity and enthusiasm in exercising their democratic rights.@@@The election has been widely assessed as free, fair, credible and just by thousands of observers, including 333 from abroad representing 65 countries.@@@Like many developing countries.@@@Cambodia has a lot more to do to reach our goal of becoming an upper middle-income country by 2030 and a resilient, vibrant and prosperous high-income country by 2050.@@@To that end, and in line with the Secretary-General’s call for Member States to deliver a “Rescue Plan for People and Planet”, my Government is committed to taking transformative actions through our recently launched Pentagonal Strategy for Cambodia’s socioeconomic development over the next 25 years.@@@The Pentagonal Strategy is being implemented from phase I in the five areas of growth, employment, equity, efficiency and sustainability.@@@The five key priorities are people, roads, water, electricity and technology — especially digital technology, to address the fourth industrial revolution and the digital transformation of Cambodia’s economy.@@@I would like to add that the main objectives of the strategy include, on the one hand, maintaining the positive momentum of peace, economic growth and development in general and, on the other, building and strengthening the foundations necessary to accelerate national development through resilience in five areas — the public sector, the economy, the financial sector, human and social capital, and the environment, including climate change response.@@@For the success of the Pentagonal Strategy.@@@Cambodia will accelerate its governance reforms to ensure that our public administration runs efficiently with a high level of integrity.@@@We will safeguard peace, political stability, security and the social order, and maintain macroeconomic stability.@@@To that end.@@@Cambodia will further enhance partnerships and cooperation for development and keep welcoming the support of all friendly partners, both technical and financial, to help Cambodia achieve its SDGs while continuing to deepen its regional and global integration.@@@Cambodia will continue on its present path of an independent and neutral foreign policy, based on the rule of law, equal mutual respect and adherence to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, to promote its national interests, strengthen existing friendships and build more amicable ties.@@@Cambodia remains resolute against the threat or use of force in international relations, interference in the internal affairs of and aggression against other independent nations.@@@Cambodia will not authorize any foreign military base on its territory, as clearly stated in its Constitution.@@@Cambodia will not allow any country or any group to use its territory against another country.@@@Cambodia will further endeavour to strengthen and expand good cooperation with 
nations around the world through bilateral, regional and international frameworks to contribute to global peace, security, stability, sustainable development and prosperity shared by all.@@@In addition to the SDGs under the global framework.@@@Cambodia has added its own specific goal related to mine action — namely, a “Mine-Free Cambodia by 2025”.@@@In that effort, we call for continued financial and technical support.@@@We also urge greater participation by the international community to raise awareness of the dangers of landmines and unexploded ordnance, the hidden killers that threaten human security even after armed conflicts end.@@@Cambodia welcomes the Global Accelerator on Jobs and Social Protection for Just Transitions, initiated by Antonio Guterres.@@@We are proud to have been selected as one of the 10 potential pathfinder countries.@@@To achieve the SDGs.@@@Cambodia calls on the international community to intensify efforts, strengthen cooperation and rebuild trust and confidence to end wars, address the root causes of conflicts and reinvigorate solidarity for the achievement of the Goals.@@@As a troop-contributing country.@@@Cambodia fully supports increasing the portion of official development assistance for peace-building.@@@Cambodia remains steadfast in its commitment to peacekeeping operations in contributing to international peace, security and stability, which are crucial to sustainable development.@@@To further contribute to that process.@@@Cambodia has decided to stand for membership of the Organizational Committee of the Peace-building Commission for the term 2025 to 2026.@@@We seek the invaluable support of members for our candidature to that body.@@@In conclusion, despite the many challenges and the prevailing instability, we can build a better world for all by working together towards our common goals with reinforced mutual trust and global solidarity.@@@Cambodia fully supports the adoption of the SDG Summit political declaration and the draft decision of the Summit of the Future.@@@Those documents will help keep progress towards the SDGs on track and ensure their achievement by 2030.@@@One week ago.@@@I was in Santiago de Chile for the commemoration of the 50 years that had passed since the homicidal and bloody coup against President Salvador Allende.@@@From there I went to my country, a poor neighbourhood of Medellin, where in the past the mafia would lure young people with the possibility of learning computer programming.@@@I then went to Havana, an unjustly blockaded country whose inclusion on the list of terrorist-sponsoring countries for the simple reason of helping to make peace in Colombia was suggested and accomplished by the President of my country.@@@And now I am here to address the General Assembly.@@@Over the year that has passed since my previous address at the United Nations (see A/77/PV.4), we have seen only a deepening of what the wealthy Davos meeting participants call a polycrisis.@@@War continues.@@@Hunger continues.@@@The recession is increasing.@@@And the climate crisis is showing its teeth, claiming thousands of lives and heating land and sea as never before.@@@This has been a year of loss for humankind, which is hastening on and marching steadily towards the era of extinction.@@@All those crises are in fact just one crisis: the crisis of life.@@@It seems that world leaders have become the enemies of life.@@@The crisis of life is being expressed in one devastating indicator.@@@It began at the furthest corners of the Earth, far from the most remote regions.@@@It is a silent march of people of different cultures who are mingling on their way like an infinitely nuanced painting.@@@The colours are mixing together in an uncontainable stream.@@@A multitude of all the colours is moving along trails and through the seas and jungles.@@@They make a kind of work of art on the canvas of the Earth, a flow of tones, sounds, a mixture of clothes and cultures in an amalgam that remembers its beginnings.@@@It is an amalgam in a great march from the South to the North.@@@The human exodus has begun.@@@Today there are tens of millions.@@@Tomorrow — by 2070, according to scientific experts — the figure will have reached 3 billion.@@@That is 3 billion people fleeing their beloved homes because those homes will be uninhabitable.@@@In my homeland.@@@Colombia, the country of beauty, the country of an explosion of life, only deserts will remain by 2070.@@@The people will go to the North, no longer attracted by the glitter of wealth but by something simpler and more vital — water.@@@Since the early stages of humankind, people have gone to where water is, to the North.@@@Billions of people will defy armies and will change the Earth to do that.@@@The exodus of the peoples to the North is an exact reflection of the dimension of the failure of Governments.@@@This past year has been a time of defeat for Governments, a defeat for humankind.@@@The exodus across borders has increased.@@@Dogs and hounds have been set on immigrants.@@@People have been put on horseback to pursue them, with whips in their hands, with restraints and chains.@@@They have built prisons.@@@So much has hatred grown for the foreign, the strange, that prisons have even been built at sea so that men and women of the South do not set foot on the land of white people, who still believe themselves to be a superior race and who, nostalgic for that, recall at their elections a leader who has even said so and who killed millions as a result.@@@The exodus has increased over this past year, showing how much the crisis of life is advancing.@@@But while the clock ticks away the minutes that define life or death on our planet, instead of sitting down and taking the time to discuss how to defend life and then using our increased knowledge to expand life in our universe, we decide to waste our time killing one another.@@@We are not thinking about how to expand life in the stars, but how to end it on our planet.@@@We have devoted ourselves to war.@@@We have been called to war.@@@Latin America has been called on to deliver machinery and men to go to the battlefields.@@@They forgot that our countries were invaded several times by the same people who today talk about fighting against invasions.@@@They forgot that Iraq.@@@Syria and Libya were invaded for oil.@@@They forgot that the same reasons that are advanced to defend Zelenskyy are the same reasons that should be used to defend Palestine.@@@They forgot that, to meet the Sustainable Development Goals, all wars must be brought to an end.@@@But they helped to start one because it was convenient for world Powers in their game of 
thrones, in their hunger games, and they forgot to end the other war because it was not convenient for them.@@@What is the difference.@@@I ask, between Ukraine and Palestine?@@@Is it not time to end both wars, and others, and to make the most of the short time we have to build pathways to save life on the planet?@@@As President of Colombia, the country of beauty, whom a group within humankind — comprising millions of workers, women from working-class neighbourhoods.@@@Indigenous and Black people, people from the countryside, young people of all colours — decided to elect and send to speak here before the Assembly.@@@I propose to end the war so that we have time to save ourselves.@@@I propose that the United Nations convene two peace conferences as soon as possible, one on Ukraine and the other on Palestine, not because there are no other wars in the world, as in my country, but because it would show how to build peace in all regions of the planet, because both — and only both — would put an end to hypocrisy as a political practice, because we could be sincere, a virtue without which we cannot be warriors for life.@@@Today’s generation must decide and act as soon as possible to overcome the enormous hurricane that has been unleashed against life, from the dark but powerful sewers of greed, from the hurricane of capital that only looks at profit and that has engulfed the planet and the very basis of existence.@@@I propose that we end the war in order to defend life from the climate crisis, the mother of all crises.@@@The Summit that we have just held was designed to assess the targets of the Sustainable Development Goals, which were set by Governments for 2030.@@@Well, it is easy to make that assessment.@@@Those human development goals are not going to be achieved.@@@We are far from achieving them — in fact, we have regressed.@@@To give the United Nations human development goals a simpler name.@@@I would call them social and environmental justice.@@@Humankind will not achieve social justice by 2030, because what has been sown on our planet is injustice.@@@What we have seen happening in the past few years is injustice, the injustice of turning a vaccine against a deadly disease into a commodity by hoarding it in rich countries.@@@Latin America — a mere 8 per cent of the world’s population — accounted for 26 per cent of coronavirus disease deaths.@@@Who said that health must be a business and not a right?@@@Millions of elderly people and millions generally died because the vaccine was a commodity and not a good of humankind.@@@Those rich countries have failed to deliver on their own promise to finance climate change adaptation.@@@They do not have $100 billion to give to countries to protect them from floods, storms and hurricanes, but they do have it to spend in a single day to enable Russians and Ukrainians to kill each other.@@@At this point we do not need $100 billion — we need $3 trillion to overcome the climate crisis, and the bill is rising with every second that passes on Earth.@@@Injustice has been sown, and by arresting peasant farmers who grow cannabis and coca leaf instead of addressing the loneliness faced by the young in the countries with the greatest economic and military power in the history of humankind, those young people have turned to fentanyl, the drug of death.@@@Those countries wanted a war against the drugs of choice of the rebellious youth who opposed the Viet Nam War, the hippies’ marijuana and LSD.@@@They ended up leading their society to the drug of neoliberalism and competition, the drug of choice of Manhattan yuppies — cocaine — and locked up millions of blacks and Latinos in cold, privatized prisons.@@@A million Latin Americans were murdered and democracies destroyed in our America.@@@They never managed to jail the Manhattan yuppies, and now they are faced with the glorious result of drug prohibition, fentanyl, which kills not 4.000 but 100.000 young people a year in the United States.@@@Injustices were sown, with the worst of them all condemning humankind to war.@@@That is why social justice in the world today is in such a bad state.@@@The problem is that this was not a question of whether we might be socialists or progressives, but rather one of determining where the time left to live on the planet was going.@@@As President of a land of beauty.@@@I propose to the General Assembly that we do two simple things to make up for lost time — end the war and reform the global financial system.@@@From the peace conferences on Ukraine and Palestine, we should go out and build the reform that we already discussed back there, in the Amazon jungle, where the largest river on Earth, which crosses the largest jungle on Earth, meets the sea.@@@We have discussed it in Brasilia, and we have been to Kenya to join our brother peoples of black Africa, from whence we came at a time of another great injustice perpetrated by the powerful — slavery.@@@We have been to Paris to see if crowds are still clamouring for liberty, equality and fraternity, and we have been to Washington to talk to the President and see if the peoples of North and South America might come together again, remembering that 
in days of old, more than two centuries ago, we met in history to talk about liberty, equality, democracy and the Republic.@@@And we have talked in every tone of voice about getting to the root of the problem of and resolving the climate crisis.@@@If fossil capitalism is not financed, it will die.@@@Its death throes will be harsh, but that is necessary if humankind, nature and life are to continue to exist.@@@Decarbonized capitalism will have to be financed — we already know that green capital will move only where there is profit.@@@That is its law, and that framework for covering the decarbonization of the entire world is a narrow one.@@@Those in Government and power who still believe that the climate crisis, the crisis of life itself, can be overcome with a few affordable credits are mistaken.@@@In their delusion, they propose that countries of the Earth that are already over-indebted by disease and greed can acquire more credits in order to overcome a problem created solely by the smokestacks of the North.@@@But the crisis of life, the mega-crisis, cannot be overcome by acquiring more debt.@@@The financing of life is the intravenous medicine that must be infused into the veins of the economies and societies of the world to tackle the challenge of leaving coal and oil under the earth, in their places, which are the true veins of the Earth, as Roberto Cobaria, a Colombian Uwa indigenous person, told the world 30 years ago.@@@In his words, extracting oil is drawing blood from the Earth, and doing it will cause life to perish.@@@Most of the investment in decarbonizing the world’s economy will come from public funds, from societal efforts, by bringing States together to bring humankind together — what is now known as multilateralism — to govern the Earth through the lens of democracy rather than the lens of empire.@@@Empires excel not at saving life but at starting wars.@@@The mega-crisis of life can be resolved through a democracy with global reach, a deeper democracy that should not hesitate to define States and societies and formulate a great Marshall Plan for the revitalization of the planet.@@@The market will help us somewhat, but we cannot ask a mechanism devoid of humanity for solutions to a problem that it created to begin with.@@@Yes, private funds can help, but they will be limited by their own logic.@@@It is public funds that will have to bear the brunt of the effort, and those funds are presently weakened by debt.@@@The great battle of our generation, that of defending life for our children and grandchildren, can be fully financed only by the public sector, by all of us — freeing the public sector to save life.@@@Many may not like it, but we must let the echo of the public, of the State, of humankind, of multilateralism resound once more — that is to say, let the word “change” resound because it will be crucial if we are to save life.@@@Saving life requires an era of change, and it is urgent.@@@Today change is synonymous with life.@@@Today, in order to live, young people of all colours must bear the standard of change, of transformation, of a new humankind.@@@It is democracy, not authoritarianisms, that increasingly resembles Nazis.@@@It is world democracy, it is planning, it is the power of States, this time facing not war but how to plan life.@@@It entails planning the transition to a decarbonized economy and financing it.@@@The decarbonized economy.@@@I have no doubt, will be a more humane and just economy.@@@That is why the President of the land of beauty proposes that we reform the global financial system, the International Monetary Fund and the multilateral banking system, end economic blockades and channel private equity funds.@@@If the debt of all countries were reduced by paying what is owed to the lenders through the allocation of special drawing rights by the IMF, there would be a decrease in global public debt and a real increase in public budgets and funds.@@@In that way, we would be able to finance a Marshall Plan for the Sustainable Development Goals and for social and environmental justice on the planet, a plan to overcome, mitigate and adapt to the climate crisis, which is the crisis of life.@@@This would be to restore Keynes from oblivion.@@@That wise old man, and other wise men before him, equally forgotten, had already said as much in the depth of their ideas.@@@What a beautiful horizon amid the darkness and storms of today — a horizon that tastes of hope.@@@The goals of life and justice can be reached on the path that leads to global democracy and the reassessment of the common good, achieved along a pathway that belongs to everyone.@@@I want my baby grandchildren.@@@Luna.@@@Victoria and Luka, and my younger daughter.@@@Antonella, to be able to live far from the apocalypse and the times of extinction.@@@I want them to live in a time in which humans learned how to stop killing each other on the planet and, through the diversity of their cultures, succeeded in understanding each other and fulfilling their mission to spread the virus of life among the stars of the universe.@@@I come from Peru, a country with a vast history and cultural wealth, which has been the cradle of civilization in our America, and whose leadership I assumed with firmness and courage on 7 December 2022, facing a coup d’etat in the midst of a political and social crisis that we have been able to overcome within the framework of our Constitution.@@@Today, as I have the honour of being the first constitutional female President of the Republic in the 201 years of its existence, and of leading my country’s delegation to the General Assembly.@@@I am grateful for the recognition of the international community.@@@Peru is once again on the world stage alongside the people of the world.@@@I am a provincial woman, a Quechua speaker born in the heights of the southern Peruvian Andes, and I lead a Government that, within the framework of the law and in the face of difficult challenges, both from nature and on the international stage, has restored stability and hope to a country that seeks economic development with social justice.@@@First of all, this message serves to pay well-deserved tribute to women, girls and adolescents, especially Peruvian women.@@@As we say in Quechua.@@@Amana warmi maqay kachunchu.@@@I tell the world: No more violence against women.@@@Peru is a country that respects democracy, the rule of law, human rights and international law.@@@That is why it actively promotes Latin American integration and is firmly committed to cooperation among countries.@@@Peru promotes peace, and to achieve that peace it is necessary to apply the Charter of the United Nations in all circumstances.@@@For that reason, we reaffirm and defend the principle of respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of all States.@@@As a daughter of the southern Andean region of my country.@@@I have known first-hand the suffering caused by poverty.@@@Therefore.@@@I am fully aware that, as we reaffirmed in the political declaration we adopted yesterday.@@@“eradicating poverty. .@@@, is the greatest global challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development” (A/HLPF/2023/L.1, para. 3).@@@That is the main objective of my Government, and that is why we are committed to the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@Today in this forum.@@@I want to reaffirm Peru’s voice so that the international community gives the highest priority to eradicating poverty.@@@It is a commitment that we cannot and must not abandon.@@@In Peru, we are adopting policies to confront not only monetary poverty but also multidimensional poverty, promoting, among other important actions, access to drinking water and basic sanitation.@@@In nine months of management, we have unblocked more than 100 paralysed projects, which will provide water to the sisters and brothers of my country.@@@The crises caused by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, climate change, growing geopolitical tensions, armed conflicts and increased food prices are overwhelming our people and have stymied our potential for growth and development.@@@If those trends continue, as Secretary-General Antonio Guterres tells us, almost 600 million people will continue to live in extreme poverty in 2030, and only a third of countries will reach the goal of halving their national poverty levels.@@@We cannot accept that scenario.@@@The time has come — either we progress together, or we condemn ourselves as a whole.@@@United, everything; disunited, we all lose.@@@That brings us to a next challenge.@@@Our development agenda has the motto Man an pitapas qipapi saqispa, which in our Quechua means “leaving no one behind”.@@@However, today millions of human beings move, sometimes literally, carrying their families and their scant belongings, in search of well-being or simply survival, in the face of conflict, unemployment and extreme poverty.@@@The current situation of human mobility requires bilateral, regional and multilateral 
cooperation.@@@In that regard.@@@Peru has been making enormous efforts, but it will be only through international cooperation that we will be able to achieve safe, orderly and regular migration.@@@Health has already shown us that it is a problem not for a mere few, but for everyone.@@@My country was one of the hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, which claimed the lives of more than 200.000 compatriots and revealed the gaps and shortcomings of our health system.@@@This year, we have faced resurgences of the dengue, measles and polio epidemics, as well as the outbreak of Guillain-Barre syndrome.@@@My Government is therefore firmly committed to guaranteeing access to comprehensive health care, free and universal to all, without exception.@@@To achieve that, we are improving the coverage of the national vaccine scheme and reinforcing health infrastructure and equipment.@@@We have been able to vaccinate more than 1.900.000 girls and boys, from the ages of two months to five years, against polio and measles, and we continue tirelessly to unblock hospital projects paralysed by apathy and corruption, which is another scourge besetting my country.@@@In addition, we have made the prevention and treatment of cancer a national objective and twenty of the twenty-six regions of Peru now have at least one oncological service.@@@It is possible to work when the political will is there.@@@In those areas, international cooperation must ensure quality health goods and services accessible to all, and mainly for developing countries, where the gaps are much wider.@@@In Peru, we observe with concern the growing internationalization of criminal networks fuelled by the corruption of past Governments, which have undermined the credibility of institutions and democracy, affecting the development and well-being of our citizens.@@@It is therefore urgent to reinforce our joint work.@@@We cannot let our guard down against crime, organized crime and drug trafficking.@@@Those problems affect us all and we must all be part of the solution.@@@Our children and grandchildren are at risk of experiencing the hell that a triple environmental crisis would bring, now that we are entering the era of “global boiling”, as the Secretary-General has called it.@@@Climate change, the loss of biodiversity and pollution are putting our very existence as humankind at risk.@@@In Peru, we are facing it with a sense of urgency and determination.@@@Early in the year, heavy rains affected northern Peru, which were followed by the onslaught of Cyclone Yaku.@@@In the south, droughts and frosts seriously harmed people, agriculture and livestock, added to recurring anomalous waves in the Pacific, which hinder the regular operations of our fishing ports.@@@Finally, we have the growing threat of the coastal El Nino phenomenon, which will be followed by the impact of the global El Nino.@@@An action approach with preventive measures is urgently needed.@@@Therefore, from this high rostrum.@@@I call for solidarity and international cooperation.@@@For the first time, an administration in my country has undertaken a major action campaign against global El Nino with an investment of 4 billion soles, equivalent to more than $1 billion.@@@We have also joined the Early Alerts for All initiative, presented by the Secretary-General, so that, by the end of 2027, all the inhabitants of the planet will be protected against meteorological phenomena.@@@That will save many lives.@@@In addition.@@@I allow myself today to propose a pact, a commitment to cooperation and international action for immediate attention to the impact of meteorological phenomena such as El Nino; a pact based on solidarity, resilience and interdependence.@@@Today it is Peru that has to face El Nino; tomorrow nature may be cruel to another destiny, but in unity, as we always say in my country, we can move forward.@@@Let us make this pact a pact for the world, a pact for life!@@@Developing countries have made progress in reducing carbon emissions, but we continue to be the most affected by climate disasters.@@@Last month, the eight Amazonian countries held a presidential summit, at which we agreed on measures for the conservation and sustainable use of the Amazon, the fight against deforestation and urgent action to avoid the point of no return.@@@There.@@@Peru presented its vision of the Amazon with a human face — “with a human face” because the Amazon, which constitutes 61 per cent of Peru’s surface, is not a sanctuary occupied solely by nature.@@@It is home to almost 5 million Peruvians.@@@It is still possible to limit the increase in global temperature to within 1.5°C, as we proposed in the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, but strong actions will be necessary.@@@That will require developed countries not only to adopt more ambitious emissions reduction goals, but also to honour their commitments in technology transfer and climate financing.@@@Today more than ever, it is urgent to mobilize the $100 billion annually that have been committed to climate action 
in developing countries, as well as to establish the loss and damage fund agreed upon at the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.@@@Here at United Nations Headquarters.@@@I wish to report that the Peruvian presidency has already delivered a draft agreement aimed at protecting the marine environment against plastic pollution.@@@In my country.@@@48 indigenous languages are spoken, and more than 6 million citizens identify themselves as members of one of the indigenous or native peoples of Peru, and more than 800.000 as Afro- Peruvians.@@@Promoting the full exercise of their rights is a challenge that we share with many countries, and our essential task is to continue seeking their inclusion and well-being, providing them with quality services and promoting respect for their rights, their cultures and their languages.@@@On the verge of commemorating the bicentennial of our consolidation as an independent Republic.@@@Peru renews its commitment to continuing to contribute to peace, international development and care for the environment.@@@We have done so during our presidency of the Andean Community, we are doing so in the Pacific Alliance, and we will continue to do so next year as President of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum.@@@We remain firm in our process of accession to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and in our participation in the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity, and we have begun our approach to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations with a view to being partners in development.@@@I therefore reiterate my invitation to all countries and their economies to continue investing and trusting in Peru.@@@Peru is a country of hope.@@@In my country, we await partners with clear and transparent rules of the game, with stability and legal security, with low inflation, with solid international reserves and with the sole objective of working for the sustained growth of all, but especially of the most vulnerable.@@@The Government of Peru, faithful to its commitment to the United Nations linked to its republican tradition, joins with determination and firmness the global purpose to consolidate the global fight against climate change and to defend peace, democracy, unrestricted respect for human rights, international law, sustainable development and the prosperity to which our peoples aspire, as it is based on justice.@@@Kuska Uancasum, huk sonccollay, huk umalla, huk miinaylla, which means.@@@“Let us work together, with one heart, one thought and one desire”.@@@I congratulate President Francis on the occasion of the opening of the seventy-eighth session of the General Assembly.@@@Since last year, when I addressed everyone from this rostrum (see A/77/PV.6), the world has witnessed bitter as well as sweet events, but nearly eight decades following the establishment of the United Nations, the new session of the General Assembly is beginning as the world is experiencing unprecedented and historic changes.@@@Meanwhile, the assurance of a luminous future for human society lies in the devoted observance of lofty virtues that guide people towards excellence and noble ideals.@@@What better source is there than the word of the Creator to encapsulate the essence of humanity and elevate the inherent values of humankind?@@@The Holy Quran beckons humankind towards rationality, spirituality, truth and justice.@@@It expounds upon the unity of humankind, embracing all earthly inhabitants.@@@It seeks to guide all towards human dignity, which will lead to the blessings sought by humankind.@@@What has the Holy Quran said to infuriate and focus the attention of those who seek power and hold the reins of power?@@@The Holy Quran says that humans do not accept oppression and that in their pursuit against it they will be able to attain elevated divine values.@@@The Holy Quran speaks of equality among humans.@@@It says that they were all created equally from a single mother and father.@@@Even though there are natural differences between men and women, the Holy Quran sees them as completing one another and equal in the eyes of the Creator.@@@The Holy Quran defends the sanctity of the family and sees children as gifts entrusted to us by God.@@@Moreover, the Holy Quran calls on us to serve those who have less than we do and directs our beliefs and faith to recognize the sanctity of those values.@@@Is this the first time that the words of God the Omnipotent have been burned by those who presume that, while they do so, they can extinguish the divine voice for eternity?@@@Did Nimrod.@@@Pharaoh or Caesar triumph over Abraham.@@@Moses and Jesus?@@@The Holy Quran forbids all forms of violence in human interactions and deems respect towards Abraham.@@@Moses and Jesus on a par with and equal to the sanctity of the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him.@@@Those understandings, which bring unity and divine teachings that inspire and build human character, societies and progress for human societies will never be burned.@@@They are eternal.@@@They remain impervious.@@@The fires of disrespect will not overcome the divine truth.@@@Islamophobia and the cultural apartheid witnessed in Western countries, and evident in actions ranging from the desecration of the Holy Quran to the banning of hijabs in schools and numerous other deplorable discriminations, are not worthy of human dignity.@@@Even more concerning is the fact that, behind the scenes, there seems to be an agenda that seeks to divert attention by using the tool of freedom of speech.@@@As one Westerner has said, now that the West is faced with a crisis of identity, it sees the world as a jungle and presents itself in the best of lights as a beautiful garden.@@@Some powerful interests see that fabrication as their tool of choice.@@@That apartheid has targeted the Muslim community, particularly immigrants, who are themselves victims of colonial policies.@@@In alignment with all adherents of faith and advocates for freedom, we firmly believe that reverence for religions should hold a prominent position on the United Nations agenda in order to inculcate the proper framework of respect for all world religions.@@@Concurrently with the war on Islam, we are also seeing a war against the institution of the family.@@@The family is the most fundamental column supporting human development, which is now under attack.@@@Today crimes against humanity include not just the occupation of lands, the oppression of peoples and mass killings, but also a concerted attack on the family itself.@@@That, too, is a crime against humanity.@@@The protection of the nucleus of the family, which is the sanctity of marriage between a man and a woman, is an inherent truth to be accepted by the entire world.@@@The proper education of populations throughout the world will not yield the desired results unless it is undertaken within the framework of the family.@@@“Mother”, “father” and “family” are divine and natural words and concepts.@@@We are seeing actions that can be viewed as seeking the end of the human race itself.@@@We are today in need of a world movement that ensures commitment to the survival of the framework of the family, so that all family members can experience life in peace and stability side by side We therefore ask all religious leaders to assume their historical responsibilities in defending the sanctity of the family and to move against fabrications.@@@We expect the United Nations to give this issue very high priority on its agenda and to offer the proper protection to the framework of the family.@@@We find ourselves at a critical juncture in history.@@@The global landscape is also undergoing a paradigm shift towards an emerging international order.@@@That trajectory is not reversible.@@@The equation attributed to the hegemony of the West no longer resonates with the diverse realities of today’s world.@@@The old liberal order, catering to the ambitions of voracious rulers and capitalists whose hunger has no end, has been relegated to obsolescence.@@@In short, efforts to universalize American ideals throughout the world have proven to be a failure.@@@The Iranian nation takes pride in having instrumentally unmasked the true nature of the rulers in both the East and the West through its Islamic revolution.@@@In conjunction with other nations of West Asia.@@@Iran has played a significant role in defeating the global arrogance.@@@Now, nations throughout the world are engaged in heightened resistance and awareness.@@@As non-Western Powers have emerged, there is collective hope for the establishment of a novel and equitable world order.@@@Central to the coming international order is the abandonment of global arrogance in favour of regional cooperation and orders.@@@The Islamic Republic of Iran advocates maximal economic and political convergence within and between regions and is interested in interacting with the global community under the principle of justice.@@@However, as independent nations increasingly align themselves towards cooperation and convergence, certain Powers are attempting to incite conflicts in various regions.@@@Employing a Cold War mentality, they strive to reconstitute blocs on a global scale.@@@That regressive endeavour poses a significant threat to the security and prosperity of nations.@@@The Islamic Republic of Iran staunchly maintains that the formation of new East-West divides should not be permitted to take shape.@@@Making trade corridors unsafe, diminishing the status of countries from allies to dependents, stifling the economic progress of sovereign nations, and fomenting proxy wars across Asia and Europe are all elements of that sinister chain.@@@Ironically, such actions are undertaken in the name of defending democracy.@@@However, the global community.@@@including nations of West Asia, have discerned the true essence of Western democracy — a designation that is all too often a code word for coups d’etat, occupations and ongoing wars.@@@The true nature of the liberal democracy project has become evident to the world and has been revealed to be nothing more than a velvet glove hiding a cast-iron hand.@@@A school that was once envisioned as a beacon for the world has been transformed into a cautionary tale illustrating the limitations and shortcomings of a system nearing the conclusion of its trajectory.@@@At the very moment when certain Powers are steering the world towards more wars, the Islamic Republic of Iran has put forward a policy of neighbourhood and integration.@@@The policy of neighbourhood is benevolent towards the region and is prioritized on the regional agenda.@@@The Islamic Republic extends a warm welcome to any hand that is extended in friendship, firmly believing that an independent and robust neighbourhood represents an opportunity for the entire region.@@@We will welcome any extended hand quite warmly.@@@A stable and powerful neighbour is healthy for a stable region.@@@Having endured two decades of imposed tensions and crisis within our region — the fruit of the resilience of free nations from Syria and Palestine to Yemen and Afghanistan — the future prospects of the region can be secured through the cultivation of profound mutual political trust, fostering extensive economic cooperation and establishing indigenous security measures.@@@In alignment with that vision.@@@Iran has established a new chapter of constructive relationships with likeminded neighbouring countries through membership in such regional and international mechanisms as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Northeastern Economic Corridor.@@@We have prioritized those developments in order to bring their benefits and their fruits to all peoples of the region.@@@The Islamic Republic of Iran also stands ready to work to mitigate the effects of climate change, to bring its national capacity to bear on renewable energy production, and to share those with other countries.@@@In the security sector, the good-neighbour policy seeks to increase regional cooperation and prevent external meddling from the Caucasus to the Persian Gulf.@@@Any type of foreign presence is not only not part of the solution, but is the problem itself.@@@We view the security of our neighbours as our own security and any type of insecurity for them is insecurity for us.@@@With benevolence and goodwill, we have taken initiatives throughout the region, although the convergence of politics and security still needs to be strengthened and can be realized only when it is accompanied by meaningful economic cooperation.@@@Due to continued military attacks and occupations, many opportunities for progress and development in the West Asian region have been set back.@@@Under the holy leadership of the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Revolution.@@@Imam Khamenei, we have been able to drive back the rotten foundations of terrorism and create new opportunities for the region.@@@The power of the Islamic Republic of Iran is an empowering security.@@@We seek to extend our hand to neighbouring countries in order to establish new horizons of hope and success for the entire region.@@@We believe that this must be a collaborative effort in the Muslim world.@@@It requires the participation of all and is the only pathway to blessings and success in West Asia.@@@The Islamic Republic of Iran has many and rare opportunities for investment that represent a great opportunity for countries throughout the world and the region.@@@Last year was the year of the victory of the people of Iran.@@@Over the past year, certain Western nations and their intelligence services made a grave mistake and miscalculation that sought to diminish, undervalue and underestimate the power of the Iranian people.@@@Ever since the Islamic Revolution’s victory under the leadership of Imam Khomeini, the enemies of Iran have sought, through various ongoing and never-ending plots, to impose their will on our people.@@@For more than 44 years, those policies have been defeated by the Iranian people and the Iranian people have stood victorious again and again.@@@Now our enemies are faced with an Islamic Republic whose power and progress are based on profound ties with its people.@@@Over the past year, the people of Iran have endured the powerful repercussions of a media and psychological war waged against them.@@@Can the United States of America, which now possesses the world’s largest prison for women—and therefore for mothers — sincerely call itself the defender of women’s rights?@@@The picture of Iran that it has sought to introduce to the world is a pastiche commingling legitimate and illegitimate news, lies and fake reports.@@@Realities from Iran are censored throughout the world in order to negate the truth.@@@Have we heard anything at all about the chemical bombardment of the Iranian people, using chemical weapons supplied by certain European countries to 
Saddam Hussein?@@@Have we been shown those whose bodies are severely and gravely damaged by chemical attacks and who are still alive but have been hospitalized for 35 years?@@@Have we seen their photos and images?@@@Have we been shown the sick children who cannot survive diseases of the immune system because of the sanctions imposed on us, preventing us from obtaining proper medication for their treatment.@@@Have we seen their photos?@@@Have we seen any pictures of the patience, sacrifice and steadfastness of the Islamic people of Iran?@@@Have we seen those pictures?@@@Has anyone seen the unprecedented movement of the remembrance of the martyrdom of Imam Hussein, the Prophet Mohammed’s grandson — 22 million-strong marching towards his burial site for the anniversary of his martyrdom?@@@The security of many countries throughout our region is owed to the sacrifices of our martyr General Haj Qasem Soleimani.@@@Had it not been for the sacrifice of that hero of anti-terrorism activities, many countries of the region would have burned to the ground in the fires set by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham (ISIS).@@@Who has heard the steadfast stories of his heroic fight against terrorism in the Hollywood-like reports generated by the news media?@@@Did anyone see the 25 million mourners of the late commander General Qasem Soleimani throughout Iran?@@@Those were censored throughout the Western world.@@@The terrorist act of his assassination was a prize given on a silver platter to Daesh, which, according to certain American officials, had confessed that ISIS was an American creation.@@@His martyrdom was a gift to that same ISIS.@@@Instead of being recognized for his sacrifices, he was assassinated.@@@Why?
The Islamic Republic of Iran, through the use of all tools and capacities in order to bring to justice the perpetrators and all those who had a hand in that Government-sanctioned act of terror, will not sit idle until that is done.@@@The blood of the oppressed will not be forgotten, and the guilty will be brought to justice.@@@The most serious threats in West Asia are extremism and fundamentalism.@@@The eradication of terrorism, through an all-encompassing fight against its very roots and the very causes that gave rise to it throughout the world, will not be easily achieved.@@@The surgical use of terrorists as a political tool by certain Western Governments will be overcome by the collective will of the people of the region.@@@Certain intelligence and security services of Western countries, by moving terrorists in a very targeted fashion from area to area in the region in order to capitalize on their devastating capacities, continue to be asked — including by our Head of State.@@@Prime Minister and congressional representatives — why they have given refuge again and again to officially recognized terror groups that have the blood of over 17.000 Iranian martyrs on their hands?@@@Why do the Europeans behave in this way?@@@They must give a reasonable answer.@@@Why do they claim to be fighting against terror even as they give refuge to terrorists?@@@This is a double standard.@@@Discrimination in the fight against terrorism is a green light given to terrorists themselves.@@@Iran, which has itself been a major target of terrorists, has been at the forefront of fighting terrorism in the region.@@@The people of the region see Iran as a secure partner for their own security, and the occupying regime in Jerusalem as the perpetrator of much of the violence in the region.@@@Has the time not come to bring an end to seven and a half decades of the occupation of the Palestinians’ lands, of the demolition of their homes, and of the shedding of the blood of their women and children, and for the people of Palestine to be recognized officially as a country?@@@The continuation of the occupation by the Zionist regime of certain Syrian.@@@Lebanese and Palestinian territories and the lack of recognition for the people of Palestine have been a negation of their inherent rights.@@@The failure to form a proper Palestinian Government, with its rightful capital in Jerusalem, has been a tool in the hands of certain Governments in the region.@@@Given the foundations that have been laid in the region by certain countries based on lies and destruction and occupation, those countries cannot be partners for peace.@@@The situation today in Afghanistan represents another example of foreign meddling in the region, which has led to the killing of over 70.000 men, women and children in that country.@@@Iran insists on an all- encompassing Government with the participation of all Afghan groups and population, but the assistance of the world is needed in order to address the crisis of refugees who have been driven from Afghanistan, a great many of whom are being given refuge in Islamic Iran today.@@@With respect to the Ukrainian crisis and the war.@@@I again recall our unambiguous position.@@@As the Islamic Republic, we do not tolerate or support any war anywhere — not in Europe or anywhere else.@@@We do not see how any war can benefit any side in Europe.@@@Any type of tension and fanning of the flames of violence in Ukraine is the work of the United States of America in order to weaken the European countries.@@@This is a longterm plan, unfortunately.@@@We support any initiative for a cessation of hostilities and the war and announce our full support for such initiatives.@@@In leaving the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the American Government officially trampled upon its commitments.@@@Breaking the agreement reached in the framework of Security Council resolution 2231 (2015) was an inappropriate response to our fulfilment of commitments within that framework.@@@The United States of America has committed egregious and unilateral crimes in the international arena.@@@It must explain itself transparently, demonstrate in a verifiable fashion that it wishes to reach a proper conclusion, prove its commitment and choose a path, be it the JCPOA or not.@@@By the same token, those European countries that ignore resolution 2231 (2015) and their commitments within the framework of the JCPOA will ultimately lose on that path.@@@Members of the General Assembly may rest assured that nuclear weapons have no place in the defensive and military doctrine of the Islamic Republic of Iran.@@@The appropriate international organizations and multiple official reports have stated as much.@@@Today just as two decades ago, the Islamic Republic of Iran will never stop short of obtaining the inherent right of the Iranian nation to peaceful nuclear energy.@@@We have lived up to our commitments, but unfortunately the United States not only does not adhere to its own commitments within any framework of international treaties such as the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, but it imposes sanctions as a political tool on nations such as the people of Iran.@@@However.@@@I reiterate today that those sanctions have not yielded the desired results.@@@It is time now for the United States to stop traveling the wrong path and to choose the right side.@@@Humankind is entering a new framework.@@@Old Powers will maintain their current downward trajectory.@@@They are the past and we are the future.@@@I repeat once again, they represent the past and we represent the future.@@@We are the future; our view of the future is one of hope.@@@The world awaits the day that has been promised by all Abrahamie faiths throughout the world.@@@The ultimate seeker of justice does exist.@@@We do believe that, in accordance with divine will and just as the divine prophets have promised, justice and fairness will overtake the world and the rule of those who sincerely follow the path of the Omnipotent will reverberate throughout the world.@@@The world rejects ignorance.@@@The world awaits the day in which the old paths will come to an end.@@@I bring warm greetings from the citizens of the Commonwealth of Dominica.@@@My delegation, and by extension the Government and the people of the Commonwealth of Dominica, wish to congratulate Mr. Dennis Francis on his elevation to the office of President of the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session and wish him every success during his term.@@@As Dominica currently holds the chairmanship of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM).@@@I also extend to him the support of CARICOM during his tenure.@@@His appointment is testament to the fact that the contribution of small island developing States (SIDS) to the multilateral system is of crucial importance, particularly with the innumerable challenges confronting such States globally.@@@Having served as Ambassador of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago for several years.@@@Mr. Francis’s experience and knowledge of many of the current issues impacting Member States should serve him well in leading the Assembly over the next year.@@@It is quite evident that the challenges being faced globally can be daunting.@@@The climate crisis seemingly will not go away, as evidenced, for example, by the recent wildfires in Hawaii and Canada, thereby illuminating the discussion on the need to give even more urgent attention to mitigation and climate financing.@@@Global inflation has had a significant impact on the livelihood of the most vulnerable, while there is justification for increasing concern over chronic non-communicable diseases adversely impacting the health and wellness of our people.@@@The conflict in Ukraine continues unabated, amidst the global call for an end to that terrible war.@@@Such a situation would normally be unthinkable in the twenty- first century.@@@As the conflict escalates, the World Bank’s most recent estimate for reconstruction and recovery of Ukraine is placed at $411 billion dollars.@@@That figure is expected to increase the longer the conflict persists.@@@All conflicts must eventually end at the negotiating table.@@@Dominica therefore calls for an end to the fighting and for good-faith negotiations to prevail.@@@We join all those resolute in their international obligation to uphold peace, as outlined in the Charter of the United Nations, and we support the call for a resolution to the issues giving rise to the conflict.@@@To that end.@@@Dominica endorses the joint declaration of the Group of 20 (G20) on the Russia-Ukraine conflict and other global issues, issued at the end of the eighteenth G20 Summit, held recently in New Delhi.@@@While we in Dominica are opposed to coups and attempted coups, we are also aware that in 2010 there was a series of uprisings affecting Arab countries of the Middle East and North Africa, which was dubbed in the West the “Arab Spring”.@@@Those uprisings, with at least the tacit support of the West, resulted in the removal of several Governments.@@@There was no talk of sanctions or military intervention to restore the ousted Governments.@@@Today we are witnessing what I refer to as the “African Summer” and we are hearing the drumbeat of sanctions and military intervention.@@@What is the difference between the Arab Spring and the African Summer.@@@I ask?@@@The international community should pay heed to the wisdom of the leaders of the African Union, who have opposed military intervention and urged diplomatic engagement.@@@The question is: Whose interest would military intervention serve?@@@It is certainly not that of the people of Africa.@@@We in Dominica and the Caribbean urge that, in all such situations, the interest of the population be foremost in any consideration of intervention by neighbouring countries and, indeed, by the international community.@@@This year’s theme for the general debate is in keeping with the strides we should all be making at the international and multilateral levels to achieve the accelerated and progressive implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@The challenges faced by small island developing States in achieving that objective are considerable.@@@Typically, the narrow fiscal space and the increase in economic and environmental losses attributable to changes in weather patterns and other climate-related events have served to increase our vulnerabilities exponentially.@@@The evidence suggests that we live in an imperfect world by virtue of our inherent geophysical and socioeconomic characteristics, and that some countries.@@@Dominica included, will always be disproportionately disadvantaged by the actions of others.@@@In that regard, we welcome the High-level Dialogue on Financing for Development and the call of the Secretary-General to convene the Climate Ambition Summit.@@@We are optimistic that this forum will be a practical demonstration of a commitment to securing the necessary funding to initiate transformative change.@@@The key elements for accelerating realization of the 2030 Agenda include the harnessing of information and communications technologies (ICTs) and the role that science will play in ensuring effective decision-making.@@@ICTs can provide a platform to get more done within a shorter period of time and further create an impetus to bridge the generational gap, allowing innovation and creativity to emerge to the fore.@@@Our youth must be continually engaged, thereby engendering a sense of trust in their leaders and institutions.@@@That is critical to ensuring that the significant gaps that currently exist between the haves and the have-nots are addressed and drastically reduced.@@@Access to quality education, clean water, food security, proper health care, decent work, proper housing and economic growth, taken altogether, must be the foundation upon which we continue to ensure that no one is left behind.@@@The immiserating of our more vulnerable societies by the unfair trade practices, must be replaced by trade practices that reasonably benefit primary producers and support and/or encourage downstream processing and manufacturing, while international resources must be targeted at the most vulnerable and indigent among us.@@@Only then can we be assured of achieving a society of prosperity, progress and sustainability for all.@@@Advancement towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) must be people-centred and complemented by policies that allow for security and peace.@@@The Government of Dominica recognizes the central role of its citizens in the decision-making process on major national issues and, to that end.@@@Government has engaged the expertise of the international community in reviewing its electoral system and has embarked on a wide cross-sectoral consultation to hear varying views from every segment of society on recommendations for electoral reform in the country.@@@It is therefore anticipated that when the final measures are brought before Parliament, they will be in keeping with the views of the majority.@@@The Commonwealth of Dominica will continue to identify with and champion the agenda of small island developing states at the international level.@@@Accordingly, we wish to emphasize the need for the implementation of the loss and damage fund agreed upon at the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.@@@The implementation of the fund will allow SIDS to access the required resources earmarked for the recovery of our vulnerable economies post-disaster and further facilitate the creation of a vital safety net for our people.@@@Over the past 30 years.@@@SIDS have been advocating for resilience-building measures based on our inherent vulnerabilities and the frequency and magnitude of increase in global shocks.@@@The lack of adequate assistance from development partners and international financial institutions has forced Governments to borrow at unfavourable terms, resulting in high repayment costs and unsustainable debt levels for our fragile economies.@@@To that end.@@@Dominica fully supports the work on the multidimensional vulnerability index, which can contribute to unlocking the type of financing that is so urgently required.@@@In addition.@@@Dominica pledges its full support and participation in the upcoming fourth International Conference on SIDS, to be held in Antigua and Barbuda in 2024.@@@The Conference should serve as a watershed moment for all SIDS, such that action-oriented outcomes can be derived.@@@Moreover, mindful of the confluence of challenges confronting SIDS today, there should be no further delay in the much-needed reform of international financial institutions to address the contemporary realities of debt distress and debt solvency.@@@Dominica therefore joins fellow States members of CARICOM in support of the Bridgetown Initiative as a core blueprint for restructuring the architecture of sovereign debt.@@@My delegation unreservedly welcomes the adoption of the agreement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction.@@@Building on the legacy of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, that achievement reaffirms the United Nations role in facilitating the implementation of multilaterally agreed solutions to global challenges.@@@Dominica supports the early entry into force of the agreement, as well as its implementation.@@@My delegation further welcomes the commitments, shared by all, to ensure capacity building and transfer of marine technology to support developing countries in their quest to implement and benefit from the said agreement.@@@The prevailing situation in our fellow CARICOM member State of Haiti is a dire one that deserves urgent international intervention.@@@Haiti faces deep-rooted 
crises on multiple fronts, many of them arising from its post-independence relations with the international community, poor governance over the years and the lingering effects of the catastrophic devastation visited on that country by a 7.0 magnitude earthquake in January of 2010.@@@To date, while there may have been preliminary figures.@@@I am not aware of any comprehensive assessment detailing the extent of the destruction of the 2010 earthquake or of a World Bank estimate of the cost of reconstruction, as has been done with the situation in Ukraine.@@@The fact remains that since 2010.@@@Haiti has been hit by several earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, pandemics and sociopolitical instability.@@@If ever there was a cause deserving the full attention of the international community, that cause is Haiti.@@@The Commonwealth of Dominica aligns itself with processes outlined by the Organization of American States in August 2022 to support the people of Haiti, and decisions taken by CARICOM, at its 45th regular meeting of the Conference of Heads of Government in July, to lend active support to the Government and the people of Haiti in their efforts to arrive at a Haitian-led solution to the ongoing crisis.@@@While both those institutions have offered commendable and necessary recommendations, even collectively those will not be sufficient to normalize the current situation in Haiti.@@@We have accepted that the crises in Haiti are not limited to food shortage and security.@@@The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification report lays bare the severity of Haiti’s food crisis, noting that nearly half of the population of 11 million is grappling with high levels of acute food insecurity.@@@Additionally, the humanitarian situation is being further aggravated by a national security problem, including the illicit flow of arms and ammunition and gang-related violence.@@@The Commonwealth of Dominica is of the view that a strategy that addresses the root causes of instability in Haiti will be embraced by the people of Haiti.@@@We also underscore that such an approach cannot be pursued without the unwavering support of the international community.@@@My delegation therefore calls on the Security Council to move decisively to offer support to Haiti in key priority areas, including security, governance, education, health, water and electricity, sustainable livelihoods and long-term development planning and advocacy.@@@Dominica continues to stand with the overwhelming majority of the international community in calling for the removal of the 60-year-old economic blockade imposed on the Republic of Cuba by the United States.@@@In November 2022, this organ voted overwhelmingly in favour of resolution 77/7— 185 to 2 — condemning the embargo; even Ukraine could not bring itself to support the United States in that outdated and unjust measure and abstained in the voting.@@@This organ must continue to condemn that egregious violation until it is lifted, as it has severely impacted the lives and livelihoods of ordinary Cuban citizen for the past six decades.@@@Additionally, the inclusion of that country on the United States State Department’s unilateral list of State sponsors of terrorism is entirely unjustified.@@@Furthermore, my delegation supports the lifting of sanctions imposed on the people of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.@@@That hegemonic situation constitutes a violation of the human rights of the Venezuelan people.@@@We therefore stand in solidarity with the Government and the people of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and look forward to a complete lifting of all such sanctions, thus allowing for the realization of the great potential for rapid socioeconomic development of that great nation.@@@Finally, as one of the more vulnerable small island States that were devastated in 2015 by Tropical Storm Erika, resulting in significant loss of life and the loss of over 90 per cent of our gross domestic product (GDP), and was again struck by Hurricane Maria in 2017, resulting in the loss of 226 per cent of our GDP, we empathize with the Government and the people of the Kingdom of Morocco, who were struck by a 6.8 magnitude earthquake on 8 September, resulting in over 3.000 deaths and twice as many injuries and the complete devastation of several communities.
Similarly.@@@Dominica empathizes with the Government and the people of Libya, who experienced flooding of biblical proportions, resulting in the loss of more than 20.000 lives, with thousands of citizens still unaccounted for, according to United Nations reports, and incalculable devastation in terms of infrastructure and built heritage.@@@We welcome the responses of neighbouring countries and the international community to the catastrophes in both of those North African countries and urge even greater response in line with the magnitude of these natural disasters.@@@I end by calling on all States Members of the United Nations to recommit themselves to the Organisation as an instrument of our joint obligation to the global community, and I wish all representatives to this seventy-eighth session every success during these deliberations.@@@The Security Council Chamber is decorated with a mural.@@@In it, the Norwegian artist Per Krohg depicts a phoenix.@@@The phoenix is rising from a world covered in ashes, a world rebuilding itself after war.@@@The lower section of the mural is dark, showing a dragon, soldiers and war machines.@@@The United Nations was founded to protect us from our demons, to elevate the global community towards peace, cooperation and solidarity.@@@And yet, the climate crisis is wreaking havoc.@@@The global effort to combat poverty is faltering and Russia’s war against Ukraine is aggravating food insecurity and generating an energy crisis.@@@Lastly, we are losing the sense of urgency that the pandemic instilled in us.@@@Progress towards gender equality is too slow, and, too often, is even regressing in many places.@@@The mantra of the Indian presidency of the Group of 20 (G20) is “One Earth.@@@One Family.@@@One Future’”@@@We are, after all, a global family, and the United Nations should form the backbone of this family.@@@But as Secretary-General Guterres says, today that family is a dysfunctional one.@@@The European Union aspires to a multipolar world that cooperates and moves towards greater democracy and more respect for human rights.@@@But trust is eroding, and tensions are multiplying.@@@A dangerous bipolar confrontation threatens us, as if everyone should have to take sides against each other.@@@A little like the frantic nuclear arms race last century, generative artificial intelligence, particularly in the military sphere, is becoming the arena for a new geopolitical competition.@@@The late Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold, however, wisely said: “The United Nations was not created in order to bring us to heaven, but in order to save us from hell”.@@@We need to acknowledge the situation.@@@Today the United Nations system is stuck in a rut and is being hindered by hostile forces.@@@Our responsibility is to commit to putting multilateral cooperation back on track.@@@To that end, we need to restore trust, resolve the most pressing problems and repair the machinery of the United Nations.@@@Trust is built on respect for the sacred principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations: sovereignty, territorial integrity and human rights.@@@Nevertheless, for the past 19 months, a permanent member of the Security Council.@@@Russia, has been brazenly waging a war of conquest against a neighbouring country that has never threatened it, shamelessly flouting our founding principles.@@@This brutal war is being waged with all its horror and disregard for human life.@@@The General Assembly has condemned the war on several occasions.@@@This is, of course, a powerful reminder of the principles of sovereignty and integrity to which we are so attached.@@@But that has not stopped the Kremlin in its murderous adventure or curbed its sense of impunity.@@@The European Union, together with others, has vowed that this impunity cannot last forever and that justice will be done.@@@The European Union will steadfastly support Ukraine in its right of self-defence.@@@We are well aware, and the European Union knows perfectly well, that this war against Ukraine does not make the many other major challenges facing the world disappear.@@@The planet is boiling.@@@The world is torn apart by poverty, injustice and discrimination.@@@A miracle will not happen if we do not decide to mobilise the massive amounts of necessary funding now.@@@For example, we have made a collective pledge to limit global warming to 1.5°C.@@@But if we stick to the commitments announced so far — and we are nowhere near doing so — global warming will reach 2.5°C by the end of the century.@@@We must wake up to that reality now.@@@With that in mind, the European Union has raised its targets for renewable energy use and energy efficiency.@@@We see that others are following us, as is the case, in part at least, with the G20.@@@We call for more members of the international community to commit to this.@@@It is also in everyone’s interest to help developing countries to commit to net zero emissions by 2050.@@@It is clear that only one quarter of global private investment is 
being made in developing countries, yet the 620 countries are responsible for 80 per cent of global emissions.@@@It is only this year that the international community is expected to reach the pledge it made several years ago of $100 billion to finance climate action.@@@The European Union is a driving force, providing $26 billion in 2021, which was more than its share.@@@The International Energy Agency estimates that global investment in the energy transition should reach $5 trillion per annum in 2030 — more than 4 per cent of global gross domestic product — to achieve zero carbon by 2050.@@@That is why, at the upcoming twenty-eighth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Dubai, we must establish the financing for the Loss and Damage Fund decided on last year in Sharm El-Sheikh.@@@As we see day after day, natural disasters are unfolding at a dizzying pace, causing suffering and desolation on every continent and in all our countries, most recently in Libya.@@@That is why we are calling for the creation of an international disaster fund, which is more necessary than ever to ensure rapid and fair assistance and strengthen our collective resilience.@@@Prevention is key.@@@We support the work being done within the United Nations on the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction.@@@Finally, trade is a powerful lever to bring together climate challenges and prosperity.@@@We are not giving in, and we call for an urgent solution for the World Trade Organization’s dispute settlement mechanism.@@@The economic and financial situation of vulnerable economies has been seriously affected by the coronavirus disease crisis and by Russia’s war against Ukraine.@@@More than 50 low-income countries have defaulted on their debts; a dozen others could follow suit in the near future.@@@Because of debt-servicing, which has supplanted expenditure on social protection, education and health.@@@165 million individuals worldwide have been tipped into poverty.@@@No one should be forced to choose between alleviating poverty and greening the economy.@@@We cannot afford the luxury of another debate about how much money to donate.@@@It is not a question of begging; it is a question of justice.@@@It is a question of making the global financial system more robust, fairer and better prepared for the challenges of this century.@@@The reallocation of $100 billion in special drawing rights is an important step.@@@We know that it is not enough; we need to do even more.@@@Of course, we support the Sustainable Development Goals Stimulus presented by Secretary-General Guterres.@@@The European Union is fully committed to implementing the G20 Common Framework for Debt Treatment.@@@We must go even further.@@@The Bretton Woods system requires fundamental reform.@@@It must be made fairer, more inclusive and more effective — that must be the aim.@@@Those institutions were created when many countries were still under colonial rule.@@@The world has changed a great deal since then, yet today the Group of Seven countries still wield almost absolute decision-making power.@@@The European Union is prepared to better share that decision-making power.@@@Regions that have virtually no say need to be more and better integrated and more and better involved.@@@Secondly, a financial shake-up is essential.@@@Whole swathes of the world and the populations represented therein are deprived of access to financing.@@@That not only hampers progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals, but it also increases the risk of a debt crisis.@@@Following on from the Bridgetown Initiative, the Paris Summit opened the debate on a New Global Financing Pact, launched by the French President and the Prime Minister of Barbados, and showed the way forward.@@@In the words of Mia Mottley, there is now a “need for pace and scope ...@@@Let us.., not only do the right thing, but do it in time, and do it for the right reasons”.@@@Indeed, we must do more to mobilize the private sector through public capital.@@@We need to act to increase, strengthen, tighten and consolidate the lending capacity of international financial institutions as an essential safety net.@@@To give one example, in the course of 60 years of existence, the World Bank’s financing power, as a proportion of global production, has fallen more than sevenfold.@@@That says it all.@@@We need also to reduce the cost of access to credit for vulnerable countries, which is far too high compared to the cost of access for so-called advanced countries.@@@We also need to adapt the rules of the multilateral development banks as regards capital adequacy.@@@That will allow them to utilize their balance sheets in a more dynamic way without jeopardizing their financial soundness.@@@Three years ago.@@@Mr. Tedros and I put forward the idea of an international treaty on pandemics.@@@Together, we embarked on a mission to convince the international community to launch negotiations within the framework of the World Health Organization.@@@The world needs an ambitious and legally binding instrument to prevent, prepare for and respond to any future pandemics in a spirit of solidarity.@@@I now appeal to us all to redouble our efforts to conclude the negotiations by May 2024.@@@The European Union is making determined efforts to that end.@@@We want to be a constructive and open partner.@@@The Secretary-General and all the United Nations teams are the workhorses of action on a massive scale for the benefit of humankind and the values of the United Nations Charter.@@@But as we have seen.@@@United Nations governance is all too often and increasingly hindered.@@@The European Union therefore supports the proposals for reform presented by the Secretary- General in his report Our Common Agenda (A/75/982).@@@We also emphasize the progress made on working methods.@@@However, it is our formal wish, from this rostrum to go one step further and try to provide a new perspective, a contribution to the necessary and urgent debate on United Nations reform.@@@We have three proposals concerning, respectively, the right to veto, representativeness and the role of multilateral regional organizations.@@@On those three points.@@@I call for an amendment to the United Nations Charter.@@@First, the right to veto in its current form is subject to abuse.@@@It renders the Security Council powerless.@@@A permanent member of the Security Council can flagrantly violate our Charter and international law with impunity.@@@A permanent member can abuse the right to veto to prevent sanctions against itself.@@@It can even exploit the Security Council for the purpose of propaganda, disinformation and, let it be said, lies.@@@And yet, the Charter provides that a member of the Security Council should abstain in the voting when it is the subject of the vote.@@@I urgently call on other members of the Security Council to invoke that clause where Russia is concerned.@@@In the same spirit, the European Union supports France and Mexico’s initiative to restrain the use of the veto in cases of mass atrocities.@@@We also support the code of conduct regarding Security Council action against genocide, crimes against humanity or war crimes.@@@We also support efforts to enhance the transparency and accountability of the Security Council.@@@However, apart from that, in the context of Charter reform.@@@I believe that we should set up a mechanism that combines majority decision-making with moderate, measured and flexible use of the right to veto.@@@My second point concerns representativeness.@@@The Security Council does not reflect today’s world.@@@There are 60 countries that have never yet held a seat on the Security Council.@@@Whole swathes of the world — Africa.@@@South America, the Caribbean.@@@Asia — have little or no representation.@@@We therefore support a global reform of the Security Council that strengthens the voices of those regions and countries.@@@Power and legitimacy go hand in hand.@@@The Security Council’s lack of representativeness is inevitably undermining its legitimacy, yet legitimacy is key and should be reinforced on two fronts.@@@The United Nations is a club of nations, and we consider the nation State to be its basic unit.@@@An increase in the number of permanent members of the Security Council is certainly inevitable.@@@But we believe that we have to go further than that.@@@The role played by regional and continental organizations is growing.@@@That is a fact.@@@The European Union, of course, the African Union, the Community of Latin-American and Caribbean States (CELAC), the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and others reflect a new level of legitimacy in international and multilateral forums.@@@They play an active part in political and economic coordination.@@@They create spaces for closer cooperation, spaces for connectivity.@@@Increasingly, they are even security actors.@@@More so than in the past, those organizations are spaces where rules are made.@@@That is the case of European integration.@@@But the European Union’s example serves as an inspiration to others, such as the African Union, which is working hard to create a large continental free-trade area, or ASEAN, which is aiming for increased cooperation among its member States.@@@Those organizations are exerting a growing influence on the multilateral stage.@@@They are vital contributors to stability, and I believe their role in the multilateral system must grow.@@@After all, they shape the structure of the multipolar world we are hoping for.@@@That is why, through me, the European Union immediately supported the call of Senegalese President Macky Sall to include the African Union as a full member of the G20, and that membership was granted a few weeks ago.@@@I am absolutely convinced that the United Nations would become more legitimate, effective and authoritative if it decided to guarantee regional organizations a more prominent role within the United Nations .@@@Including them would create a virtuous circle.@@@It would encourage regional organizations to cooperate more and better with each other, contributing to their own stability and to stability in the world.@@@In that context.@@@I intend to take the initiative to propose an institutional summit among the European Union, the African Union.@@@CELAC and ASEAN, to which of course the United 
Nations Secretary-General would be invited.@@@The aim will be to reflect on how those organizations can act together to strengthen the multilateral system, both in the framework of the United Nations and in the other international forums.@@@The European Union, through our history and through our DNA, wishes to be a global, fair and reliable partner.@@@The European Union and its member States are the world’s biggest donor for development and peacekeeping.@@@We are active, including in regions in which conflicts are protracted hopelessly.@@@In the Sahel, successive military coups are fuelling instability and insecurity, to the detriment of the local populations.@@@I take this opportunity to send a message of friendship and unfailing personal support to the President of the Niger.@@@Mohamed Bazoum, who has been imprisoned in a house by a military junta for 56 days now.@@@In the Middle East, we maintain that lasting peace will be achieved only when Palestinians and Israelis live in security in the context of a two-State solution.@@@We are shocked by the latest devastating developments in the South Caucasus.@@@Military force is not a sustainable solution when there are hearts and minds to be won.@@@Around the globe, the European Union will continue to assume its responsibilities, alongside anyone who sincerely wishes to work towards the common good, for peace and for prosperity.@@@But the European Union will never be intimidated by violence or blackmail.@@@The Per Krohg mural is a work of imagination, but it is also an appeal to our conscience and a reminder more crucial now than ever before in a world faced with so many dangers.@@@As the philosopher Friedrich Holderlin so rightly said.@@@“But where the danger lies, also grows the saving power”.@@@Faced with dangers, we have a vision of a better, brighter world.@@@We have powerful means.@@@I am a great believer in the power of collective intelligence.@@@It is up to us to act, now.@@@For a world that is fairer, freer and more prosperous.@@@On behalf of the Government of the Republic of San Marino, we would like to congratulate Mr. Dennis Francis on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session and to wish him success in his work.@@@I would also like to extend my special thanks to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for his energy and determination in leading the United Nations in these difficult and challenging times.@@@The coming years will be crucial not only for our future but for that of generations to come.@@@The promises of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development are in danger.@@@Despite years of sustainable development gains, millions of people have fallen into poverty, and hunger and malnutrition are becoming more prevalent.@@@We are concerned about the multiple interlinked crises that are pushing our world, especially developing countries, towards the brink.@@@The crises of climate change, biodiversity loss, pollution, migration, forced displacement, the cost-of-living crisis and the water, food, financial and energy crises are threatening our planet and people and derailing progress in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).@@@Moreover, the intensification of conflicts in many parts of the world, together with natural disasters, which have become more frequent and intense, are causing human suffering and compromising the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@The increasingly evident interrelationships among global challenges highlight the need for Member States to work together to overcome difficulties today more than ever.@@@No individual State, not even the most powerful or technologically advanced State, has the capacity to face global challenges on its own.@@@San Marino reaffirms its commitment to multilateralism, with the United Nations at its centre, in particular in the 
framework of the General Assembly, which is the most representative body of the United Nations on account of its deeply democratic nature, universal participation and undisputed legitimacy.@@@We need to strengthen our commitment to implement existing agreements, such as the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, the Convention on Biological Diversity and international law treaties, and make the necessary reforms to the system.@@@We need to revitalize the United Nations by reinvigorating multilateralism, if we want to pursue credible solutions to global challenges.@@@To that end, it is essential to rebuild trust in the potential of the Organization and its leadership — and most of all, trust among its Members and all its stakeholders.@@@Moreover, global governance must become more inclusive and accountable to be effective, by providing more space for the participation of civil society and the private sector.@@@It must ensure sustainable financing by catalysing a new generation of public and private investment in global goods, as well as strengthening the global financial safety net in order to make it possible for Member States to access international funding during times of crisis.@@@Reforms must remain at the centre of our action, because they are crucial to future world stability and the maintenance of international peace and security.@@@In that regard.@@@San Marino is following with particular interest the reform of the Security Council.@@@As we have stated on previous occasions, our country believes that the intergovernmental negotiations favour the search for an agreement based on a broad and strong political consensus that is able to reflect the interests of all negotiating groups.@@@San Marino calls for reform that makes the Council more democratic, transparent, efficient and accountable.@@@That goal can be achieved only through continuous dialogue among Member States and the awareness that overcoming their respective initial positions is essential to negotiate the broadest agreement possible.@@@We are facing difficult times, with an unprecedented level of violence, mass atrocities and displacement.@@@San Marino is deeply concern about the number and the scale of armed conflicts across the globe, which are causing immense suffering to millions of civilians.@@@San Marino is also very concerned about the alarming increase in dangerous nuclear rhetoric and nuclear threats, which reinforce the image of a dark future, instead of a sustainable one.@@@Any use or threat of use of nuclear weapons is irresponsible and totally unacceptable.@@@Unfortunately, the risk of nuclear weapons being used either deliberately or by accident is higher today than at any other time since the Cold War.@@@The use of nuclear weapons would cause mass-scale death and destruction and would have catastrophic and prolonged consequences for human health and wellbeing, as well as the environment.@@@San Marino reaffirms its commitment to achieving a world free of nuclear weapons and attaches great importance to the milestone Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, which more than 90 States have signed to date.@@@The war of aggression against Ukraine has resulted in dramatic consequences for the civilian population, including civilian deaths, the destruction of vital infrastructure and massive displacement.@@@San Marino condemns the Russian aggression against Ukraine and supports Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, within its internationally recognized borders.@@@At the same time.@@@San Marino welcomes all international efforts to bring about a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Ukraine, in line with the Charter of the United Nations, the relevant General Assembly resolutions and international law.@@@San Marino supports upholding obligations under humanitarian law, such as the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, the Rome Statute and the Geneva Conventions.@@@San Marino reaffirms its full commitment to the International Criminal Court, whose work is crucial to the fight against impunity for genocide and crimes against humanity and which represents one of the core elements for the implementation of the responsibility to protect.@@@Through its work, the International Court of Justice fosters accountability and thereby promotes prevention and reconciliation.@@@Armed conflicts around the globe have dramatically impacted the lives of millions of civilians and have resulted in continued and massive displacement.@@@San Marino is alarmed by the unprecedented food and nutrition crisis affecting hundreds of millions of people around the world.@@@The protection of civilian infrastructure is key to ensuring food security in times of conflict.@@@When infrastructure and tools essential to the survival of civilians are damaged or destroyed, food production and distribution, water delivery, sanitation, energy provision and health care can all be disrupted.@@@San Marino calls on all parties to implement Security Council resolution 2417 (2018), which condemns the use of starvation of civilians as a method of warfare.@@@as well as the unlawful denial of humanitarian access.@@@Furthermore.@@@San Marino supports Security Council resolution 2573 (2021), which condemns attacks against the critical civilian infrastructure that is indispensable for the population’s survival.@@@San Marino is particularly concerned about the high number of grave violations against children reported once again this year in the report of the Secretary- General (A/78/1).@@@Armed conflicts continue to devastate children’s lives and compromise their fundamental rights.@@@We are witnessing an increase in attacks on schools and hospitals.@@@That is unacceptable.@@@San Marino firmly condemns attacks on schools and hospitals, as well as their use for military purposes.@@@Health care and education are fundamental children’s rights that must always be preserved.@@@We reiterate our support for the Safe Schools Declaration.@@@Educational facilities should be a safe place for all children, students and teachers.@@@We are also concerned about the substantial increase in the recruitment and use of child soldiers.@@@We call on all Member States to ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict.@@@We also encourage all parties to support other important tools, such as the Paris Principles, the Paris Commitments and the Vancouver Principles on Peacekeeping and the Prevention of the Recruitment and Use of Child Soldiers.@@@San Marino supports the work of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict and her Office and welcomes the new action plans and commitments that have been signed or are in progress.@@@The increasing number of conflicts shows how diplomacy, mediation and conflict prevention are tools that must be strengthened in order to achieve sustainable peace.@@@Today more than ever, political solutions, inclusive peace processes, conflict-prevention strategy and strong faith in multilateralism are required.@@@Today we face several interrelated security challenges.@@@Access to natural resources is one of them, while climate change is increasingly both an existential threat and a key driver of conflict.@@@The link between the climate emergency and security issues is self-evident, and it needs to be addressed within the Security Council in order to respond to the needs of the poorest and most vulnerable communities.@@@The effects of climate change are causing suffering to the most vulnerable communities, especially small island developing States, least developed countries and those affected by conflict.@@@Rising sea levels, poor precipitation and record temperatures exacerbate the risk of instability by reducing harvests, displacing communities and destroying infrastructure.@@@Climate policies and green transitions offer opportunities for reducing the devastating effects of climate change.@@@It is imperative to address the challenges posed by climate change through ambitious mitigation and adaptation, in addition to the implementation of the loss-and-damage agenda and an adequate climate finance agenda.@@@If we fail, there will be devastating effects, not only for the planet but also for development and human rights.@@@Without the immediate acceleration of the implementation of the SDGs, our world will endure new periods of crisis and uncertainty.@@@The recent SDG Summit represented a chance to scale up the efforts to achieve the 2030 Agenda and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, including through development cooperation.@@@SDG investments, enhancing macroeconomic policy cooperation and implementing actions to accelerate sustainable development, in particular in support of developing countries.@@@San Marino commits to accelerating action to remove all legal, social and economic barriers to achieving gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls.@@@We also support the empowerment of other vulnerable groups, such as young people and persons with disabilities, aimed at the realization and full enjoyment of their human rights.@@@San Marino believes it is essential to continue to work for an inclusive and equitable quality education, including early childhood education and digital education, and we stress the importance of addressing the gender gap in education.@@@In that regard, we welcome the outcomes of the 2022 Transforming Education Summit.@@@San Marino calls on all Member States to spread the benefit of digitalization by expanding the participation of all countries, in particular developing countries, in the digital economy.@@@We also believe it is extremely important to accelerate the transition to sustainable food systems and promote healthy nutrition, diets and consumption practices, and to recover the momentum and accelerate the efforts to end hunger and all forms of malnutrition.@@@In that respect, we welcome the outcome of the 2023 
Food Systems Summit + 2 Stocktaking Moment, which served as the first global follow-up to the 2021 Food Systems Summit.@@@Moreover, as a promoter of resolution 74/209, which established the 29 September as the International Day of Awareness of Food Loss and Waste.@@@San Marino firmly believes that the fight against food loss and waste will contribute to promoting food security, and we welcome all the initiatives aiming at developing awareness of such responsible behaviours.@@@In conclusion, if we want to build inclusive, equitable and peaceful societies, it is essential to find new ways of working together and to ensure that multilateral institutions will be able to address the rapid changes taking place.@@@Member States must shoulder their responsibilities, including that of enabling our Organization to fulfil its mandate, which is to protect the citizens of the world.@@@Thanks to its century-old history of peace and freedom.@@@San Marino is a State with a strong vocation for dialogue and solidarity.@@@Our State is small, but we are proud to make our contribution to the work of the United Nations.@@@I wish to congratulate Mr. Dennis Francis on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session.@@@We are confident that under his stewardship, we will make progress on the important global agenda before us.@@@He can be assured of Zimbabwe’s support throughout his tenure.@@@I also pay special tribute to his predecessor.@@@Mr. Csaba Korosi, for leading the seventy-seventh session.@@@We value the role he played to promote science in our overarching goal to improve the lives and livelihoods of all.@@@It is imperative that we recommit to the Charter of the United Nations, multilateralism, solidarity, justice and the peaceful settlement of disputes for sustainable development and a shared future.@@@That calls on us all to respect the sovereign equality of nations, big or small, poor or rich.@@@By working together, we can harness our expertise and learn from one another to strengthen international institutions for the accelerated attainment of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@The impact of conflicts, terrorism, climate change-induced natural disasters, biodiversity loss and the rising prevalence of disease and pandemics, especially in the developing world, deserves our urgent attention.@@@Regrettably, progress towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) has been uneven, while global solidarity has been tested and self-interest supersedes cooperation.@@@We have a duty to reignite our commitment to the principles of the 2030 Agenda and rekindle the spirit of multilateralism.@@@To accelerate action on the SDGs, we must scale up investments in people and communities by ensuring access to quality education, health care, clean water and sanitation for all.@@@The creation of economic opportunities, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, especially among women and young people, must remain a priority.@@@Zimbabwe continues to entrench democracy, constitutionalism, good governance and the rule of law, following the recently held 2023 harmonized general elections.@@@I am pleased to highlight that our country enjoyed peace before, during and after our free, fair, transparent and credible elections.@@@Zimbabwe has been under illegal, unilateral economic sanctions for 23 years, imposed by some Western countries.@@@Those sanctions were designed to subjugate the sovereign will of the Zimbabwean people.@@@We therefore demand that unjustified unilateral sanctions, including those imposed on countries like Cuba, be unconditionally lifted.@@@We remain grateful for the support and solidarity of progressive countries in the comity of nations.@@@In spite of those debilitating sanctions, the people of Zimbabwe have become masters of their own destiny.@@@That is anchored in a philosophy that as a people, we have the duty and responsibility of developing our country, using our own domestic resources.@@@Partners and investors are welcome, but must be guided by our own vision and national priority areas.@@@We are recording unprecedented development and economic success milestones.@@@For the past three years, our country has been the fastest growing economy in our Southern African region.@@@Further.@@@Zimbabwe is prioritizing the eradication of poverty and improving the quality of life of our people, particularly those in rural areas.@@@The empowerment and capacitation of communal and small- scale farmers has seen us realize food and nutrition security at both the household and the national levels.@@@With effect from this year, our country will become a net exporter of wheat.@@@Zimbabwe has not been spared the negative impact of climate change.@@@My Government therefore continues to make the requisite investment in infrastructure to mitigate and build resilience towards climate change adaptation.@@@Dams are being built across the country.@@@In addition, we have begun an ambitious and yet achievable programme to sink solar-powered boreholes in each of our country’s 35.000 rural villages and schools.@@@Alongside each of those water points are commercial nutritional gardens for the empowerment of women and youth.@@@Through the use of our own resources, we have constructed an unprecedented number of schools and clinics and provided other social amenities throughout our communities.@@@Today’s realities across all regions bring to the fore the importance of global solidarity.@@@No nation, no matter how powerful, can stand alone to realize sustainable and inclusive development.@@@The high-level meetings on universal health coverage, tuberculosis and pandemic prevention, preparedness and response are welcome opportunities to reflect on the importance of maintaining essential services during pandemics and health emergencies.@@@The realization of affordable and quality health delivery, as outlined under SDG 3, is a key deliverable for my administration.@@@Science, technology and innovation are essential ingredients to leapfrog the modernization and industrialization of developing countries.@@@To that end.@@@Zimbabwe continues to reap the benefits of a comprehensive and transformative heritage-based higher education curriculum.@@@The innovation hubs and industrial parks established within institutions of higher education have refocused young people in our tertiary institutions towards developing and producing goods and services.@@@Allow me to reaffirm that Zimbabwe is now open for business.@@@Building resilience and tackling the adverse impact of climate change should be an urgent priority for us all.@@@In the case of Zimbabwe and the Southern African region, floods and droughts have affected the livelihoods of many, while hindering progress on national development.@@@May I express my deepest condolences and sympathies to the Governments and the peoples of the Kingdom of Morocco and the State of Libya on the recent loss of lives as a result of the devastating impact of climate change.@@@There is need for concrete climate action, as opposed to mere promises, so that we can strengthen our adaption, resilience and mitigation mechanisms.@@@We must transition to a low-carbon and resilient global economy by increasing investments in renewable energy, sustainable agriculture and green infrastructure.@@@Commitments made under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 
and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change must be honoured to deliver climate justice.@@@It is our hope that progress will be made to operationalize the Loss and Damage Fund.@@@Zimbabwe is implementing a climate change policy and response strategy while disaster management and early warning systems continue to be strengthened.@@@The need to reform global financial institutions is of the essence to unlock funding for developing countries.@@@The current exclusionary architecture, dominated by a few States, is failing to deliver the requisite resources for countries to finance their development priorities and other pressing health and environmental challenges.@@@The shortcomings in the last round of special drawing right allocations should be addressed.@@@Zimbabwe supports the stimulus package proposed by the Secretary-General.@@@We further call for long-term concessional loans, increased access to unused special drawing rights and the use of modalities such as debt cancellation and restructuring as stimuli for developing countries to grow their economies and build greater resilience.@@@We strongly condemn the tendencies of some powerful countries that preach peace, human rights and democracy and yet clandestinely fund conflicts and unconstitutional changes of Governments for their own narrow interests.@@@We further condemn the use of unilateral and illegal sanctions as a foreign policy tool at the disposal of some powerful nations, such as those sanctions imposed on Zimbabwe and countries like Cuba.@@@Such actions hamper the trust, global solidarity and multilateralism we desire.@@@It is important that we channel our collective efforts towards building peace and driving forward our development agenda for shared prosperity.@@@There is much more that unites us than divides us.@@@Similarly, the establishment of a fair and inclusive global security architecture has become urgent.@@@The maintenance of peace and security should never be the preserve of a privileged few.@@@Zimbabwe reaffirms calls by Africa for the reform of the Security Council, in line with the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration.@@@Allow me to conclude by reaffirming Zimbabwe’s commitment to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations as we implement our global Agenda 2030.@@@Collectively, let us restore human dignity, peace, security and stability, while safeguarding our planet for the shared prosperity of present and future generations.@@@Together, in unity and harmony, we are stronger.@@@At the outset.@@@I would like to extend my profound congratulations to Mr. Dennis Francis on 
his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session, and I wish him a very successful presidency.@@@Today the international community is facing multiple crises at a level we have never experienced before.@@@Following the negative impacts of the coronavirus disease pandemic, the major challenges facing developing countries range from an increase in extreme poverty, external debt and an unjust international financial architecture to the extreme natural calamities seen in many parts of the world, especially the recent natural disasters that occurred in Morocco and Libya.@@@I join other speakers in expressing our sympathy and condolences to the peoples of Morocco and Libya.@@@Those challenges have already been compounded by regional tensions and unilateral measures as a result of geopolitical rivalries, all of which have not only hampered the hard-earned development progress during the last decade but also threatened the survival of all humankind.@@@At this critical juncture, the most appropriate solutions are required in order to address such challenges.@@@There is a need for unified and collective actions guided by the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, and we must firmly uphold multilateralism in tackling those challenges.@@@To rescue our world from another catastrophe, our shared wisdom and united political determination are more critical than ever.@@@That must be done by putting aside any unilateral interests and resolutely avoiding greater confrontation and division among Member States.@@@To that end, the United Nations must be reformed in a way that enables it to effectively fulfil its mandate.@@@We need the United Nations to be more relevant and effective in our rapidly changing geopolitical landscape and to be able to address the challenges that threaten international peace, security and sustainable development.@@@We believe that we are now better equipped to tackle the global challenges, which include scientific and technological advancement and innovation.@@@Yet without our collective will, shared responsibilities and collective actions, the world’s most vulnerable peoples will continue to be left behind.@@@Resolving global conflicts and disputes by peaceful means is the only viable way to ensure long-lasting peace and coexistence.@@@In that regard, we urge an immediate end to the conflict in Ukraine through peaceful dialogue, without which we all will continue to be affected.@@@We also demand a peaceful resolution of the Middle East problem.@@@The Lao People’s Democratic Republic calls on all the parties concerned to resume dialogue and restore mutual trust in order to resolve the long-overdue Palestinian issue through the establishment of two sovereign States, coexisting peacefully, in line with the relevant United Nations resolutions.@@@Like many others, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic believes that unilateralism, particularly unilateral coercive measures, not only contravene the principles of the Charter and international law but also severely cause negative consequences for innocent people and hinder the national development of many developing countries.@@@In that regard, my delegation continues to join the global call for lifting the economic embargo against Cuba and removing it from the list of State sponsors of terrorism, in addition to calling for an end to all unilateral coercive measures.@@@As we approach the midpoint of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, many countries are still lagging behind.@@@We must therefore further strengthen and scale up our collective efforts, including by harnessing scientific and technological achievements to accelerate sustainable development and providing new impetus for innovation-driven growth.@@@At the summit of the Group of 77 and China held in Havana last week, the Heads of State and Government of developing countries echoed that science, technology and innovation, including information and communication technologies, have become fundamental for addressing global challenges and are one of the driving mechanisms of the transformation to accelerate progress towards achieving the 2030 Agenda.@@@In that context, a global governance system based on science, technology and innovation is essential to identify problems and find effective solutions for sustainable economic development, environmental conservation, poverty reduction and addressing inequality.@@@Similarly, in order to scale up the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the United Nations development system, development partners and international financial institutions must act together in a more coordinated manner.@@@The United Nations development system at all levels must also play an essential role in resource mobilization and coordination, including by supporting countries that are in special situations, in particular the least developed countries, the landlocked developing countries and the small island developing States, to address their specific challenges.@@@It is evident that one of the key obstacles to the implementation of the SDGs has always been insufficient financing.@@@Secretary-General Guterres said that “the global financial system is biased, morally bankrupt and skewed to benefit wealthy countries”.@@@That is a clear signal that the reform of the international financial architecture is an urgent and long-overdue task, which cannot be done without strengthening the participation of developing countries in international economic decision-making, norm-setting and global economic governance in order to adapt to the changing global economic landscape.@@@For the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, the SDGs are not just a global development goal but a national commitment.@@@In addition to the 17 global SDGs, my country is also working towards achieving SDG 18 — saving lives from unexploded ordnance.@@@Although progress has been made to different degrees on most of these indicators, unexploded ordnance remains a threat to our national development and poses an obstacle to other SDGs.@@@We therefore take this opportunity to call for the continued support and assistance of the international community to address that prolonged and challenging task.@@@With regard to the other SDGs, our integration of them into our national strategies signals our unwavering dedication.@@@Despite our great efforts, the progress made remains less than desirable, as the implementation of many SDGs has stagnated or regressed.@@@The Government of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic is now carrying out its third voluntary national review process, conducting track analysis on specific SDGs to identify which of them need more attention and support.@@@We will submit our voluntary national review at the 2024 High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development.@@@In addition, my Government has taken various measures, including the development of a financing strategy as part of our integrated national financing framework, with a view to building a more resilient national financing architecture and opening a window of opportunity to meet the financing needs.@@@As for our LDC graduation effort, we are embarking on the adoption of our national smooth transition strategy to help the Government, development partners and relevant stakeholders stay focused more on development priorities by addressing the most pressing needs and challenges that could disrupt the country’s graduation process.@@@The Lao People’s Democratic Republic has considerable natural capital, rich biodiversity and abundant water resources, as well as the opportunity for renewable energy development and investment in carbon capture and storage, which can provide the country with significant development potential.@@@In that context, we acknowledge the important role of science, technology and innovation in advancing the country’s national development agenda to promote green and inclusive growth, as well as a digital economy instead of a re source-driven economy, with a view to enhancing the sustainable use of natural resources.@@@In that connection, my country has adopted a national digital economy development vision and strategy.@@@Although the Lao People’s Democratic Republic is among the countries that contribute the least to global emissions, like others, we are a victim of climate change.@@@Nevertheless, we have strongly committed ourselves to the international climate obligations.@@@My Government has already adopted its national strategy for climate change, but ensuring its full and effective implementation will require sufficient financial resources and technical assistance.@@@That means access to climate finance and other funding resources, which would greatly support developing countries.@@@In that regard, my country urges the realization of the international commitment to mobilize $100 billion in climate finance for the countries in need of it most.@@@To that end, our delegation trusts that the outcome of the Climate Ambition Summit 2023 will lay a foundation for concrete actions in the lead up to the twenty-eighth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.@@@This year marks the fifty-sixth anniversary of the establishment of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).@@@As an intergovernmental organization for regional cooperation.@@@ASEAN has not only upheld regionalism and multilateralism but also played a central role in maintaining and promoting peace and security and development in the region.@@@We members of ASEAN are committed to further strengthening the ASEAN community, as well as to enhancing ASEAN unity and centrality in our engagement with external partners, including through ASEAN-led mechanisms, in order to promote an enabling environment for peace, stability and prosperity in the region and beyond.@@@In 2024, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic will assume the ASEAN chairmanship under the theme “Enhancing connectivity and resilience”.@@@The Lao People’s Democratic Republic will continue to build upon the past achievements of ASEAN in strengthening the ASEAN community and enhancing ASEAN external relations with our partners for a more connected and resilient ASEAN.@@@In conclusion, I would like to reiterate the Lao People’s Democratic Republic’s commitment to multilateralism, with the United Nations at its core, as well as our firm determination to advance the implementation of the three pillars of sustainable development — economic, social and environmental — so that no one is left behind.@@@Fifty years ago, almost to the day, two German States joined the United Nations: the then German Democratic Republic, as the 133rd Member, and the Federal Republic of Germany, as the 134th Member.@@@That step is of great importance to us Germans to this very day, for membership of the United Nations enabled my country — the instigator of terrible and horrific crimes — to return to the family of peace-loving nations.@@@We are profoundly grateful for that chance.@@@That return was not free of requirements.@@@The accession of the two German States was preceded by a visionary policy of detente.@@@The aim, as my predecessor — Federal Chancellor and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Willy Brandt — said here in New York 50 years ago, was to “fill in the rifts left behind by the cold war” (A/PV.2128./mra. 9).@@@Three things were essential for that.@@@The first was the clear commitment of both German States to resolve conflicts without force.@@@That was laid down in the Basic Treaty between Bonn and East Berlin, as well as in the treaties that the Federal Republic of Germany concluded with its eastern neighbours.@@@The second prerequisite was the renunciation of any form of revisionism by recognizing Germany’s new borders, drawn after the Second World War, as inviolable.@@@At the time, many people in West Germany were opposed to that.@@@In retrospect, however, it proved to be the right decision.@@@Finally, the third prerequisite was a foreign policy that did not ignore the realities of the Cold War and that, at the same time, always remained focused on overcoming the status quo — that is to say, the confrontation between the blocs and thus also the unnatural division of Germany.@@@When I look back here today at the beginnings of our membership of the United Nations.@@@I do so not only out of historical interest, but because the prohibition of the use of force remains the unfulfilled core pledge of our United Nations.@@@That is because the inviolability of borders and the sovereign equality of States also have to be defended in our multipolar world by us all, and because we today — especially today — need the courage, creative energy and will to fill in the rifts, which are deeper than ever.@@@Germany is strongly committed to those three ideals: the renunciation of the use of force as a political instrument, the rejection of any kind of revisionism and the determination to engage in cooperation beyond any dividing factors.@@@It is to those ideals that we Germans owe the great fortune of living in a unified country today, in peace with our neighbours, friends and partners around the world.@@@At the same time, what Willy Brandt stated here 50 years is all the more true today:
“In a world in which we are all increasingly dependent on each other, a policy for peace must not stop on our own doorstep” (ibid., para. 33).@@@German policy cannot and never will be limited to pursuing our interests with no consideration for others, because we know that our freedom, our democracy and our prosperity are deeply rooted in the well-being of Europe and the world.@@@That is why the order of the day is not less cooperation, sometimes packaged today as decoupling or as cooperation only among the like-minded.@@@Instead, we need more cooperation.@@@Existing alliances must be strengthened and partners sought, for that is the only way to reduce the risks of excessively one-sided dependencies.@@@That is all the more true in a world which, in contrast to 50 years ago, no longer has only two centres of power.@@@Rather, it has many.@@@Multipolarity is not a new order.@@@Anyone who assumes that smaller countries are the backyards of larger ones is mistaken.@@@Multipolarity is not a normative category but a description of today’s reality.@@@Anyone seeking order in a multipolar world has to start here at the United Nations.@@@That is why Germany supports the United Nations system and, as the second-largest contributor after the United States, pays its regular budget assessments with full conviction.@@@Only the United Nations — on the basis of the values enshrined in its Charter — can fully realize the aspirations of universal representation and sovereign equality for all.@@@That cannot be said of the Group of Seven, the Group of 20 (G-20) — as important as they are for achieving international consensus — the BRICS group of Brazil.@@@Russian Federation.@@@India.@@@China and South Africa, or of other groups.@@@I know that some will counter by asking: Is the United Nations not all too often unable to take action, paralysed by the antagonisms of its heterogeneous membership?@@@My response to them is that the obstruction of a few, no matter how influential they, should not lead us to forget that we, the overwhelming majority of States, agree on many things.@@@All of us — almost all of us — want force as a political instrument to remain banned.@@@All of us have an interest in ensuring that the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of our countries are respected.@@@And all of us should know what that requires — namely, that we also grant those rights to others.@@@Those golden rules are universal, even if many of us were not yet sitting around the table when the Charter of the United Nations was adopted in 1945.@@@Yet only 10 years later, in Bandung.@@@Indonesia, it was the African and Asian States liberated from colonialism that raised their voices to call for self-determination, territorial integrity, the sovereign equality of all States and a world without colonialism and imperialism.@@@That seems more relevant today than ever before.@@@It is by those principles that we, whether large or small, will all be judged.@@@Those principles must also form the basis when it comes to reshaping our multipolar world.@@@Only then can the global challenges of our time be mastered.@@@The greatest challenge of all is anthropogenic climate change.@@@Of course, the traditional industrialized countries have a very special responsibility in the fight against the climate crisis.@@@However, many other countries are among the biggest emitters today.@@@Instead of waiting for others, we all have to do more together to achieve the Paris climate goals.@@@Each and every one of us must have the opportunity to gain the same level of prosperity as people in Europe.@@@North America or countries such as Japan or Australia.@@@However, our planet will not survive if that economic development is attained with the technologies and production processes of the nineteenth or twentieth centuries — with combustion engines and coal-fired power plants.@@@That leads us to one conclusion — we have to decouple economic development from carbon dioxide emissions.@@@That is already happening in many countries, for we have the solutions and technologies.@@@As a key nation in the field of technology, we are offering to cooperate here for the common good.@@@If producers of renewable energies and their industrial users come together across continents, we will create new prosperity together in many places around the world.@@@I am pleased to announce today that Germany is honouring its pledges on international climate financing.@@@From €2 billion in 2014 and more than €4 billion in 2020, we tripled our contribution last year to €6 billion.@@@We have therefore kept our word, as will the industrialized countries as a whole, which will hit their target of €100 billion for international climate financing for the first time this year.@@@That is an important and overdue signal before we take stock in Dubai this December and negotiate new climate action plans for the period after 2030.@@@I believe that it is important that we be as concrete and as binding as possible.@@@That is why I advocate that we set clear targets in Dubai for the expansion of renewable energies and for greater energy efficiency.@@@We will be equally ambitious when it comes to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).@@@Climate action or development — that trade-off will not work.@@@Our Summit yesterday brought home to me how urgent it is that we make up for lost time when it comes to the SDGs, too.@@@We therefore want to use next year’s@@@Summit of the Future, which we are currently preparing with our friends from Namibia, to pick up the pace and push ahead with the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development It is important to me in that context that we ensure more private investment in Africa.@@@Asia.@@@Latin America and the Caribbean.
Let me offer just one example.@@@The entire world is currently talking about the diversification of supply chains and raw materials security.@@@Would it not be a start if at least the first production step were to take place on-site, where the raw material deposits are to be found?@@@Certainly.@@@Germany and German businesses are open to entering into partnerships of that very nature.@@@Of course, in the coming years we will all face the challenge of leading our economies, our energy supplies and our infrastructure to a resource-efficient, climate-neutral future.@@@That will require major investment.@@@To create the right conditions to bring about that investment, we have to address the debt crisis in many countries and modernize the international financial architecture.@@@I said at the start that Germany is not clinging to the status quo, including on this issue either.@@@We want something to change.@@@I have been calling — most recently at the G-20 Summit in Delhi — for the multilateral development banks to reform so that they can contribute more to financing the protection of global public goods such as the climate and biodiversity or the prevention of pandemics.@@@That is what the G-20 decided in Delhi.@@@Germany is also providing financial support for this reform.@@@We will be the first country to invest hybrid capital, to the tune of €305 million, in the World Bank.@@@It is estimated that this capital will enable the World Bank to provide more than €2 billion in additional loans.@@@Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has pointed to the rapidly increasing demand and humanitarian needs arising from the many crises worldwide.@@@Germany is the second-largest donor of humanitarian assistance around the globe and will continue to stand by the people who need it most.@@@The United Nations itself must not cling to the status quo, and by that I mean two things.@@@First, the United Nations must tackle the challenges of the future, just as Secretary-General Guterres has proposed.@@@One of the major issues, in my view, is how we can ensure that innovation and technological advances are used by humankind as a whole.@@@Artificial intelligence, for example, offers tremendous opportunities.@@@At the same time, it can cement the division of the world if only a few benefit from it, if algorithms only take part of reality into account, or if access is limited to richer countries.@@@That is why Germany is actively fostering exchange on the Global Digital Compact.@@@We should also talk about common rules for the possible use of generative artificial intelligence as a weapon.@@@Another question that will define our future is how the United Nations itself represents the reality of a multipolar world.@@@To date, it has not done so sufficiently.@@@That is most evident in the composition of the Security Council.@@@I am therefore delighted that a growing number of partners — including three permanent members — have stated that they want to see progress on reform.@@@However, one thing is clear.@@@Africa deserves greater representation, as do Asia and Latin America.@@@Under that premise, we can negotiate a text with various options.@@@No country should obstruct those open-ended negotiations with excessively high demands.@@@Germany will not do so either.@@@Ultimately, it is up to the General Assembly to decide on a reform of the Security Council.@@@Until then.@@@Germany would like to shoulder responsibility as a non-permanent member of the Security Council, and I ask members to support our candidacy for 2027-2028.@@@When I speak of peace these days before the Assembly, my thoughts are with those for whom peace is a distant dream.@@@My thoughts are with the Sudanese, who have become victims of a brutal power struggle between two warlords, and with the men and women in Eastern Congo and, as we speak, the people of Nagorno-Karabakh, where resumed military activities will lead only to a dead end and must come to a halt.@@@Of course, my thoughts are with the Ukrainians, who are fighting for their lives and their freedom, for independence and their country’s territorial integrity in order to safeguard those very principles to which we have all committed ourselves in the United Nations Charter.@@@But Russia’s war of aggression has caused immense suffering not only in Ukraine.@@@People around the world are suffering as a result of inflation, growing debts, the scarcity of fertilizer, hunger and increasing poverty.@@@Precisely because the war is having unbearable consequences around the world, it is right and proper that the world be involved in the quest for peace.@@@At the same time, we should beware of phoney solutions that represent peace in name only, for peace without freedom is called oppression.@@@Peace without justice is called dictatorship.@@@Moscow, too, must finally understand that, for let us not forget that Russia is responsible for this war, and it is Russia’s President who can end it at any time with one single order.@@@But if he is to do so, he has to understand that we, the States of the United Nations, are serious about our principles and that in the multipolar world of the twenty- first century, we do not see a place for revisionism and imperialism.@@@No one here in New York has expressed that as aptly as our colleague, the Ambassador of Kenya.@@@After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, he said this in the Security Council:
“Rather than form nations that looked ever backwards into history with a dangerous nostalgia, we chose to look forward to a greatness that none of our many nations and peoples had ever known.”@@@(S/PV.8970, />.@@@8)
Germany’s history holds many lessons about the dangers of such nostalgia.@@@That is why we chose a different path when we joined the United Nations 50 years ago — the path of peace and reconciliation, the path of recognizing existing borders, the path of cooperation with all in the pursuit of a better and more equitable world.@@@It started with a solemn promise that we made 50 years ago, a promise every one of us made upon joining the United Nations — to unite our strength to maintain international peace and security.@@@Let us all do our best to live up to that promise.@@@At the outset.@@@I congratulate His Excellency Mr. Dennis Francis on assuming the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session.@@@I wish him every success.@@@I also express my appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Csaba Korosi for his efforts in presiding over the General Assembly at its seventy-seventh session.@@@I commend the efforts of the Secretary-General.@@@His Excellency Mr. Antonio Guterres, and the staff of the United Nations for fulfilling its noble goals.@@@I would like first of all to offer my sincere condolences to my brother His Majesty King Mohammed VI and to the brotherly people of Morocco for the victims of the devastating earthquake.@@@I also extend my condolences to the Government and people of the sisterly State of Libya for the victims of the floods there.@@@We ask Almighty God for a speedy recovery for the injured and mercy for the deceased.@@@I affirm our full solidarity with them in that ordeal.@@@God has bestowed a favour on us by allowing us to live in an era of unprecedented accelerating progress, in which an innovative spirit prevails in the fields of medicine, technology and science in general, and wherein the human ability to use resources has multiplied, enabling the provision of a decent life for all of humanity.@@@The sequent innovations have brought about productivity, prosperity and a level of communication between humans in a way close to realizing the visions of science fiction.@@@Although this evolution has enabled us to realize many wishes, it has come at a cost for the people of the world, our planet and its resources.@@@The average life expectancy and standard of living for the majority of humanity have risen, and this has clearly manifested itself in population growth.@@@Nevertheless, poverty and unemployment rates have also increased, and there is a growing awareness of the lack of justice in wealth distribution, in addition to the dire consequences for the environment.@@@In areas such as genetics and artificial intelligence, the possibilities for realizing the well-being of all humanity are increasing.@@@But the gap between possibility and reality is also widening.@@@However, as those possibilities are unfolding in the same era, there are peoples who are grappling with child labour, starvation, unemployment and civil wars, while developed countries guard their borders against the influx of refugees fleeing this suffering, as if the peoples of the earth are living in two different eras.@@@Rapid technological development and the growing reliance on it open up unprecedented prospects for humanity to develop for the better.@@@Undoubtedly, science and technology are crucial for increasing productivity and improving the quality of human life.@@@But celebrating the means without responsible thinking about the ends for which they are used has led to major disasters such 
as the use of nuclear weapons, dangerous experiments on humans and genocide in concentration camps.@@@It is incumbent on us to keep pace with scientific and technological development, encourage it in our countries and encourage barriers between countries in this field to be removed.@@@At the same time, it is not plausible to ignore the worsening risks in terms of reality falsification, invasion of personal privacy, educational process disruption through the facilitation of plagiarism, and the spiralling effect of disinformation and ploys aimed at deception.@@@Therefore, in addition to the necessity of cooperation and investment in developing those technologies, we reiterate the call for unifying efforts to prevent the misuse of cyberspace and regulate this vital aspect, based on the provisions of international law.@@@In that context.@@@Web Summit 2024 will take place in Doha.@@@The convening of that event constitutes an important opportunity to review development in the field of technology and create new cooperation opportunities in the realm of technology for the benefit of all humankind.@@@It is also an occasion to welcome everyone to Doha.@@@We must not forget that there are peoples around the world, especially in our region, who are directly affected by the current tragedies and who consider their involvement in the issues I have mentioned as a sort of luxury.@@@If we are truly an international community and not merely diverse entities, it is our duty to strive towards ending the injustice afflicting them, at least in accordance with what is required by the resolutions of this body and by international law.@@@It is not acceptable for the Palestinian people to remain prisoners of the arbitrariness of the Israeli settler occupation and the rejection by successive Israeli Governments of any just political solution in line with the principles of international legitimacy.@@@We have to bear in mind that the failure of the international organization to take action against the occupation provided and continues to provide the opportunity for Israel to undermine the foundations of the two- State solution by means of settlement expansion until the occupation has taken the form of an apartheid regime in the broad daylight of the twenty-first century.@@@Even some of Israel’s close friends have taken notice of that.@@@Israel also responds to Arab peace and normalization initiatives with more intransigence and national ultra-orthodox extremism that are reflected in government coalitions, further settlement expansion, the Judaization of Jerusalem and attacks on holy sites, besides using heavy-handed means against those languishing under the occupation and tightening the noose on the Gaza Strip.@@@Qatar provides political, humanitarian and development support to the brotherly Palestinian people and contributes towards rebuilding the Gaza Strip, which is reeling under the siege, in addition to its continuous contribution to funding the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East.@@@It also continues its adherence to the principled stance regarding the fairness of the Palestinian question, which has become a credibility test for world politicians in relation to the Middle Eastern region.@@@In the case of Syria, it is not permissible to condone the gross injustice that has befallen the brotherly Syrian people as if it is destiny.@@@The crisis is still awaiting a comprehensive settlement through a political process leading to a political transition, in accordance with the Geneva communique and Security Council resolution 2254 (2015), in a way that meets the Syrian people’s aspirations while maintaining Syria’s integrity, sovereignty and independence.@@@It is regrettable to witness the outbreak of violence in the Sudan this year, which has had a dire impact on the brotherly Sudanese people and exacerbated the refugee crisis.@@@We condemn the crimes perpetrated against civilians in the capital.@@@Khartoum, and in the Darfur region, and we call for holding perpetrators to account.@@@We also call for the cessation of hostilities and recourse to the voice of reason, and that civilians be spared the consequences of the fighting.@@@We affirm our support for all regional and international efforts to facilitate reaching a ceasefire and hold a dialogue among Sudanese political forces about the future of the Sudan, with only one army charged with protecting, rather than ruling, the country.@@@In brotherly Lebanon, where danger hangs over the State’s institutions, we stress the need to find a sustainable solution to the political vacuum, while introducing mechanisms that thwart its recurrence, and form a Government capable of addressing the aspirations of the Lebanese people and getting them out of their economic and development crises.@@@The prolonged suffering of that brotherly people, caused by political and personal interests, is regrettable.@@@In Yemen, we call for the crisis to be resolved in accordance with the decisions of the National Dialogue Conference, the Gulf Cooperation Council Initiative and the relevant Security Council resolutions.@@@With regard to the Libyan issue, we reiterate our unwavering support for the efforts of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Head of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya and his efforts to achieve tangible results to resolve Libyan crisis.@@@It is clear that the solution in all sisterly countries that I mentioned lies in reaching consensus on the State’s entity and citizenship.@@@Regarding the situation in Afghanistan, we continue to coordinate international efforts and facilitate dialogue among the United Nations, the countries concerned and the caretaker Government of Afghanistan to ensure compliance with the Doha agreement in a way that ensures the non-recurrence of past mistakes in order to prevent Afghanistan from sliding into a humanitarian crisis that is difficult to manage.@@@It must also be ensured that Afghanistan does not become a haven for terrorist individuals and groups and that the Afghan people receive the international support and assistance that they need and enjoy human rights, including minority rights and women’s rights to education and work.@@@In the context of talking about our region, we reiterate our appreciation for the detente witnessed this year, as represented by the constructive dialogue and re-establishment of ties between the sisterly countries the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Islamic Republic of Iran, as well as between the Arab Republic of Egypt and the Republic of Türkiye.@@@The war in Europe drags on.@@@Along with Russia and Ukraine, it has consumed the entire Europe and has been affecting the whole world in vital areas such as energy and food.@@@In the absence of the prospect of a permanent political solution, and due to the ability to keep the war raging indefinitely by major international blocs engaging directly or indirectly in the war, a longterm truce has become the aspiration most sought by people in Europe and all over the world.@@@However, that cannot be the basis for long-term stability.@@@Based on the harm that has befallen the peoples of the two countries and the peoples of the world, and because such a status quo cannot be accepted, we reiterate our call on all parties to comply with the Charter of the United Nations and international law, respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States and resort to a radical peaceful solution that is based on those principles.@@@Our region is awash with tremendous potential and opportunities, and our peoples are tolerant and peace-loving, a fact that has been distorted by stereotypes and preconceptions.@@@During the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, there was an opportunity for interaction among peoples, and for the world to see our people as they are and to learn about some aspects of our culture and values, besides Qatar’s stature as a global destination and nexus between East and West.@@@We emphasized the role that sport plays in building bridges of communication and rapprochement among peoples and cultures.@@@I hope that we have contributed, through that tournament, to breaking the stereotypes and have presented a new exciting and safe tournaments’ formula to the world.@@@In Qatar, we have had a dream that our country will be one of the prosperous nations whose people enjoy well-being and prosperity, and we have invested decades of planning and comprehensive development work to make that dream come true.@@@We have achieved a great deal, thanks to God and the solidarity of everyone in Qatar.@@@While investing in liquefied gas was a leverage to realize that dream, our investment has enabled us to play an important role in addressing the energy challenge around the world with a realistic vision that takes into account the world needs for a diverse mix of different energy sources by using the highest levels of advanced technology that is, at the same time, environmentally friendly.@@@We realize that energy export imposes obligations on us, as a reliable partner, towards the countries of the world, while, at the same time, imposing obligations on us towards our people and the future generations as well.@@@Hence Qatar continues to develop its sovereign fund and diversify the sources of its income, including investment in clean energy.@@@The State of Qatar pursues environmentally friendly policies and supports various projects for protecting them.@@@In that context, we are going to host the Qatar Horticultural Expo next month.@@@State responsibility also prompts Qatar to strengthen its role in providing humanitarian aid, exerting mediation efforts and resolving conflicts that affect our region.@@@The road to resolve conflicts through 
peaceful means is a long and strenuous path, but it is less costly than wars.@@@Our commitment to continuing our efforts in facilitating and making peace is a principled commitment deeply rooted in the core of our foreign policy.@@@We reaffirm that we are proud of our partnership with the international Organization, and there is no clearer evidence of that than the opening of the United Nations House, which so far includes 12 United Nations offices, in the presence of the Secretary- General of the United Nations in Doha last March.@@@In March, my country also hosted the fifth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, which is considered one of the most prominent international forums.@@@It galvanized efforts to achieve the ambitious goals of the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the Decade 2022-2031.@@@While we affirm that the State of Qatar is a major and active partner in the efforts to respond to the priorities and needs of those countries, we welcome the Sustainable Development Goals Summit held yesterday.@@@We are pleased that the State of Qatar is once again playing a leading role in major debates under the umbrella of the United Nations, the most recent of which is working with Ireland to facilitate governmental negotiations on the political declaration adopted by the Sustainable Development Goals Summit yesterday.@@@We believe that cooperation in those areas contributes to preventing the waves of refugees that have become a real problem for Europe as well as for African and Asian countries.@@@Allow me to pinpoint the need to combat racism and campaigns of incitement against entire peoples, religions and civilizations.@@@On this occasion.@@@I would say to my Muslim brethren that it is implausible for us to get distracted by an idiot or a biased person whenever it occurs to them to provoke us by burning the Holy Qur’an or by other trivial means.@@@The Qur’an is too holy to be desecrated by a witless person.@@@God Almighty said: “Embrace forgiveness, enjoin what is right and turn away from the ignorant” (The Holy Qur’an, VII: 199).@@@At the same time.@@@I would say to all those who seek to justify those hideous acts as freedom of expression that compromising the sanctity of others deliberately should not be seen as an example of the freedom of expression.@@@In conclusion, it is the duty of leaders to empower their peoples with the means to live in peace and security and to look forward to a better future for upcoming generations.@@@There are obstacles at the level of the international community, primarily seen in the failure to subject contradictions and competition among major countries on cross-cutting issues to the minimum binding principles owing to variations in governance systems.@@@Such issues, which concern all humankind, include climate change, environmental matters in general, poverty and the blatant injustice represented by occupation, racism and war crimes.@@@That is the consensus that must take place here in this international Organization in order for it not to become bogged down in details and to safeguard the future of entire peoples from loss owing to the unwillingness of such countries to cooperate in implementing international law.@@@May peace, mercy and blessings of God be upon members.@@@I bring the General Assembly warm greetings and a goodwill message of peace, progress and stability from President Adama Barrow and the Government and the people of the Gambia — Africa’s smiling coast.@@@We congratulate the President on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session and thank his predecessor.@@@Mr. Csaba Korosi, for his sterling leadership during the seventy-seventh session.@@@We also express our gratitude to the Secretary- General of our Organization.@@@Mr. Antonio Guterres, for his hands-on leadership during these heady and turbulent times being felt throughout the world.@@@The world is facing numerous crises and a multitude of daunting challenges that raise serious questions about the readiness and viability of our multilateral institutions and arrangements in the event of another crisis or pandemic.@@@The priorities of our times urgently warrant our collective attention and action.@@@We must therefore undertake major reforms and organize our institutions better to make them fit for purpose.@@@Achieving that has to begin with renewing our faith in both the Charter of the United Nations and inclusive multilateralism.@@@For those reasons, we believe that the theme for the current session.@@@“Rebuilding trust and reigniting global solidarity: accelerating action on the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals towards peace, prosperity, progress and sustainability for all”, mirrors the Gambia’s national ethos of peace, progress and prosperity.@@@Our world direly needs to rebuild that lost trust, and we must work within our multilateral institutions to help to regain it, first and foremost by reforming and retooling ourselves.@@@From underdevelopment to climate change, from unsustainable debts to cost-of-living crises, from conflicts to marginalization — we need to cooperate better and share the burden of solutions equitably through greater partnerships and solidarity.@@@We have seven more years before the Decade of Action ends, yet the story of our global attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is not very positive.@@@It is a story of unfulfilled commitments, weak international cooperation and a lack of genuine global solidarity.@@@It is a story that is all too common when it comes to implementing global commitments.@@@Consequently, we must recognize those global challenges and redouble our efforts by recommitting ourselves to the attainment of the SDGs in the global South.@@@If we remain on our current trajectory without effecting corrective action, the world’s most vulnerable peoples will be left behind much further than we can even fathom.@@@As a least developed country (EDC), we call for the steadfast implementation of the new Doha Programme of Action to ensure that it does not become another lost decade of unfulfilled commitments.@@@In view of the current harsh economic realities across the global South, many developing countries are contending with unsustainable debt burdens that are compromising their ability to dig themselves out of poverty.@@@In the quest for post-pandemic recovery, debt servicing is severely shrinking our economies, especially in the least developed countries.@@@It is essential to find ways to address that burden urgently, as most of our countries run the risk of being left behind.@@@Our goal is to recover by building back our economies much better and faster and to create the policy space that would generate growth once again.@@@The international community should with a deep sense urgency step up its efforts through new and existing initiatives towards finding durable solutions to the debt problem.@@@In sum, we must get back on track to attaining the SDGs.@@@The issue of debt relief for LDCs is linked to the necessity for greater reform of the international financial institutions and their decision-making mechanisms, particularly those relating to development finance and debt.@@@We join other developing countries in calling for reforms that would ensure our greater participation and a stronger voice in decision-making.@@@We would also like to see mechanisms developed that adequately mainstream our concerns and interests in decisions that affect us.@@@In that context, we strongly welcome the recent designation of a permanent seat for the African Union in the Group of 20.@@@That will immensely amplify Africa’s voice and participation in the discussion of global geopolitical and development issues that concern the well-being of its people.@@@One of the important global issues negatively affecting Africa in disproportionate ways is climate change.@@@Africa is paying a very heavy price for global warming, even though it contributes the least to climate change.@@@The cataclysmic weather events currently affecting our world clearly make it imperative and urgent to undertake collective action to tackle climate change for a more liveable world.@@@The world lacks neither the climate action commitments nor the financial resources to match our ambitions, but we are short of the genuine political will to act decisively.@@@When will we meet the $100 billion annual commitment to combat this phenomenon?@@@Will we ever agree on the modalities for the loss-and-damage fund at the twenty-eighth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change?@@@Those are important questions to ask, considering the prevailing mistrust that continues to characterize the global dialogue on climate change and climate action.@@@We have to act without delay and rebuild trust in our collective fight against global warming.@@@In the Gambia, through our nationally determined contribution under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, we are acting through various initiatives and projects to combat climate change.@@@We call on Member States and the international community to fulfil their commitments to Mother Earth with a greater sense of urgency.@@@On behalf of the people of the Gambia.@@@I extend our heartfelt condolences and deepest sympathies to the States of Türkiye and Morocco in the wake of the recent earthquakes that struck their nations.@@@Our thoughts are with the affected communities as they recover from those tragic events.@@@In addition, we sympathize with all countries that have recently endured the devastating consequences of deadly floods, wildfires and other natural disasters exacerbated by the effects of climate change.@@@Those events serve as a stark reminder of the urgent need for collective action to address the challenges posed by our changing climate.@@@The Gambia reaffirms its commitment to working together with the international community to mitigate and adapt to climate change.@@@Our world also faces several challenges relating to the maintenance of international peace and security.@@@In Africa, we continue to face the threats of terrorism, piracy and the re-emergence of unconstitutional changes of Government, civil strife and armed conflicts across the Sahel and the Horn of Africa.@@@The scenario is similar across parts of the Middle East.@@@The ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict is another matter of serious geopolitical concern in view of its wider global impact.@@@The institutional failures, human suffering and huge number of lives lost should serve as a wake-up call for all Member States.@@@To say that the institutions, mechanisms and processes we created in the aftermath of Second World War are inadequate in terms of preventing the scourge of war would be an understatement.@@@There is therefore a pressing need to revisit our responses to conflicts and devise new and effective arrangements for conflict resolution and conflict management.@@@Today we are hamstrung by the weaknesses of our institutions and arrangements, a situation that is greatly exacerbated by mistrust and a lack of genuine international solidarity.@@@In the face of the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, we call on the 
warring parties to give peace a chance.@@@We further call on them to respect the sanctity of human life.@@@It is only through negotiation and political dialogue that such conflicts can end.@@@We also call on our brothers and sisters in the Sahel and the Horn of Africa to choose peace over armed conflict.@@@Since our political transition in 2017.@@@The Gambia has committed itself to the consolidation of democracy, human rights and the rule of law.@@@Good governance, accountability and institutional reforms are progressively taking root in our society.@@@Sustaining and building the peace that we have so heavily invested in will remain a priority for the Government.@@@We have also instituted transitional justice mechanisms that have yielded substantial results, and we are fully committed to implementing the recommendations of the Truth.@@@Reconciliation and Reparations Commission set up in 2018.@@@West Africa is facing serious challenges in connection with development, democratic governance, the rule of law, peace and security.@@@As we grapple with those regional challenges, let me assure the Assembly that, in The Gambia, we are truly committed to nurturing our young democracy, institution-building, protecting and promoting fundamental rights and freedoms, as well as women and youth empowerment.@@@We are now enjoying the dividends of democracy, and we believe it is the best form of governance for our people.@@@Furthermore, in our quest to inclusively deliver the dividends of democracy and build a more secure and prosperous Gambia, the Government recently developed a new Green Recovery-Focused National Development Plan 2023-2027 as a successor to the 2018-2021 National Development Plan.@@@While it appreciates the support and partnership received during the implementation of the National Development Plan.@@@The Gambia solicits the continuous support and partnership of all its friends, partners and the international community to successfully implement its new development master plan.@@@The pursuit of peace around the world is one of the central pillars of the United Nations work.@@@The adaptability of the Organization to resolve ongoing, new or emerging peace and security challenges is worthy of sober reflection.@@@Peacekeeping missions in situations in which terrorism, violent extremism or gang violence is endemic demand serious dialogue within the Organization.@@@No society should be held hostage because our institutional arrangements are ineffectively suited for action in such situations.@@@Traditional peacekeeping has worked in a lot of situations, but it has come under enormous pressure in recent times.@@@Such difficult experiences, as exemplified in some peacekeeping missions in Africa, flag the need for wisdom for reform.@@@As a demonstration of our commitment to peacekeeping undertakings, in support of the Secretary- General’s Action for Peacekeeping, we have agreed with Bangladesh, with the support of the Secretariat, to jointly deploy a battalion in a suitable peacekeeping mission.@@@That is an innovative arrangement where our two countries will collaborate to advance peace.@@@Allow me to share some thoughts on topical international political developments and situations that require our attention.@@@The maltreatment of migrants across the world is a matter of serious concern to my delegation.@@@Migrants are human beings with human rights, and they deserve to be treated humanely.@@@We are appalled by the cruel and degrading treatment meted out to migrants at certain borders in Africa and beyond.@@@We call on the United Nations to investigate those incidents and crimes committed against migrants, with a view to protecting them and their families.@@@Criminalizing migration or treating migrants as criminals is unacceptable.@@@Let us open legal pathways for migration and the regularization of the status of migrants in line with our international commitments, including those under the Global Compact for Safe.@@@Orderly and Regular Migration.@@@The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been going on for too long.@@@The conflict requires a lasting solution.@@@Settlement activities need to stop.@@@We express serious concern over the ongoing loss of life and injuries suffered by Palestinians in the region.@@@Allow me to commend the Kingdom of Morocco once again for the efforts it continues to undertake towards the resolution of the dispute in the Moroccan Sahara.@@@The Gambia reaffirms its strong support for the Moroccan autonomy initiative, which it believes serves as a serious, credible, realistic compromise solution that could resolve the dispute as affirmed in relevant United Nations resolutions.@@@Our bilateral relationship with the Peoples Republic of China is founded on the principles of peaceful coexistence, mutual respect and a commitment to 
mutually beneficial development.@@@We therefore strongly endorse the one-China policy.@@@Allow me to highlight that reform of the United Nations, especially that of the Security Council, is long overdue.@@@Africa’s marginalization and underrepresentation in the membership of the Council calls for corrective measures.@@@After more than 75 years of existence, that body deserves urgent reforms to regain the world’s trust.@@@In furtherance of that call, my delegation strongly supports the common African position on that important issue.@@@In conclusion, rebuilding trust across the wide spectrum of issues that I have raised is a matter of utmost priority.@@@The urgency of rebuilding trust in our multilateral institutions across the globe is glaringly evident.@@@To avoid exclusion of the most vulnerable members in this decade of action.@@@The Gambia calls for greater international cooperation and renewed solidarity.@@@We can all make a huge difference if we commit to rekindling global solidarity during these critical times.@@@Concerted global action, sustained international solidarity and increased partnerships are the antidote for our current global challenges.@@@I should like at the outset to congratulate my dear brother from Trinidad and Tobago on his assumption of the office of the presidency of the General Assembly.@@@I would also like to thank the Secretary-General for his continued determination and for holding us and the rest of the world to the principles that are sacred to this institution.@@@The truth is that the speech that he delivered at the beginning of this session of the General Assembly (see A/78/PV.4) can be adopted wholesale by the Government and people of Barbados because it reflects our aspirations, and it reflects our view of the current status of the world.@@@I asked myself on Monday night, as we met to determine the halfway point of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): How many roads do we have to walk just to make it to the door, only to be told that the door is closed?@@@Those are not my words.@@@They are the words of Rocky Dawuni, a famous reggae artiste from Ghana, nominated for awards multiple times.@@@But his words ring true because, in a very real sense, are we going to tread the roads, only to be told that it is too late?@@@Too late for us to save as many as we can from the climate crisis?@@@Too late for us to save as many as we can from the conflicts of war?@@@Too late for us to be able to provide the food that so many need as we reflect on the fact that more people are likely to be hungry in this world in 2030 than in 2015?@@@Or as we get to the basic numbers that 735 million people suffered chronic hunger last year at a time when so many others had so much to throw away and to use?@@@Are we going to be too late for the SDGs that are really the promise of development and the promise of the conferral of dignity on our people?@@@We have today to determine what is the will of this organ, comprised of the Member States, to make the fundamental governance changes that will deliver in the third decade of the twenty-first century.@@@Our world, as everyone knows, is replete with issues and I do not need to stand here and recount them in detail, for we have heard them in almost every speech delivered from this rostrum.@@@But what is the issue is whether we can summon the determination that is required of us to make the changes that are appropriate to the age in which we live.@@@Our democracy cannot survive if we do not have the same facts, but yet we live in a world where the generation of fake news is almost a daily occurrence and where people act on those premises without consideration for whether the news is true or not.@@@The role that artificial intelligence (Al) and generative artificial intelligence will play in our world must be for good purposes and not evil, but if we are to ensure that is the case, then an appropriate framework for regulatory action must be put in place.@@@We therefore support the actions of the Secretary- General, recognizing that the question will come one day from some, as to whether we sought to preserve our democracy or whether we allowed it to crumble and whether we have failed ourselves as individual citizens of the world.@@@We ask that question recognizing that Al is not in the immediate focal point of many because the drama and the crises that surround climate are taking up all of the oxygen, literally, in the world.@@@Those people who died in Libya recently were going about their business.@@@They had aspirations.@@@They had business that they were hoping to do, families that they were trying to protect.@@@And in the flash of an eye, all of that came to an end, and not because we did not expect it or anticipate it.@@@The records of the multinational companies that are engaged in fossil fuels will show that they have known for a considerable period of time the consequences of their actions.@@@And while they themselves are not the immediate cause, the absence of technology to be able to limit what they are emitting is the cause.@@@And by extension, therefore, they must take responsibility.@@@We can go no further without an engagement of the oil and gas companies that is meaningful and credible, and we need to stop talking about it and just simply ensure that that kind of conversation can happen.@@@But it is not just the oil and gas companies.@@@We have nothing against them.@@@We do not want to bankrupt them, but their actions continue to have implications for too many of our people.@@@Their actions are equally bolstered by what I call the “FIT group”: the financial institutions, the insurance companies and the transport companies.@@@They get a bye or a pass because they are invisible to the transactions and the activity that lead to the problems that the world is facing.@@@But they too are as responsible and need to step up to the plate.@@@The notion that we can preserve global public goods only with public money ignores the fact that we have seen for the past 50 years the absolute dominance of the capitalist markets lead into a consolidation of wealth.@@@For that reason, their ability to be able to play that role must be examined by the rest of us.@@@We cannot continue to put the interests of a few before the lives of many.@@@I ask us today truly to pause because what keeps ringing in my head is that simple phrase: “Do not fail us now.@@@Do not fail us now.”@@@And that phrase can come from that little boy or girl who is a victim of hunger, one of the 575 million people last year.@@@That plea can equally come from those who lost families in the multiple crises across the world in the past few years.@@@That plea can come from small States that may not exist in the future.@@@I therefore ask my friends to ensure that we summon the will.@@@We listened to the Prime Minister of the Netherlands just now, and he reminded us ably that time is not on our side.@@@And if time is not on our side, what must we do?@@@The truth is, we have made some progress.@@@Two years ago, the International Monetary Fund did not have a mechanism to focus on the cause of the problems that led to massive macroeconomic instability.@@@We now have the establishment of the Resilience and Sustainability Trust, which, for the first time, will 
make funds available to middle-income countries that are vulnerable — 20-year money with a 10 and a half-year moratorium.@@@A year ago, the President of the World Bank was questioning whether there was a climate crisis.@@@Today we have a World Bank that, for the first time, acknowledges that there should be clauses to suspend debt — “debt pause clauses”, as they call them.@@@Our battle now is to ensure that those provisions that pause clauses are not just for future instruments, but for existing instruments.@@@If not, they will not help many.@@@We have made progress, but there is still much to be done.@@@The issues of debt sustainability cannot be left on the sidelines, particularly with the number of countries — more than 60 — facing debt row today, as we speak, because of the polycrises and because countries are being forced to choose between development and the building of resilience to fight climate.@@@In our small island States, we value education, health care and the dignity of life, and therefore it will be anathema for us to tell our citizens that we do not have the space to provide for them those things that were the promise of independence.@@@That is compounded by the failure of the developed world to accept that reparatory justice is a solemn obligation that we must confront.@@@The conversation King Charles III held at the opening of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, when he was Prince Charles, was a conversation whose time had come — that of reparatory justice.@@@But it cannot be a slow conversation, taken up when people feel like it has to be a conversation in which equal partners discuss.@@@It cannot be an act of charity of those who simply feel that their conscience must be cleansed.@@@We were about to write to the leaders of the European Union last year on the issue of reparatory justice.@@@We paused because of the Russian incursion into Ukraine, but it seems as though there are those who do not want to make peace, there or elsewhere in the world.@@@And therefore we have to lift our finger off the pause button and resume the discussions because the development deficit caused by centuries of exploitation is now affecting our capacity to build the resilience that is necessary in our nations.@@@Similarly.@@@I want to express my thanks, because a year ago we did not have the Paris Agenda for People and the Planet.@@@We had the Bridgetown Initiative, and the Bridgetown Initiative has allowed us to keep the debate going because we need to change — as I said Monday morning in this Hall — the belief that we can have short-term money financing development and building resilience.@@@I shall not go into all of the details because we do not have the time, but suffice it to say that we are committed to the twin battle of saving people and planet, and to ask us to do anything else is a false construct that does not work.@@@The markets have to be educated as to why long-term capital is the only salvation for developing countries and, ultimately, for people and the planet.@@@Year after year, we talk about the need for global moral strategic leadership.@@@I shall not go into all of the details, but in my own region, in Africa, in Latin America and in the Pacific, there are too many examples where we fall short.@@@I speak specifically now first and foremost about Haiti.@@@The world owes Haiti a resolution.@@@It is not a matter of options.@@@The world owes Haiti a resolution.@@@A year ago, we knew that the gas riots had led to serious instability, and 12 months later we cannot get out of this building and into the support that the people of Haiti need.@@@There is no doubt a need for legitimacy with respect to the Government of Haiti, and therefore a national unity Government may well be the only bridge that can carry us to safety.@@@The Caribbean Community has appointed three former Prime Ministers as an eminent persons group.@@@As we heard the Secretary-General say in this Hall, politics is the art of compromise.@@@Diplomacy is the art of compromise.@@@I say simply to those who act in the name of the people of Haiti that there must be compromise in constituting that Government of national unity, if we are to build the bridge to provide the security to stop women from being raped, stop people from being killed and stop people from being affected by cholera and other public health diseases.@@@I want to thank the Governments of Kenya and Rwanda, which, from as far back as 12 months ago, committed to providing the kind of institutional support and leadership that the Haitian police need.@@@But even when we put in the institutional support that Haiti may need, what we have not necessarily accounted for is the continued reduction in the numbers of the police, largely because of persons fleeing the land for greater opportunity and being facilitated in so doing.@@@This cannot wait much longer, and I hope that those who constitute the members of the Security Council will recognize that they cannot use Haiti as a pawn because the Haitian people have suffered for too long and at the hands of too many.@@@I turn now to the history of Cuba.@@@That Cuba can help so many in this world, and yet is the continued victim of a blockade of over 60 years, but worse than that, designated as a State sponsor of terrorism, is wrong, wrong, wrong.@@@We left Cuba last week, and what the people of Cuba are being asked to face on a daily basis because of a designation by a dying presidency is wrong.@@@The voices of the global community, many of whose members have been the beneficiaries of Cuban assistance, need to stand united and to say that we cannot fight those battles when we need all hands on deck to save the planet.@@@The artificial division of who is right and who is wrong and who is good and who is bad in the eyes of those who are powerful cannot continue to be the way in which this world functions.@@@Let us turn to Venezuela.@@@Oil prices are likely to go over $100, and those small countries that do not produce oil will be the victims of it, as will our people, including in large countries like the United States of America.@@@We must bring resolution to those issues, and they are not incapable of resolution.@@@When the United States of America and many countries in Europe determined that they were recognizing President Guaido without there being a presidency for him to assume because he faced no election, the members of the Caribbean Community came to this institution and met with the Secretary- General and with the representatives of a number of countries.@@@Little by little, we saw people apply their hearts to wisdom and to recognize that the Charter of the United Nations did not allow for that kind of unconstitutional conferral of presidency on anyone.@@@I say today that there must be transparency.@@@It cannot be that the Caribbean Community, which needs a mechanism for stabilization in an energy crisis, cannot have access to the concessionary prices that the Government and the people of Venezuela are prepared to make available to their neighbours to minimize the suffering.@@@How is it possible for Chevron and the European Union to access the oil and gas of Venezuela, while the people of the Caribbean cannot access it at the 35 per cent discount offered by the people of Venezuela.@@@How is it possible that we should have to carry a cost of an additional 4 per cent of the gross domestic product of my own country simply because the rules that allow for one do not allow for the other?@@@There must be transparency and there must be moral strategic leadership if we are to build the team to save the planet and to save and attain the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in today’s world.@@@There are many other things that we can discuss.@@@We support the United Nations accepting the responsibility for tax.@@@Why?@@@Because as quickly as the world has been able to find a mechanism for a global minimum corporate tax, it has not found a mechanism to be able to inflate the financing opportunities available to developing countries.@@@That cannot be.@@@We know how to run fast in one set of circumstances when it suits one set of people, yet we run very slow when it matters to billions of people and their access to life and livelihood.@@@I do not want to prey on the Assembly’s time anymore, but suffice it to say that we have reached a point where we must give thanks for the progress made, but recommit ourselves.@@@The mission was never simply to make progress; the mission is to be able to save the planet and to give the people of the world the best opportunity for life that is necessary for them as human beings; to be able to save the biodiversity of this world; to be able to save the soils of this world that must nurture the food that we eat; to be able to allow us to have access to safe water.@@@If we do not change how we do our business; if we do not recognize that the Security Council needs to put itself in a position not to speak to climate change, but to protect us against the climate crisis — because it is as much of a crisis as the war in Ukraine or the wars in Africa or the instability and conflict elsewhere in the world — and if we do not take a proactive approach, then we truly shall be victims of it.@@@I believe that reform is critical at this point.@@@But what I believe does not matter.@@@What matters is the action of each and every country in that respect.@@@Will we always be in a position of flux?@@@No.@@@There is hope because human beings want to survive, but the problem is that those whose actions we most need may be so confident in their survival that they do not act early enough for us.@@@That is why I ask: Will we take the road to be able to get to the gates, only to find that we are too late and the gates have closed.@@@They will be open for some, but they will be closed for many.@@@Vision without action.@@@Nelson Mandela told us, is just a dream, and action without vision just passes the time.@@@But vision with action can change the world.@@@Our citizens believe that we come into a talk shop when we come here.@@@We here know that it is potentially different, but it will be different only when those of us who have the responsibility to act on behalf of Governments can ask their Governments to come to the point of the 
decisions that we need to make to provide the funding, the tools and the solidarity to rebuild the trust that this debate calls for.@@@If we can do that, then we will not save all, but we can save the majority of people who are currently on the front line.@@@Those of us who work on the SDGs believe that, as we work to save the planet, we have to redouble our efforts.@@@I leave Members with one thought.@@@The efforts to provide education, to save people from hunger and to remove gender discrimination are not simply the actions of Governments.@@@They have now equally to be the actions of individual citizens.@@@But Governments must help personalize those SDGs for their citizens.@@@If we can do that, if we can continue to make the case for finance and if we can continue to stay focused on the climate crisis, then yes, we shall see a better world and we can shine the light on the future of many.@@@At the outset, the State of Kuwait would like to convey its deepest condolences and sincere sympathy to our sister State the Kingdom of Morocco on the victims of the recent earthquake there, which killed and injured thousands of people.@@@I would also like to express our condolences and sympathy to our brothers in the State of Libya on the losses they have suffered thanks to the recent devastating storms and floods, which have also resulted in many deaths and injuries.@@@We pray to God to have mercy on the victims’ souls and to alleviate the suffering of their families, and we wish a speedy recovery to all the injured.@@@It is a pleasure for me to congratulate Mr. Dennis Francis and his friendly country on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session.@@@We are confident that his rich experience in international affairs will help him guide our work wisely and ably.@@@I would also like to commend the efforts of his predecessor.@@@Mr. Csaba Korosi, throughout his presidency of the previous session.@@@Furthermore.@@@I want to express our appreciation for the constructive efforts and outstanding leadership of the Secretary-General, including his efforts to realize the lofty mission of our Organization, based on the Charter of the United Nations, to maintain international peace and security.@@@I am once again addressing the international community from this rostrum with regard to the challenges and obstacles that multilateralism is facing on the international stage, challenges that are testing our ability to survive and move forward or else confront a stalemate.@@@The current dangers and threats in the world — including conflicts among States, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, increasing 
terrorism and high levels of poverty, in addition to threats posed by natural disasters and climate change as well as challenges related to food insecurity, not to mention emerging threats to cybersecurity — demand that we seek international cooperation based on partnership and responsibility.@@@In that regard, we want to underscore the importance of the Secretary-General's initiative Our Common Agenda (A/75/982), which diagnoses the challenges facing the international community that require concerted efforts to address them at the national, regional and international levels.@@@Its goal is to make use of our Organization’s legacy and its various tools and mechanisms.@@@The State of Kuwait has remained steadfast in its belief in the principle of good neighbourliness and has continued for nearly 20 years to help its sister State of Iraq return to its rightful place, regionally and internationally, with a view to realizing the hopes and aspirations of its brotherly people.@@@However, we were surprised by the ruling of Iraq’s Federal Supreme Court on the unconstitutionality of the law ratifying the Convention on the Regulation of Navigation in Khor Abdullah, which was concluded between Kuwait and Iraq in 2012 and ratified and deposited at the United Nations in 2013.@@@The ruling features several historical fallacies concerning the State of Kuwait.@@@We were also surprised by the decision of the Iraqi Government a few days ago to rescind the shared security protocol signed between the Kuwaiti and Iraqi naval forces in 2008, a move that will have negative consequences for maritime security and navigation in Khor Abdullah.@@@In that regard, the State of Kuwait considers that the agreement on maritime navigation in Khor Abdullah and the security protocol should remain valid, given their importance vis-a-vis maintaining security and maritime safety.@@@They can help avert chaos, infringements of borders and the possibility of arms and narcotics trafficking, which is a source of revenue for various terrorist militias.@@@From this rostrum, a symbol of the multilateral diplomacy that helps to maintain international peace and security.@@@Kuwait affirms the need for the Iraqi Government to take tangible, decisive and urgent measures to address the consequences of its ruling on the security protocol and its historical fallacies in order to preserve good- neighbourly relations.@@@At the same time, my country emphasizes the importance of ensuring the security, independence and the territorial integrity of both countries, as well as compliance with agreements they have concluded and the relevant international resolutions, especially Security Council resolution 833 (1993), which outlines the demarcation of the land and maritime border between the two countries up to maritime boundary point 162.@@@We further call on our brother country of Iraq to act in good faith and continue participating in the meetings of the technical teams responsible for border delimitation beyond boundary point 162, in compliance with relevant international laws and conventions.@@@The State of Kuwait reserves the right to take the appropriate legal and international measures to defend its legitimate and legal rights, pursuant to international resolutions and the norms of international law, which we have always respected and applied in our relations with all States.@@@The free and brotherly Palestinian people have been suffering for 75 years owing to the failure of the international community to implement resolutions of international legitimacy.@@@They suffer from the practices of the Israeli occupation, which violate all international norms and conventions.@@@In that regard, we underscore the centrality of the Palestinian question in the Arab and Muslim worlds.@@@With respect to the implementation of General Assembly resolutions, my country submitted a written memorandum to the International Court of Justice on the consequences of the Israeli occupation and its continued violation of the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination.@@@We stress our firm and principled position in support of the rights of the Palestinian people, based on resolutions of international legitimacy and the Arab Peace Initiative, until an independent Palestinian State is established, with East Jerusalem as its capital, within the borders of 4 June 1967.@@@The brotherly country of the Sudan is experiencing tragic events due to an armed conflict, which is a source of deep concern.@@@We urge all parties involved to immediately end hostilities and return to dialogue and a peaceful political process in order to protect the security, stability and territorial integrity of the Sudan.@@@We reiterate our support to all regional and international initiatives to that end, including the initiative of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United States.@@@With regard to the situation in the brotherly country of Yemen, we reiterate our support for the efforts of the United Nations, through the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Yemen, to resume the political process and reach a comprehensive solution, based on 
the three agreed terms of reference, namely, the Gulf Cooperation Council Initiative and its implementation mechanism, the outcomes of the National Dialogue Conference and relevant Security Council resolutions, notably resolution 2216 (2015), in order to ensure the security, stability and territorial integrity of Yemen.@@@Concerning Syria, we would like to reaffirm the importance of intensifying efforts to reach a Syrian- owned political solution pursuant to relevant Security Council resolutions, specifically resolution 2254 (2015).@@@On the regional front, to strengthen the principle of good neighbourliness, stipulated by the Charter of the United Nations, we would like to reiterate our call on the Islamic Republic of Iran to take serious measures to rebuild trust, start a dialogue based on respect for States and non-interference in their internal affairs, and maintain the safety and freedom of international navigation.@@@My country would also like to underscore that the ownership of natural resources in the area adjacent to the divided Kuwaiti-Saudi zone, including the entire Durra field, is exclusively shared by the State of Kuwait and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.@@@The two countries alone have the full right to exploit those natural resources.@@@The State of Kuwait also reiterates its categorical rejection of any rights claimed by other parties concerning that field or the submerged zone adjacent to the divided zone between the State of Kuwait and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.@@@We hope to strengthen international dialogue with a view to expanding a culture of coexistence, tolerance and peace at all levels.@@@However, the followers of Islam continue to face provocative and irresponsible attacks from extremists who have burned copies of the Holy Qur’an in the capitals and cities of some States, under the fictitious pretext of freedom of expression and opinion.@@@International efforts must be made to take strong measures to end hate speech and media misinformation that target Muslims.@@@As part of its vision of development, under the slogan “A new Kuwait”, the State of Kuwait is monitoring all international economic and financial indicators to turn Kuwait into a financial, commercial and cultural hub that can engage at the regional and international levels.@@@In that way, foreign policy would be part of an expanded development process, based on diplomacy and underpinned by initiatives drawn from the human and cultural heritage bequeathed to us by our founding fathers.@@@Given the environmental degradation faced by our world, my country has voluntarily and thoughtfully made clear progress in fulfilling its commitments according to available capabilities, especially in the industrial, transportation and oil sectors, to limit pollution, diversify energy sources and improve their efficiency, and use alternative and renewable energy.@@@We have also committed to ensuring carbon neutrality in the oil sector by 2050.@@@The member States of the Gulf Cooperation Council have always been pioneers in supporting the international multilateral community, based on their conviction of the importance of working together to address common challenges.@@@We hope that the twenty-eighth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which will take place in Dubai, the sisterly United Arab Emirates, will be successful.@@@We are counting on the necessary support by the international community for the relevant guidelines to implement the various elements of the Paris Agreement.@@@My country appreciates and welcomes the declaration by the sisterly Kingdom of Saudi Arabia regarding the establishment of a global water organization, which will be based in Riyadh, to ensure complementarity in the efforts of countries and organizations to inclusively address the challenges faced in the area of water resource management so as to ensure the sustainability of water resources.@@@I would also like to express my country’s appreciation to the sisterly State of Qatar, which will host a horticultural exposition under the theme “Green Desert.@@@Better Environment” seeking to promote innovative solutions for the sustainability of desert areas.@@@In conclusion, as the State of Kuwait firmly believes in equality, justice and human rights, we look forward to receiving support from the Member States of the United Nations in the elections to be held next October for the State of Kuwait to be a member of the Human Rights Council for the period 2024-2026.@@@Throughout our membership, we will strive to realize the aspirations of the developing world by building cooperation bridges leading to inclusive and equitable solutions to human rights issues based on the provisions of international law, international humanitarian law, international human rights law and resolutions of international legitimacy.@@@We will do so without practicing selectivity or double standards and without any imposition of a fait accompli.@@@We reiterate our commitment to multilateralism as well as to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, in order to ensure better international governance so that our Organization may fulfil its noble mission of maintaining international peace and security in the service of all humankind.@@@On behalf of the delegation of the Kingdom of Thailand, allow me to congratulate Mr. Dennis France on his election to preside over the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session.@@@Thailand has marked a new chapter in our democracy.@@@I assumed office only a few days ago, with the mandate of the people, to strengthen democratic institutions and values in Thailand and to uplift the well-being of the Thai people, who have been through difficult times over the past several years.@@@In our foreign relations, we will play a proactive and constructive role in partnership with the international community.@@@My Government will also be reaching out to friends and partners all over the world to forge closer ties of partnership through commerce, investment and trade agreements.@@@Today we meet at a time of multiple global challenges, including fragile global peace, declining human development and the sustainability of our planet.@@@Those challenges require multilateralism and the spirit of international cooperation, and Thailand intends to work closely with all nations to meet them head on.@@@It was in the pursuit of peace that the United Nations was founded almost eight decades ago.@@@Now more than ever, we must continue to lay a strong foundation for the prosperity of our peoples by striving for sustainable peace.@@@In that regard.@@@Thailand welcomes the Secretary- General’s efforts in establishing a new agenda for peace.@@@We believe that this will spearhead the effort to revive multilateralism and enhance the United Nations role as a platform for the achievement of global peace.@@@Thailand’s vision for effective multilateralism is one that is inclusive, resilient and result-oriented.@@@In a world of increasing international conflicts, violence and a shifting global order, we reaffirm our commitment to maintaining peace and inclusivity.@@@Thailand will pursue peaceful and collaborative relations with all members of the international community.@@@We believe that long- lasting peace can be achieved if we can strengthen our multilateral relations, which are based on mutual trust, understanding and respect.@@@Sustainable peace and development are linked to respect for human rights, human dignity and freedoms.@@@To that end, the Thai Government is working to advance equality and justice, especially for the most vulnerable and the marginalized.@@@We plan to strengthen the rule of law and increase transparency within the Government.@@@We will ensure that the law is fair, strictly enforced and applied to everyone equally.@@@Thailand is the candidate of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) for the Human Rights Council for the term 2025-2027.@@@That reaffirms our sincere commitment to the advancement of human rights at 
home and abroad.@@@We will ensure that the Human Rights Council is well equipped to address new and emerging human rights challenges and contribute positively to the international community.@@@Since its inception in 2002.@@@Thailand’s universal health coverage has ensured that all Thai citizens are entitled to essential preventive and curative health services at all life stages.@@@In the coming years, we plan to further invest to upgrade our universal health coverage to improve the quality of the programme and to give all patients the freedom to choose the healthcare provider best suited to them.@@@That will ensure that access to high-quality health services will continue to be a universal right for all.@@@If the recent global pandemic has taught us anything, it is that access to health care is one of the most essential services a Government can provide to its people.@@@Dealing with contagious diseases is not one country’s problem, but the world’s shared responsibility.@@@The global health architecture should be reformed and strengthened.@@@We hope that the pandemic treaty can be established so that we can have a more resilient, responsive and future-ready global public health infrastructures.@@@Thailand welcomes the Sustainable Development Goals Summit, which reaffirmed that sustainability is the only way forward to protect our planet and the wellbeing of our people.@@@Yet, achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, by most benchmarks, is still proving elusive, as only 12 per cent of the goals are on track.@@@That is why we must accelerate the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@To achieve sustainable development, we must first take care of our people.@@@My Government plans to enact policies to stimulate job creation and provide financial support for low-income families and other vulnerable groups.@@@That will help level the playing field and aid in the creation of a more just society.@@@For many years.@@@Thailand has been a strong advocate for a more balanced, people-centred and sustainable path to growth.@@@The Sufficiency Economy Philosophy (SEP), our long-standing, locally driven development approach, has consistently been applied to promote balance in all aspects.@@@Building on the SEP is the Bio-Circular-Green Economy Model, which leverages science, technology and innovation to advance economic growth, while conserving the environment and ecosystems.@@@These are not merely concepts, but are being implemented in Thailand.@@@For example, we have piloted the sustainable agronomy model, which reimagines the way farmers cultivate their lands and manage water supply.@@@That will reduce not only the impact on the environment, but also reduce vulnerability to climate change and enhance the well-being of farmers nationwide.@@@Thailand is ready to form regional and global partnerships for sustainable development, including through South-South and triangular cooperation.@@@As the ASEAN Coordinator on Sustainable Development Cooperation, we are committed to forging closer partnerships among ASEAN countries and beyond to drive forward sustainable development and build resilience.@@@July was the hottest month ever recorded in human history.@@@That is in line with the Secretary-General’s statement that “the era of global warming has ended; the era of global boiling has arrived”.@@@The climate crisis is one of the most urgent threats that require our collective and immediate action.@@@To that end.@@@Thailand welcomes the Climate Ambition Summit to accelerate climate action that will mitigate the destructive impacts of the ongoing climate crisis.@@@Together, we must devise the means to adapt and enhance climate resilience.@@@As the global climate change crisis continues to worsen, so too will the issue of food insecurity and malnutrition.@@@As a leading exporter of food and agricultural products.@@@Thailand is suffering from the effects of global climate change and El Nino.@@@To ensure food security for the world, we are working hard to improve our water management systems and farming techniques.@@@We are doing our part to make sure that food security can become a reality.@@@To achieve a more sustainable future, we must invest in the planet.@@@Thailand is implementing a green finance mechanism, including the issuance of sustainability linked bonds and the Thailand Green Taxonomy, to boost growth and investments in environmental and social projects, while contributing to the effort to address the challenges of climate change.@@@To do our part.@@@Thailand is determined to deliver on our pledge — 40 per cent of greenhouse-gas emissions reduction by 2040, carbon neutrality by 2050, and net zero greenhouse-gas emissions by 2065 — by mainstreaming climate actions in all economic activities.@@@Our National Energy Plan has integrated our climate targets by enhancing energy efficiency, increasing the share of renewable energy 
and making a modal shift of transport through domestic electric vehicle production.@@@The United Nations represents the common aspiration of the global community.@@@We must redouble our efforts to ensure that the Organization continues to be the best representation of our collective humanity and solidarity.@@@As such.@@@Thailand has great expectations for the Summit of the Future to foster a better future for all based on the spirit of multilateralism, with the United Nations at the helm, in the global push towards sustainable peace and sustainable development.@@@Thailand believes that now is the time to pursue our common agenda for peace, prosperity and sustainability for all.@@@We invite every nation to be more ambitious in our goals, accelerate our actions and work harder together to address those challenges.@@@Only together can we build our better future.@@@I wish to convey my heartfelt congratulations to the President of the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session.@@@Mr. Dennis Francis, and to wish him every success in the work of the session.@@@I am confident that, under his able leadership, the seventy-eighth session of the General Assembly will facilitate comprehensive discussions on a range of critical issues facing the world and will present constructive solutions for peace, prosperity and sustainability.@@@Not only can we enjoy peace and harmony, but we can also entrust a peaceful and prosperous world to future generations by sincerely yearning for peace, security and sustainable development, as well as by devoting efforts and financial resources to consolidating the political, economic, environmental and sociocultural foundations that sustain the world.@@@Despite the world’s collective accomplishment in overcoming the threat of the global pandemic, we still face a range of challenges stemming from geostrategic and geopolitical tensions, socioeconomic crises, climate change and rapid technological advances.@@@The United Nations, the Charter of the United Nations and the international legal system continue to play an important role in strengthening global peace and security and fostering international cooperation.@@@To collectively overcome the current challenges, conflicts, confrontations and mistrust, the countries of the world should strive for greater unity, trust and friendship and should endeavour to further strengthen the role and position of the United Nations as a global community of human solidarity.@@@Mongolia commends and supports the initiatives outlined in the report of the Secretary-General Our Common Agenda (A/75/982), including the recent New Agenda for Peace, which offers proactive solutions for global challenges in international relations by strengthening preventive diplomacy and reinvigorating multilateral cooperation and dialogue.@@@The rapid advancement of digital technology is unlocking new prospects for global development.@@@Yet on the other hand, it is also reshaping the landscape of threats that jeopardize world peace and security, such as terrorist attacks and their financing, money laundering and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.@@@Therefore, in order to combat them effectively, it is vital for countries across the globe and the international community to collaborate in all areas, exchange information and refine the international legal framework.@@@In that context.@@@Mongolia fully supports the initiatives and activities of the United Nations and the United Nations system and has actively contributed to the establishment of a comprehensive international convention on countering the use of information and communications technologies for criminal purposes.@@@Today’s tense and complex geopolitical dynamics undermine both global and regional security and provoke misunderstandings among nations.@@@Consequently, the most effective means to address those complex issues is through peaceful dialogue.@@@It has been more than three decades since Mongolia declared its territory to be free of nuclear weapons, and we have fully supported the international community’s efforts to achieve disarmament and the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.@@@In order to contribute to peace and security in our region.@@@Mongolia successfully hosted the eighth Ulaanbaatar Dialogue on Northeast Asian Security in June.@@@The Under-Secretary-General and High Representative for Disarmament Affairs.@@@Mrs. Izumi Nakamitsu, participated in the Conference and highlighted that the Ulaanbaatar Dialogue mechanism is becoming a significant platform for establishing peace and security and strengthening confidence-building measures in north-east Asia.@@@I am pleased to note that Mongolia’s efforts in the pursuit of regional peace and security in the framework of its peace-loving, open and multi-pillar foreign policy are expanding, and the number of participating countries is growing year by year.@@@Secretary-General Antonio Guterres praised Mongolia as a symbol of peace in a troubled world when he visited Mongolia last year.@@@I am also delighted to note that, during his recent visit to Mongolia.@@@Pope Francis stated that.@@@“a profound spiritual sensitivity belongs to the very fibre of your cultural identity, and it is proper that Mongolia should be a symbol of religious freedom”.@@@Furthermore, the Pope issued the following call to the international community:
“may .., on this Earth devastated by countless conflicts, there be a renewal, respectful of international laws, of the conditions of what was once the pax mongolica, namely, the absence of conflicts”.@@@United Nations peacekeeping stands as one of the essential instruments for maintaining international peace and security.@@@It continues to play a pivotal role in halting and preventing armed conflicts, alleviating humanitarian crises and fostering an environment that is conducive to the progress of social development.@@@For that reason, we consider United Nations peacekeeping operations to be a vital part of the United Nations and multilateral cooperation efforts for peace.@@@Over the past 20 years, through its deployment of more than 20.000 peacekeepers to hotspots around the world.@@@Mongolia has honourably fulfilled its obligations to the international community in terms of maintaining global peace and security.@@@Mongolia emphasizes the meaningful participation of women in United Nations peacekeeping operations and believes that strengthening the role of women at all levels will have significant impacts on the maintenance of international peace and security as well as on the peaceful resolution of conflicts.@@@To contribute to the implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), we successfully organized an international conference on strengthening the role of women in peacekeeping in June 2022, at which participants shared and exchanged their experiences and ideas on best practices and lessons learned, as well as the challenges and obstacles encountered in the field.@@@We also intend to implement national policies and activities on ensuring gender equality in line with the women and peace and security agenda.@@@As nations, it is our collective aspiration to coexist harmoniously and equitably in this world, regardless of our ethnicity, race, age, gender, religion or cultural distinctions.@@@However, the principle of leaving no one behind in development, which we formulated, has not been fully realized to date.@@@Disparities still persist both in the levels of development among various countries and in the living conditions experienced by different groups of people.@@@The recent global challenges, such as the pandemic, climate change, geopolitical conflicts, financial and debt crises, poverty and hunger, have significantly hindered development, particularly in developing countries, in which progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is lagging.@@@Even though we have already passed the halfway point to the deadline for the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which is the road map for fostering trust, unity and development.@@@The Sustainable Development Goals Report 2023 reveals that only 12 per cent of the SDG targets are on track, while progress on 50 per cent of the targets is weak and insufficient and progress on 30 per cent of them has stalled or even reversed.@@@If we are unable to achieve our goals, it is evident that the path forward for development and progress for humankind will be bleak.@@@It is a critical time to be responsible and, as Secretary-General Guterres warned, not to turn the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development into a mirage of what might have been.@@@Prior to the pandemic, the annual SDG funding gap stood at $2.5 trillion, but according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, that gap has now surged to at least $4.2 trillion, while 52 least developed countries are at risk of a serious debt crisis.@@@Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a global plan for financing the SDGs.@@@Mongolia presented its second national voluntary review report at the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development held in New York last July.@@@According to the report.@@@Mongolia has made notable progress towards achieving 15 of the SDGs, while the implementation of one SDG has been assessed as regressive.@@@It has been estimated that Mongolia needs to spend an additional 18 per cent of its gross domestic product annually on average until 2030 to achieve the SDG targets.@@@Climate change is sending a distress call and a warning alarm of the impending threat that looms over human life and the existence of humankind on Earth.@@@If we do not follow a resolute path to preserving our Mother Earth right now, she will inevitably find her own way to survive, even if it means doing so without us.@@@The 2023 report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warns that, if global temperature increases by half a degree, it will lead to increased poverty, heatwaves, sea level rise, coral reef decline, habitat loss and severe drought.@@@Every increment of global warming will be immeasurably costly.@@@Therefore.@@@Governments should take urgent measures to implement the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, heed the guidance of scientists, raise public awareness, regulate resource utilization, preserve and restore biological diversity, foster ecologically friendly and economically efficient technologies, such as the use of renewable energy, and substantially bolster climate financing.@@@To that end.@@@Mongolia became one of the first countries in 2023 to adopt the SDG Finance Taxonomy by introducing major legislative reforms aimed at increasing foreign and domestic investment.@@@Mongolia is effectively implementing the One Billion Trees and the Food Supply and Food Security initiatives at the national level, and successfully hosted the World Export Development Forum 2023, which focused on the further development of green, digital and inclusive trade and economic relations.@@@Furthermore, in the Orkhon Valley, which has been inscribed on the World Heritage List, we commenced a major development project to rebuild Karakorum, the ancient capital of Mongols, into an environmentally friendly, smart eco-city for green development.@@@I am also pleased to inform the Assembly that preparations are under way in Mongolia to host the seventeenth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, to be held in Ulaanbaatar in 2026.@@@At the United Nations.@@@Mongolia actively endeavours to protect the interests of landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) and to present both the challenges and opportunities of countries with special needs to the international community.@@@Currently.@@@Mongolia is working as Vice-Chair of the Group of Landlocked Developing Countries at the United Nations and is making progress on the initiative to set up a group of LLDCs at the World Trade Organization and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).@@@At the forty-first session of the ICAO Assembly, held in Montreal.@@@Canada, in September 2022.@@@Mongolia submitted a working paper on improving air connectivity in LLDCs, which received broad support from ICAO member States.@@@Mongolia also attaches particular importance to developing the International Think Tank for Landlocked Developing Countries, an intergovernmental organization established in Ulaanbaatar in 2017, and to strengthening its research capacities.@@@We believe that, based on the practical experiences and lessons learned from the implementation of the Vienna Programme of Action, the third United Nations Conference on Landlocked Developing Countries, to be held in Kigali in 2024, will be a critical opportunity to adopt a renewed development framework for landlocked developing countries for the next decade.@@@It is commendable that the seventy-eighth session of the General Assembly drew global attention to health issues by convening three high-level meetings — on universal health coverage; pandemic preparedness, prevention and response; and the fight against tuberculosis — and adopting their respective political declarations.@@@I am confident that the outcomes of those meetings will make a significant contribution to international efforts in those fields and that they will be reflected as well in the national programme on the theme “Healthy Mongolian”, which is being implemented at my own initiative.@@@Mongolia fully supports, and expresses its commitment to contributing to, the negotiations on the adoption of a World Health Organization (WHO) convention, agreement or other international instrument on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response, as agreed by WHO member States at the second special session of the World Health Assembly.@@@We believe that the establishment of such an international legal document would be of great importance to ensuring timely and equitable access to and the distribution of pandemic-related vaccines, treatments and diagnostics.@@@On behalf of the people of Mongolia.@@@I wish to express my deep gratitude to all health-care workers around the world, who selflessly and tirelessly worked to save people’s lives and preserve their health.@@@My gratitude also goes to WHO, its staff and its Director-General.@@@Mr. Tedros A. Ghebreyesus, who played an important role in overcoming the tough times brought about by the global pandemic while minimizing the damage.@@@We call upon Member States to support and cooperate comprehensively in strengthening WHO’s role and position while broadening its range of activities.@@@This year marks the seventy-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.@@@As a democratic country.@@@Mongolia fully advocates for human rights, freedom and justice, and the principles of the promotion of gender equality and human rights in the political, social, cultural and economic spheres are enshrined in the Constitution of Mongolia.@@@Building a world free of gender inequality is our shared goal, and it is our collective duty and responsibility to collaborate towards its realization.@@@Just as women’s roles and contributions are essential for both the harmony and prosperity of nations and the well-being of families, women and female leaders play a critical role in the security and development of humankind.@@@Last June.@@@Mongolia successfully organized the Female Foreign Ministers’ Meeting, at which the participants held constructive discussions on presenting solutions to the pressing issues facing humankind and the international community, including global peace and security, climate change and food security.@@@The Ulaanbaatar Declaration was adopted as an outcome of the meeting.@@@To further advance that achievement, we propose to convene the World Women’s Forum in Mongolia in 2024.@@@We call upon countries to cooperate in support of that initiative.@@@In this era of profound transformation in the international order and norms, the role and significance of multilateral cooperation and the international community are growing enormously.@@@Mongolia therefore believes that it is important for States Members of the United Nations to actively participate in the intensification of United Nations reform, particularly in furthering negotiations on Security Council reform.@@@I have confidence that the Summit of the Future, which will be convened in September 2024 under the theme “Multilateral Solutions for a Better Tomorrow”, will be a decisive event in reaffirming the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, reviving multilateralism, fulfilling the commitments made, seeking solutions to global challenges and rebuilding trust among Member States.@@@Today our leadership is playing a pivotal role in shaping the destiny and well-being of our nations.@@@Humankind is counting on us to devise sagacious and visionary policies and initiatives that are in the best interest of future generations and that prioritize global peace, security and the environment.@@@Let us act together for peace and solidarity in the world and for the well-being of the future generations.@@@May the eternal blue sky bless humankind forever.@@@At the outset.@@@I would like to convey the warmest greetings from His Majesty the King and the people of Bhutan to the General Assembly.@@@Allow me to congratulate you.@@@Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session and assure you of my delegation’s full support.@@@Our gratitude also goes to Mr. Csaba Korosi.@@@President of the General Assembly at its seventy 
seventh session, for the excellent guidance of our work during the past year.@@@We also welcome the theme for the seventy-eighth general debate.@@@“Rebuilding trust and reigniting global solidarity: Accelerating action on the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals towards peace, prosperity, progress and sustainability for all”, which is very relevant, appropriate and timely.@@@Our appreciation is also due to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who continues to inspire and serve valiantly in advocating for peace, prosperity and wellbeing of the people and the planet.@@@The initiatives laid out in the Our Common Agenda report (A/75/982) present us with the opportunity to find new ways to work together for the common good, without undermining the existing agreements or mandates.@@@Bhutan is happy to engage constructively in preparing for the Summit of the Future and to work towards the elaboration of a global digital compact, which would, among other things, accelerate the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).@@@The reforms of the United Nations, which are centred firmly on implementing the 2030 Agenda, will provide the essential impetus to galvanize support and progress in areas that have been found to be insufficient to meet the Goals and targets within the set timeframe of 2030.@@@This discussion assumes even greater urgency as we have passed the midpoint towards implementing the 2030 Agenda.@@@That is further exacerbated by the conflicts and the looming climate emergency, which have thrown efforts towards achieving the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs off track.@@@We need to refocus our priorities by shifting gears and turning our commitments into action.@@@In that regard, we support the Secretary-GeneraTs SDG Stimulus, which is aimed at significantly increasing affordable, long-term financing for development and scaling up affordable financing to ensure that the 2030 Agenda regains its traction.@@@Under the guidance of our visionary leaders.@@@Bhutan embarked on its development path with a holistic guiding philosophy that we call Gross National Happiness (GNH).@@@When the world leaders adopted the 2030 Agenda in 2015, it was apparent that the SDGs presented high levels of synergy with our own development philosophy of GNH.@@@Therefore, mainstreaming the SDGs into our national plans and their implementation came very naturally.@@@I am happy to share that Bhutan is well on track to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and on our part reaffirm our commitment to undertaking concrete actions to fulfil the 2030 Agenda.@@@After more than five decades of planned economic development.@@@Bhutan is set to graduate from the list of least developed countries (LDCs) at the end of this year.@@@That is the result of strong and benevolent leadership, guidance from successive monarchs, the hard work of our people and, above all, the generous assistance of all our development partners.@@@I take this opportunity to thank all our bilateral and multilateral partners, well- wishers and friends for their generosity and support, without which we would not have been able to realize that important milestone.@@@While that achievement in our development journey is an occasion for celebration, we do so in the full knowledge of the vulnerabilities under which we graduate and the challenges that lie ahead.@@@The Royal Government looks forward to a smooth transition, and the thirteenth Five-Year National Development Plan, which is set to commence early next year, will be critical to ensuring that our graduation is smooth, sustainable and irreversible.@@@Here, we look forward to the continued good will, support and assistance of our development partners.@@@We are also hopeful that there will be universal support for the full implementation of the Doha Programme of Action, which is critical to the LDCs, graduating countries and newly graduated countries.@@@Devastation and destruction from extreme weather events and natural disasters are taking place at levels never seen before, with studies pointing to climate change as the main responsible factor.@@@I would like to convey Bhutan’s sympathies and deepest condolences to all those affected by those unfortunate events in the past year.@@@Bhutan has also been affected by extreme weather phenomena, with the increasing frequency and ferocity of natural disasters such as glacial lake outburst floods, flash floods, windstorms and landslides.@@@Unpredictable rain and weather patterns have wrecked the lives of farmers and people across the country.@@@Those are serious causes of concern that have consequential impacts on the assets and livelihoods of our people and our hard-earned development gains.@@@Bhutan falls within the Hindu Kush Himalayan region.@@@The report of one working group of the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change confirms that the rate of ice-sheet loss has increased at an alarming rate over the past three decades, with the region experiencing glacier-mass loss of 65 per cent.@@@Even if global warming is limited to 1.5°C, one-third of the glaciers in the Hindu Kush Himalayan region will disappear by the end of the century.@@@For countries like ours, that means permanent loss of water resources for agriculture, hydropower generation and natural resources, and increased risk of disaster events.@@@The melting of our glaciers also contributes substantially to rising sea-level and triggers a host of cascading effects, including coastal erosion, flooding and permanent land submersion.@@@On our part, we have done all we can and Bhutan’s leadership in sustainable development and environmental stewardship has been well recognized globally.@@@We are fortunate that the past investments in environmental conservation are reaping climate dividends.@@@Our forests not only serve as a carbon sink for greenhouse-gas emissions, but also provide the valuable ecosystem service of delivering clean water for drinking, agriculture and hydropower generation.@@@We are committed to remaining carbon neutral and reaffirm our pledge to fulfil our commitments to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.@@@While welcoming the breakthrough agreement to provide loss and damage funding for vulnerable countries on the frontline of the climate crisis during the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP27), we are hopeful that progress will be made and that it will be operationalized by COP28.@@@In addition, we need to mobilize new and additional climate financing, while ensuring balance between financing for mitigation and adaptation.@@@We also need to forge strong international cooperation in coming up with viable projects and partnerships to scale up investments in alternative renewable energy to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, particularly in the manufacturing and transport sectors.@@@Although a small developing country, with a population of less than a million.@@@Bhutan has always worked constructively with other Member States to realize the noble objectives of the United Nations since its accession to membership in 1971.@@@Among other things.@@@Bhutan remains fully committed to the cause of international peace and security, which is one of the key mandates and objectives of the United Nations.@@@Bhutan joined the fraternity of troop- and police-contributing countries in 2014 to contribute its part towards maintaining international peace and security.@@@That signifies our commitment to sharing the burden along with other Member States.@@@Since then.@@@Bhutan has been working towards gradually broadening and deepening our engagement in the United Nations peacekeeping operations.@@@I am happy to share that in November 2022.@@@Bhutan deployed its first uniformed contingent to the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic.@@@Bhutan has also pledged an integrated formed police unit (FPU) and we are working towards fulfilling that pledge.@@@We stand ready to deploy our FPU whenever the United Nations calls upon us to do so.@@@The Royal Government would like to express our appreciation to the United Nations Department of Peace Operations and the Department of Operational Support for their guidance and support to Bhutan’s participation in that very important mandate.@@@Effective multilateralism must address the concerns of the less powerful nations of the world.@@@The global governance architecture has not delivered the equity and inclusion that are required to ensure that the ideals of the common agenda are carried out.@@@The increasing fragmentation and polarization and the growing inequity we witness in the world today only serve as an urgent cry for strengthening multilateralism, forging greater political resolve and solidarity, and practicing compassion.@@@Bhutan has consistently maintained that the reform of the Security Council must progress hand-in-hand with the reform of the entire United Nations system.@@@The reform must accommodate the interests and concerns of all Member States, particularly of those that are unrepresented or underrepresented.@@@We believe that the Security Council must evolve to stay relevant and effective to address the multifaceted challenges of our times, and in that regard Bhutan supports the expansion of both the permanent and non-permanent categories of Council membership.@@@We continue to believe that in a reformed Council.@@@India and Japan must be included as permanent members, as must members of the African Union.@@@Under the leadership of His Majesty the King, the Government has initiated and implemented a number of reforms across all Government agencies and sectors.@@@Having learnt valuable lessons from the coronavirus 
disease (COVID-19) pandemic, we are convinced that business as usual cannot be the norm.@@@Urged on by the expectations of our people, the need to overcome our vulnerabilities and to progress as an advanced nation, we have undertaken major transformations so as to enhance public services, accelerate the economy and sustain the development gains while promoting and preserving our core values, which are our tradition and culture and, most important, our environment.@@@There are a number of foundations on which those reforms are built.@@@One of the most important and critical of those is leveraging technology for nation-building, without which we will be left behind.@@@With the enactment of the National Digital Identity Act.@@@Bhutan became the first country in the world to enact a legal framework for implementing self-sovereign identity.@@@That will serve as the foundation on which all other services will be accessed and provided to citizens digitally.@@@Over the past decade, strong political, social and economic institutions established under the guidance of our monarchs have taken firm root to set the foundations for a functional and vibrant democracy.@@@As we look to the future.@@@Bhutan will continue working with all Member States to ensure that the United Nations continues to play an instrumental role in promoting peace and security and a United Nations that is fit for purpose in the twenty-first century.@@@In conclusion, may I submit that the world has largely forgotten the COVID-19 pandemic, despite the fact that it killed close to 20 million people globally.@@@We should, however, remember the vulnerabilities that we all faced, how ill-prepared we were and the sufferings that all of us experienced collectively.@@@We have all seen the best and worst of humanity and global cooperation.@@@Today, as we emerge victorious from the pandemic, we must learn from those lessons and prevent any such catastrophe from occurring in the future.@@@From the Spanish flu in 1920 to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002, it took nearly 80 years for a global pandemic to emerge, and ever since we have seen rapid incidences of such potential pandemics, such as the Middle East respiratory syndrome in 2012.@@@Ebola in 2014 and Zika in 2016.@@@As the name SARS- CoV-2 suggests.@@@SARS-CoV-3 may just be around the corner, brought about by climate change, massive loss of habitat and ever-increasing interaction between humans and animals.@@@We must all acknowledge our interdependence and the importance of working closely together and collaborating with each other to combat our common challenges.@@@While each of our countries has its own priorities, we must not forget that we share this world together, and that therefore we should all prioritize global well-being, preparedness and cooperation.@@@Together, we can.@@@I bring warm greetings from the Kingdom of Tonga and congratulate the President on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session.@@@I also thank his predecessor.@@@Mr. Csaba Korosi, for his able stewardship in promoting solutions built on solidarity, science and seeking sustainability.@@@Our delegation fully supports the President’s vision of peace, prosperity, progress and sustainability for the seventy-eighth session.@@@The Assembly’s essential work is in expert hands with his leadership, and we hope it will continue and improve.@@@The theme for this session.@@@“Rebuilding trust and reigniting global solidarity: accelerating action on the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals towards peace, prosperity, progress and sustainability for all”, is more urgent than ever, and I thank Secretary-@@@General Guterres for his stewardship of the United Nations during these very challenging times.@@@I would like to offer my heartfelt condolences to the Governments and the peoples of Lahaina.@@@Hawaii, in the United States, and of Morocco and Libya.@@@The people of my country feel for the families of the victims as they are dealing with the tragic losses of lives in the disasters that occurred recently in their countries.@@@We are convening at a time when people, countries, regions and our world are confronting multiple challenges in quick succession.@@@Climate change threats have reached an existential level.@@@The heightened frequency and severity of cyclones, rising sea levels caused by melting polar ice, plastic and pollution in our oceans, heatwaves and fires are bringing suffering to my country and its people and to our Pacific region.@@@There are many related consequences.@@@We are confronted with ever-increasing rates of non-communicable diseases, persistent inequalities, declining basic living conditions and mounting violence against women and girls.@@@There has also been a substantial surge in the trafficking and use of unlawful narcotics, cross-border criminal activities, disinformation and cybercrime.@@@Many of those are borderless challenges that concern us all and call for collaboration.@@@The increasing geopolitical mistrust and conflicts are worrisome, particularly given the pressing need for multilateral action.@@@These disruptions affect the lives of millions, provoke excessive inflation and raise fuel and food prices.@@@Many people worldwide have a growing sense of uncertainty about how they will meet their own basic daily requirements.@@@Our window to engage in discussion beyond talks is closing rapidly.@@@It is our responsibility to act.@@@The way to retain people’s trust and inspire hope is by taking action and achieving results.@@@This session demands that we take urgent and collective action.@@@However, that can be achieved only in the presence of trust and enduring peace.@@@Trust is the foundation for any productive and sustainable human interaction, including international cooperation.@@@Trust and respect are the drivers of thriving and sustainable change.@@@Without trust, or worse, when trust is eroding, our joint efforts to foster peace, security 
and sustainable development are rendered futile and become unattainable.@@@It is therefore our duty to rebuild the trust on which the United Nations was founded.@@@It will take more than dialogue.@@@It calls for concrete action that demonstrates our commitment to shared values.@@@Multilateralism has proved to be our most cost-effective instrument for fostering global solidarity and tackling global challenges, and it must continue to be.@@@We must reflect on whether we are truly serving the intended goals of the Charter of the United Nations.@@@Why have we fallen so far behind?@@@What have we not done right?@@@In my remarks I will delve into the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).@@@The challenge at hand is to prevent the SDGs from being relegated to the status of yet another unattainable goal.@@@Despite the difficulties, it is imperative that we investigate the root causes of our significant lag in attaining our development targets.@@@The Sustainable Development Goals Report 2023: Special Edition tells us that more than half of the world has been left behind.@@@We deny people, we deny kids and we deny hope.@@@More than 50 per cent of the SDG targets are considered weak and inadequate.@@@Gender, poverty, hunger and climate targets make up 30 per cent of the targets that have either stalled or reversed.@@@That is not acceptable.@@@One key aspect of that relates to financing for development, of course.@@@Tonga supports reviewing the international financial architecture to ensure that it is fit for purpose.@@@It is imperative that we promptly provide predictable, stable and substantial support for nations struggling with financial difficulties.@@@Tonga and other small island developing States (SIDS) require greater access to concessional finance to support our development endeavours and strengthen our resilience to external shocks.@@@We fully support the call for debt relief for countries that find themselves in dire circumstances, particularly those that have been severely affected by natural disasters or other external shocks.@@@We are firmly convinced that addressing the underlying reasons for debt vulnerability in small island States is critical.@@@It is particularly relevant because SIDS are acutely vulnerable to the multifaceted and urgent challenges posed by climate change.@@@We have been raising the issue for decades.@@@The dangers are more pressing than ever, putting not only lives and livelihoods at risk but also our economies and our fundamental identity.@@@We are running out of time.@@@We call on the international community, both the public and private sectors, to collaborate with us on identifying sustainable solutions to these problems.@@@Our collaboration is crucial, as it is the only way we can achieve our commitment to a more sustainable and robust future for all.@@@Day by day, climate change becomes more of an existential menace to Tonga and the Pacific.@@@Tonga has been making genuine efforts to combat the effects of climate change on our means of subsistence for a very long time.@@@Our goals include decreasing the electricity sector’s reliance on fossil fuels by 70 per cent by 2025, planting a million plants by the end of this year and joining the 30x30 initiative.@@@The Sixth Assessment Report of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change underscores that the 1.5 C goal is achievable if emissions peak by 2025 and are halved by 2030.@@@It can therefore be done — but do we have the will?@@@We urge all Member States to do their utmost to keep emissions below 1.5 C and strongly encourage the completion of the first global stocktaking.@@@Here and there we get glimpses of hope.@@@The decision on the loss and damage fund announced at the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 27) was a historic one.@@@Yet it is now with a sense of urgency that we must operationalize the loss and damage fund.@@@We urge for providing vulnerable SIDS countries with increased and streamlined admission to the loss and damage mechanism.@@@While maintaining full accountability, we must establish more efficient and speedy means of accessing standard operating procedures.@@@Owing to the magnitude and urgency of this issue in our region, we wholeheartedly back the formation of a Pacific fund offering direct assistance to Pacific small island States in their efforts to tackle the effects of climate change.@@@Indeed, my country is determined to take a lead on the issue, having been appointed a champion of climate financing for the Pacific.@@@I can only say it again — for decades now the Pacific leaders have been calling on the international community to take urgent climate action.@@@Have our voices been acknowledged and our pleas earnestly addressed?@@@The climate financing commitments made by developed countries fall significantly short of the promised $100 billion per year, starting in 2020.@@@That brings me to climate justice.@@@Tonga was encouraged by the General Assembly’s historic adoption by consensus of resolution 77/276, led by Vanuatu and a core group of countries, requesting an advisory 
opinion from the International Court of Justice on the obligations of States regarding climate change.@@@It marks an important milestone in our decades-long struggle for climate justice.@@@Earlier this year.@@@I attended the midterm review of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030.@@@Again, as my colleagues from the Pacific have already reiterated, our countries need to see more progress, as we remain at the forefront of the battle against climate-related hazards.@@@Again, timely access to finance prevents small island States from making that progress on their own.@@@Today, and as we have done frequently in the past.@@@I therefore call for action to review the largely uncoordinated funding mechanisms, prioritize short-term post-disaster financing needs and address long-term risk reduction.@@@I also call for far greater investments in increasing resilience, especially in the education and health sectors.@@@Possessing the tools to demonstrate resilience is a significant part of that preparation.@@@Long-term risk mitigation and reduction are also intrinsically linked to early-warning systems.@@@We acknowledge the Secretary-General’s Early Warnings For All initiative announced at COP 27 last year and affirm Tonga’s commitment to its implementation.@@@We reaffirm that strengthening multi-hazard early- warning systems is highly relevant in implementing the Sendai Framework.@@@Tonga has taken the lead in that area for our region by implementing a nationwide early- warning system throughout Tonga with communication and siren systems.@@@As has often been said, we are small land States and vast ocean nations.@@@In fact, our very being and our identity cannot be separated from our precious ocean.@@@The Secretary-General’s report on oceans and the law of the sea (A/77/331) emphasizes that the ocean remains under constant threat from human activities.@@@Marine biodiversity is being disturbed due to overexploitation and ocean acidification.@@@More than a third of fish stocks are being harvested at unsustainable levels and coastal waters are polluted with chemicals, plastics and human waste.@@@Urgent remedial actions are imperative if we are to minimize the imminent threat and mitigate the damage we are currently facing.@@@We are encouraged by the Assembly’s adoption through resolution 77/321 of the Agreement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction.@@@We now have a foundation to ensure that our work on the conservation and protection of marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction continues into the future, and Tonga looks forward to joining States parties in its implementation.@@@We are pleased that the new Agreement recognizes the special circumstances of SIDS such as those in the Pacific.@@@It is now imperative to ensure that this recognition is translated into tangible capacity-building, the transfer of marine technology and sufficient support to enable the Pacific to emerge as an even more proactive leader on initiatives that safeguard, preserve and sustainably utilize the ocean and its resources.@@@In support of the Pacific Islands Forum Declaration on Preserving Maritime Zones in the Face of Climate Change-related Sea Level Rise.@@@Tonga has committed to securing the limits of the Blue Pacific continent.@@@We are doing it to promote the stability, security, certainty and predictability of maritime entitlements, irrespective of the impacts of climate -change -related sea level rise.@@@Along with Finland.@@@Tonga had the honour of co-chairing the twenty-third meeting of the United Nations Open-ended Informal Consultative Process on Oceans and the Law of the Sea.@@@Its theme — “New maritime technologies: Challenges and opportunities” — highlighted the potential benefits of new maritime technologies.@@@New technologies ought to help address threats facing the ocean, build resilient oceans and coastal communities and mitigate the impacts of climate change.@@@That is a condition for achieving the goals of the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development.@@@It is also essential to accomplishing the aims of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, notably Sustainable Development Goal 14.@@@Tonga continues to be fully committed to the effective implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the 1994 Agreement on implementing Part XI of the Convention.@@@We reaffirm the sovereign rights of States recognized and enshrined within UNCLOS and the 1994 Agreement.@@@We attach the greatest possible importance to the sustainable use of ocean resources, whether living or non-living.@@@Tonga recognizes the important role played by the International Seabed Authority (ISA) in administering and managing the Area in line with its legal mandate under Part XI of UNCLOS.@@@As one of the evolving organs of UNCLOS, it is vital that States parties avoid instances of arbitrary interpretation of the 
Convention.@@@Tonga is committed to engaging in good faith in the negotiations of the exploitation regulations to ensure their embodiment of good industry practices and best environmental management practices.@@@We acknowledge the contribution of the ISA towards the advancement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, contributing to 12 of the 17 SDGs.@@@We commend its efforts to boost the capacity of developing States, including Pacific Small Island Developing States, through better access to critical data and support in consolidating national frameworks and regulations relating to activities in the Area.@@@Tonga was honoured to host the small island developing States of the Pacific region in Nukualofa to prepare for the fourth International Conference on SIDS, to be held in Antigua and Barbuda in 2024.@@@We live in times of profound paradigm shifts.@@@Uncertainty characterizes the global political, financial and economic situation.@@@The past few years have brought about multiple crises having a disproportionate impact on the scope for sustainable development in SIDS over the next decade.@@@We, as a region, and as a country, are united and determined in our pursuit of inclusive sustainable development for our citizens.@@@It is a course that we seek to pursue together with members, and we invite their partnership.@@@We are grateful for the Assembly’s resolution calling for the development of an index capable of capturing our special circumstances and vulnerabilities on our road to resilient and sustainable development.@@@We must ensure that the multidimensional vulnerability index is not another academic exercise.@@@The index must be regarded, first and foremost, as an action tool, focusing primarily on ensuring a more comprehensive understanding of vulnerability.@@@We need a tool that can provide meaningful and effective assistance, where and when needed.@@@We therefore call for the adoption of the index by the Assembly and its operationalization, incorporating a criterion for access by Pacific small island States to low-cost and longterm financing.@@@At a high-level event this week on unblocking blue Pacific prosperity, co-chaired by the leaders of Palau.@@@Tonga and the Bezos Earth Fund, the conference called for development partners and stakeholders to transform the Pacific region, with three key goals: first, effective ocean management; secondly, healthy and happy communities; and lastly, fit-for-purpose sustainable financing.@@@I stress the vital role of political champions and support them in the journey to secure the Blue Pacific continent’s contribution to global stability, biodiversity restoration, the promotion of healthy food systems and the improvement of people’s well-being.@@@My term as President of the sixth session of the SIDS DOCK Assembly will end in December.@@@I express my profound gratitude to our members for the confidence placed in me and for the support provided during my tenure.@@@The essence of life, existence and advancement lies in hope.@@@Our young generation must be given more than the bleak outlook of more than 50 per cent of our SDG targets being weakly and insufficiently met.@@@Today’s young people are the future custodians of the planet.@@@We must actively promote and engage youth in a substantial manner to propel the attainment of the SDGs.@@@In commemoration of United Nations Day, on 24 October, the Kingdom of Tonga and the Family Office for Sustainable Development will host the Environmental Symphony here in the General Assembly Hall.@@@The purpose of the event goes beyond celebrating and reaffirming the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, which have guided humankind for the past 78 years.@@@We want to mobilize Partnerships for the Goals in the lead-up to the 2023 twenty-eighth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 28), to be held in Dubai.@@@I should like to add that we hope to welcome everyone to our region for COP 31, as we fully support Australia’s bid for a 2026 Pacific COP.@@@This century is still young, but never has it been more urgent in this century to rekindle our commitment to the values and principles upon which the United Nations was founded.@@@We must live up to our pledge to uphold the Charter and demonstrate through action the timeless relevance of its purposes and principles.@@@That is what I call living by example — global solidarity.@@@Unless we breathe life and vigour into the Charter, we are helpless and condemned to relive the mistakes and horrors of the past.@@@Let us draw inspiration and fortitude from the courageous actions of the founding members who established this esteemed institution, which we are now entrusted with for posterity.@@@The theme of peace, prosperity, progress and sustainability for all is our road map for what we must deliver.@@@It is about a world where every person can live with dignity, free from fear and discrimination.@@@That requires courage, commitment, cooperation and recognizing with humility our shared humanity.@@@Allow me to conclude by reminding the Assembly of how it was founded.@@@The heart of the Charter lies in the determination to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war.@@@We therefore must do our utmost to build trust in multilateralism through action.@@@We must maintain and disseminate our commitment to the principles of the Charter.@@@History will judge us by this.@@@Our greatest achievements from our unity.@@@For united we stand, divided we fall.@@@God bless everyone and the United Nations.@@@Of the people, by the people, for the people.@@@We all know the most famous words of the Gettysburg Address.@@@However, fewer people know that Abraham Lincoln borrowed these words from one of the greatest Hungarians.@@@Lajos Kossuth, the leader of our 1848 war of independence.@@@He was born on this very day.@@@19 September.@@@All for the people, and all by the people.@@@Nothing about the people without the people.@@@This is the main purpose of the sovereign Hungarian State and the guarantee of our freedom.@@@The Hungarian people want peace and security.@@@We have 1.000 years of turbulent history in the heart of Europe — in the draughty Carpathian Basin — with wars, oppression and occupation, revolutions and wars of independence.@@@We know the feeling of vulnerability.@@@We know what it is like to live divided and what suffering wars cause.@@@We know how precious freedom is and how painful it is to be deprived of it.@@@I myself was born during the decades of Soviet oppression, when my country was not free.@@@A childhood spent in a softening communist dictatorship left indelible marks on my generation.@@@The rejection of any kind of oppression has become an instinct in us.@@@That is why we condemn clearly and unequivocally the violation of international law, the attack on another State, the Russian aggression against Ukraine, which has caused immense suffering and destruction and has destroyed the peaceful life of Europe.@@@We are for the victims and against further escalation.@@@This is why we are providing humanitarian aid to Ukraine and to all those fleeing the war.@@@We help beyond our size and strength.@@@This is why we emphasize that there are 150.000 Hungarians living in Ukraine, in Transcarpathia, who share every hardship and struggle, sacrifice and success.@@@This war also directly affects us Hungarians.@@@It is not just in our neighbourhood.@@@Hungarian fathers and sons living in Ukraine are also giving their lives in the trenches.@@@Thus, we want peace — in our country, in Ukraine, in Europe, in the world.@@@We want peace and the security that comes with it.@@@Hungary stands for the territorial integrity and independence of Ukraine.@@@We understand Ukraine’s desire to be part of the community of European countries, and we therefore expect it to uphold the values that characterize our community, including — expressly — the protection and full guarantee of the rights of national minorities — not in words, in deeds.@@@At the invitation of President Zelenskyy.@@@I have been to Kyiv twice since the outbreak of the war.@@@I have seen the suffering of the families.@@@I have seen what they experience when the peace is broken.@@@I have met Ukrainian and Hungarian people who have lost family members.@@@I have met Ukrainian children for whom a kindergarten was set up with the help and support of Hungary — children whom the war is depriving of a happy childhood.@@@The war and the suffering affects families first and foremost: mothers who lose their husbands and sons; fathers who go into battle with their barely grown-up sons; and children who lose their sense of security and faith in the future.@@@There is no alternative to peace.@@@The killing, the terrible destruction, must stop as soon as possible.@@@War is never the solution.@@@We know that peace is only realistically attainable when at least one side sees the time for negotiations as having come.@@@We cannot decide for Ukrainians how much they are prepared to sacrifice, but we have a duty to represent our own nation’s desire for peace.@@@And we must do all we can to avoid an escalation of the war.@@@I am a mother of three children, and we mothers know that in every war, children are the most vulnerable.@@@War hits them hardest, although they are the ones who need security and stability the most.@@@These are lost in war.@@@Hungary has always been respectful towards other nations.@@@We are loyal to our allies and our partners alike, as proud and active members of the United Nations, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the European Union and the Council of Europe.@@@We do our share of the joint tasks, even beyond our size and 
economic weight.@@@As an equestrian nation, we speak honestly, with a straight posture.@@@Here we are at the United Nations in New York — Heads of State and Government, world leaders.@@@We have come together as we do every year in the United Nations, which was created by our ancestors’ desire for peace.@@@Demand a ceasefire and a just peace!@@@Of the people, by the people, for the people.@@@I would also like to take this opportunity to send a message to the world from young Hungarians.@@@I have asked the youth delegate of Hungary to the United Nations.@@@Csenge Offenbacher, who is here with us today, to help us articulate the message of Hungarian youth.@@@This is the sentence they gave me: “Today we need solidarity with each other more than ever.@@@So young people feel that we must look out for each other, that we must not let go of the hands of others reaching out towards us”.@@@This spring in Budapest, in our nation’s main square, which is named after Lajos Kossuth, whom I mentioned earlier.@@@Pope Francis prayed in the presence of tens of thousands of people with the following words.@@@“Instil into the hearts of peoples and their leaders the desire to build peace and to give the younger generations a future of hope, not war, a future full of cradles, not tombs”.@@@The fifth Budapest Demographic Summit, the most important international forum on demographic issues, was concluded three days ago.@@@In addition to war, a large part of the world is facing a difficulty that is oppressing it from within.@@@In Europe and in many other countries of the United Nations, the demographic winter has turned into an ice age.@@@Public leaders, thinkers, demographers and the representatives of family organizations and professional workshops from 60 countries and five continents sought answers on how to protect and strengthen families and overcome our demographic difficulties.@@@If we do not address the issue, it will have an immeasurable impact on our economies, societies and security in the near future.@@@Elon Musk may be right when he says that demographic decline is a more serious problem than the climate crisis.@@@Little attention is being paid to the real and irreversible changes taking place in our world.@@@If there are no children, there will be no future.@@@What is the point of looking after the Earth if we do not have children and grandchildren to pass it on to?@@@If childlessness becomes widespread, if we continue to see fewer children born each year than the number who die in our countries, our beloved world, which we believe to be secure, will be shattered.@@@We Hungarians see a solution to the demographic crisis in the strengthening and support of families.@@@Our aim is for everyone to have a full and happy family life and to have all the children that young couples want.@@@Hungary was the first country in the world to bring the issue of strengthening families and tackling the demographic crisis into focus.@@@We have built up a broad family support system.@@@Our country’s spending on family support is the largest in the European Union, and it has not destroyed the Hungarian economy.@@@On the contrary, the strengthening of families has been a positive in economic terms.@@@We protect parental freedom.@@@We believe firmly that the right to raise children does not belong to the State, to non-governmental organizations, the media or the knowledge industry.@@@It belongs to parents.@@@Any of us who have children are ready to fight at any time to ensure that they can live in peace and freedom.@@@Families pass on their values from generation to generation, in the face of every difficulty, every historic trauma and every challenge.@@@The message of the Demographic Summit of Budapest, our capital city, which is 150 years old this year, is clear.@@@Pro-family forces stand up for their values and interests even at a time when anti-family and anti-child ideologies are on an unprecedented offensive — and, in fact, especially then.@@@We recognize that family is the key to security.@@@A strong, united and healthy family is a guarantee of security.@@@It is my honour to address the General Assembly on behalf of Ethiopia.@@@I would also like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to Mr. Dennis Francis on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session.@@@I assure him of my country’s full support in the performance of his duties.@@@We are gathered at a time when the world faces a multitude of challenges.@@@In such times, we must ask ourselves whether we have the necessary political will to choose global partnership over geopolitical competition.@@@Are we prepared to work together towards a promising age of shared prosperity?@@@Are we committed to working together to save our planet and to meet the aspirations of more than 8 billion people?@@@The uncomfortable truth is that we are increasingly witnessing policy choices that escalate tensions, threatening the peace and stability of the world.@@@Poverty and hunger are increasing.@@@Progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is off-track, pushing even further back the objective of eliminating extreme poverty by 2030.@@@Global inflation and the rise in the cost of living are undermining development gains, further worsening the challenges of the most vulnerable communities.@@@Investment in human capital and skills development remain critical for developing countries.@@@Climate change continues to have devastating impacts across the globe.@@@Africa and other vulnerable regions are enduring disproportionate adverse effects.@@@The target of mobilizing $100 billion by 2030 to support the mitigation and adaptation efforts of developing countries has not been achieved.@@@The upcoming twenty-eighth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in the United Arab Emirates, should therefore be seized as an opportune moment to take bold actions.@@@The threat of nuclear weapons is another source of grave concern for humankind.@@@The international community needs to prioritize dialogue in order to de-escalate tensions and prevent the threat of nuclear weapons.@@@We should also ensure that new technologies such as artificial intelligence are used responsibly, in a manner that benefits humankind.@@@The global community can address those challenges through meaningful cooperation.@@@The letter and spirit of the Charter of the United Nations demands that we come together to tackle those challenges with the highest sense of urgency and partnership.@@@Ethiopia calls on all Member States to recommit to the Charter of the United Nations.@@@Maintaining the status quo will not advance our shared interest of ensuring peace and prosperity.@@@We should collectively work for an inclusive multilateral system to renew our global solidarity.@@@A new global collective security system that respects the sovereignty of Member States and prevents conflict is vital.@@@As a long-time champion of, and active participant in.@@@United Nations-mandated peacekeeping operations across the globe.@@@Ethiopia underscores that reforming the Security Council is not a choice but an absolute necessity.@@@We need a reformed and representative Security Council that is fit for purpose.@@@Allocating permanent seats to Africa, as set out in our continental Common Position, is politically and morally justified.@@@Ethiopia commends the efforts of the Secretary-General with regard to the financing of African Union peace support operations from assessed contributions.@@@National ownership of security responsibilities is imperative.@@@For peacekeeping operations to achieve their objectives, robust capacity-building support should be provided to national law enforcement structures.@@@Unilateral sanctions and coercive economic measures violate United Nations principles and international law.@@@Ethiopia opposes such measures imposed on developing countries and calls for their unconditional removal.@@@We wish to underline that 
diplomatic dialogue among sovereign nations should be the primary tool for resolving differences.@@@Ethiopia and other developing countries have also been advocating for the reform of the United Nations system as a whole.@@@We call for a more inclusive and effective multilateral mechanism that works fairly for developing countries.@@@The group comprised of Brazil.@@@Russia.@@@India.@@@China and South Africa has championed that call, and that is why Ethiopia is grateful to have been invited to join the group.@@@While the world has the financial resources to fund all the development targets set out in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, its implementation has fallen behind.@@@Therefore, what we need is firm political commitment and renewed global partnership.@@@The Addis Ababa Action Agenda should also be fully implemented to meet the SDGs.@@@Ethiopia has aligned its 10-year development plan with the SDGs.@@@We are resolute in accelerating our inclusive political and economic reforms for a more peaceful and prosperous society.@@@We are also committed to finding comprehensive solutions to the climate crisis.@@@The Ethiopian-owned flagship programme — the national Green Legacy Initiative — is a demonstration of that commitment.@@@The objective of the programme is to cultivate a green culture and ensure the country’s development through rural and urban green initiatives.@@@The programme has been successful, and we are making every effort to share our experience.@@@The Pretoria peace agreement ended a two-yearlong conflict in northern Ethiopia.@@@The agreement is a practical embodiment of African solutions to African problems.@@@Its implementation continues to make significant progress, despite some delays in the execution of the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration process.@@@There is a need to expedite the process and ensure its successful completion.@@@The continued implementation of the agreement is a clear manifestation of the Government’s commitment to resolving political differences through dialogue and constitutional means.@@@We are also actively undertaking rehabilitation and reconstruction programmes in conflict-affected areas.@@@I would like to reaffirm that the Government is committed to consolidating peace and stability throughout the country.@@@We continue to pursue dialogue for sustainable and peaceful solutions.@@@In order to ensure accountability, reconciliation, truth-telling and healing.@@@Ethiopia is finalizing its transitional justice policy.@@@Nationwide consultations on policy options for transitional justice have been effectively conducted in all regions across the country.@@@Through the National Dialogue Commission.@@@Ethiopia has also embarked on inclusive dialogue to address both past and current societal concerns.@@@We are confident that will contribute to realizing a prosperous future for all citizens.@@@Conflict-induced crises in the Horn of Africa require a regional approach, with the support of the international community.@@@We express our solidarity with the brotherly nation of the Republic of the Sudan, which is facing difficult times.@@@We are confident that the Sudan will find a way to resolve the conflict peacefully and re-establish order.@@@Ethiopia has been supporting the efforts for peace, with full respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Sudan.@@@It is important to ensure that all peace initiatives be coordinated.@@@Ethiopia continues to fulfil its responsibility by promoting regional integration to advance peace, stability, economic cooperation and people-to-people ties.@@@We are working to realize the development potential of our region.@@@Ethiopia is determined to cooperate with its neighbours to expand trade, investment and regional integration through infrastructure development, efficient logistics and connectivity.@@@Any bottleneck that might constrain the shared prosperity of the region needs to be addressed in a concerted approach.@@@Fostering closer partnership is critical for creating access to seamless connectivity.@@@Cultivating mutual trust and friendship is the right choice for regional cooperation and interdependence.@@@Regional cooperation positively impacts the lives of people, especially when complemented by well- developed infrastructure projects.@@@The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam is one such project that meets the legitimate development aspirations of Ethiopians and the region at large.@@@Ethiopia welcomes the resumption of the trilateral talks with Egypt and the Sudan.@@@We remain committed to a negotiated win-win outcome facilitated by the African Union.@@@Africa is a continent of hope, with immense potential for prosperity.@@@The continent has already been implementing its transformative and ambitious Agenda 2063.@@@However, unleashing Africa’s potential requires mobilizing domestic and external financial resources.@@@The international financial architecture should be reformed, with special consideration for Africa’s needs and priorities.@@@A fast-track resolution of Africa’s debt 
crisis and the provision of additional development financing should be at the top of our agenda.@@@Ethiopia advocates for an inclusive international order that recognizes the contribution of all countries.@@@The very survival of humankind, the safety of our planet and the peace and security of the world are at stake.@@@Therefore, hope, justice and equality for all should indeed define the fundamental agenda of the Assembly.@@@Beyond the rhetoric, this organ has a responsibility to promote global consensus and translate ideas proposed in this very Hall into concrete actions.@@@As I conclude.@@@I would like to emphasize that we are at a critical juncture when humankind must come together with unity of purpose for peace and prosperity.@@@Fully aware that our time to serve is limited, each of us gathered here today should reflect on the legacy that we would like to leave behind for future generations.@@@I have the great honour to address the General Assembly on behalf of the Government and the people of the Republic of Vanuatu.@@@At the outset.@@@I would like to sincerely congratulate you.@@@Sir, on your well-deserved election as President of the Assembly at its seventy-eighth session, and to assure you of the full support and cooperation of the Vanuatu delegation during your term.@@@I commend your predecessor.@@@His Excellency Mr. Csaba Korosi, on the Assembly’s many remarkable achievements under his stewardship during challenging times.@@@I also congratulate Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on his determined and skilful leadership of the United Nations in promoting peace, security and development.@@@I would like to express Vanuatu’s sincere condolences to the Governments and the peoples of Morocco and Libya, who have been severely affected by the recent devastating earthquake and floods.@@@Vanuatu stands in solidarity with both countries during these difficult times.@@@We are meeting at a time of unprecedented global crisis and uncertainty.@@@We are failing to address the triple planetary crises of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution.@@@We are hurtling from one emergency to the next, unable to address the global shocks resulting from new technologies, pandemics, rapidly changing economies and accelerating poverty and inequality.@@@We are putting the existence of future generations at risk.@@@The world is at a historic crossroads.@@@Geopolitical tensions are exacerbating the global challenges of our time.@@@We are confronted by multi-polarization and the conflicting interests of major Powers.@@@The lack of trust among the major Powers is weakening the foundations of multilateralism.@@@Those challenges are global in nature and their resolution therefore requires deepened international cooperation.@@@It is essential that we respect and adhere to the international rule of law, and that includes the Charter of the United Nations.@@@We need a renewed commitment to multilateralism, with the United Nations at its core.@@@We welcome the Secretary-General’s New Agenda for Peace, an initiative that we see as a transformative tool for effective multilateralism.@@@Vanuatu also welcomes the theme of the seventy-eighth session.@@@“Rebuilding trust and reigniting global solidarity: Accelerating action on the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals towards peace, prosperity, progress and the sustainability for all”, which is relevant to addressing the current global challenges and accelerating the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@Despite the changing international environment, the United Nations has shown that it can be strong when the will of its members is harnessed for positive collective action.@@@We have seen the recent successful international legally binding instrument agreed on under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the conservation and sustainable use of the marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction, a breakthrough in establishing a loss and damage fund at the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and the adoption of resolution 77/276, initiated by Vanuatu through the Pacific Islands Forum for an International Court of Justice advisory opinion on climate change.@@@All of those efforts are a notable testament to effective multilateralism.@@@The guiding principles of these extraordinary institutions are the promotion of international peace and security, development and human rights and the eradication of poverty.@@@The most recent in a chain of events challenging those principles is the Ukraine conflict.@@@The danger of escalation of the war in Ukraine further justifies Vanuatu’s resolute calls for a nuclear- free world and a universal Arms Trade Treaty, which are necessary measures to prevent global human disasters.@@@In that regard, we must find the means to quickly reach consensus on nuclear non-proliferation.@@@We can find comfort in initiatives such as the Secretary-General’s New Agenda for Peace, a tool that offers us a unifying vision anchored in trust, universality and solidarity.@@@It can help us to address all forms and domains of threat — from prevention, peacemaking and peacekeeping to peace-building and sustainable development.@@@I remain firmly convinced that the challenges that have come so sharply into focus in recent years and months emphasize the call by Vanuatu and many other Member States for the reform of the Security Council and other United Nations agencies.@@@This reform is overdue and is critical to reflect today’s global realities.@@@We are halfway through the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@With 
a worrisome lack of progress, decades of development gains have been undermined and, in some cases, reversed by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), climate change and rising inflation, threatening the success of the 2030 Agenda.@@@In its accelerated development path.@@@Vanuatu leads a holistic and transformative approach, focusing on economic, social and environmental development, national well-being indicators, as well as building a peaceful society based on democratic institutions and human rights.@@@Putting the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) agenda into action is not merely a Government priority, it is an inclusive national undertaking across all State institutions, as well as civil society.@@@In the lead-up to the 2030 deadline, the Vanuatu Government convened a six-day national summit of the people, from 25 to 30 July, where all stakeholders, including those from academia and the corporate sphere, youth leaders and civil society representatives, across Vanuatu revisited and committed their efforts to implementing The People’s Plan 2030.@@@Vanuatu’s development road map.@@@As we renew efforts to double down on our commitments to the 2030 Agenda, we must acknowledge that climate change is the defining existential challenge of our time and has proven to set back decades of development progress.@@@While our countries are the smallest contributors to global climate change, we find ourselves on the front lines of the crisis.@@@In March, tropical Cyclone Judy hit the archipelago of Vanuatu, followed by tropical Cyclone Kevin just two days later.@@@The twin cyclones affected about 60 per cent of the total population.@@@Assessments estimated the total effects amounted to around 43 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP) and the total recovery needs were estimated to be around 77 per cent of GDP.@@@Leading into the twenty-eighth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, we once again emphasize the absolute imperative of limiting global warning to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.@@@Global efforts in that regard remain woefully inadequate, as reflected in the recent Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.@@@The report confirms that we are dangerously close to overshooting the 1.5°C limitation goal.@@@Drastic actions are required in this critical decade for course correction.@@@We need to not only fulfil the commitments that we have already made but also increase ambition to close the mitigation gap in line with the available science.@@@Not addressing it is a death sentence to small States such as Vanuatu.@@@Given the existential threat imposed by climate change.@@@Vanuatu, together with a core group of 18 countries, submitted to the General Assembly a draft resolution seeking an advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on climate change, which was adopted by consensus on 29 March (resolution 77/276).@@@Today States and intergovernmental organizations, such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources and the European Union, have received permission from the International Court of Justice to provide submissions to the Court.@@@This is a unique opportunity in our history, and I encourage Member States to prepare and present their submissions and make representations at the Court.@@@While Vanuatu acknowledges the critical role of the Paris Agreement to affect climate change.@@@Vanuatu believes that the Agreement does not go far enough to address the current increase in fossil fuel production.@@@As a consequence, in May.@@@Vanuatu hosted, the fifth Pacific Regional Energy and Transport Ministers’ Meeting, which culminated in the Port Vila call to action, which is aimed at a just and equitable transition towards a fossil fuel-free Pacific.@@@Together with Tuvalu, we are leading a call for the establishment of a global alliance to negotiate a non-proliferation treaty to facilitate ending fossil fuel expansion, an equitable phaseout of fossil fuels and a global just transition to renewable energy.@@@Reliable data has indicated that the Pacific small island developing States have received only 0.22 per cent of the global climate funds.@@@That is quite remarkable, given that we face the gravest threat from the impacts of climate change.@@@There remains a significant gap in the provision of sufficient predictable financing for implementing climate change adaptation and mitigation.@@@With the support of development partners, we are doing our part to start the construction of climate-resilient infrastructure and projects promoting sustainable resource management to assist mitigation and adaptation work.@@@However, more support and investments are required.@@@I wish to reiterate that climate finance must be separate and scale up and be in addition to development finance.@@@Both are critical to meet the development challenges we face.@@@The promised $100 billion in climate financing must also be fully delivered, providing climate vulnerable countries, such as Vanuatu, much-needed funds for adaptation and mitigation.@@@As we approach the midpoint of the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals and the global stocktake of the Paris Agreement, the progress recorded so far is very worrisome We therefore cannot overemphasize the urgency of accelerating the implementation of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 as an integral part of the 2030 Agenda.@@@We acknowledge and applaud the Secretary- General’s call to protect everyone on Earth through universal coverage of early warning systems.@@@We are delighted to see that some Pacific Island countries are included in the Secretary-General’s projects on early warning systems.@@@Vanuatu has undertaken the following measures, among other measures, to strengthen disaster risk management in the context of the climate change discourse: first, the new Disaster Risk Management Act, a tool that is built around preparing for and responding to disasters at the national, provincial and local levels, and secondly, a national land subdivision policy that takes a more comprehensive approach to risk reduction and climate adaptation for land development across Vanuatu.@@@Vanuatu’s experience with cascading natural disasters has prompted the need to incorporate disaster risk reduction in development planning to ensure that its national development framework is risk-informed.@@@We have come to realize that disaster risk reduction must be mainstreamed into the SDGs to ensure effective implementation and resilience.@@@COVID-19 has exerted considerable fiscal pressures on our country’s economy.@@@The tourism industry was hard hit, losing approximately 9.1 per cent of revenues.@@@Significant GDP contractions led to large fiscal deficits, leading us to maintain temporary fiscal measures, such as tax cuts and other spending, supporting the response to the pandemic.@@@Those temporary support measures come at the expense of building fiscal buffers to withstand fiscal shocks.@@@We need to strengthen regional and international cooperation, global solidarity, coordination and governance at the highest levels through a multi-sectoral approach to development and prepare for and respond to pandemics and other health emergencies in the future, in particular in developing countries.@@@Besides the inherent natural disasters that affect Vanuatu each year, the interlinked global crises are also placing immense pressure on the local economy.@@@Bilateral and domestic resource mobilization alone cannot compensate for the impact of the global crisis.@@@We face an enormous financing gap in solving the climate emergency while ensuring poverty reduction and sustainable development.@@@Therefore, to close the SDG financing gap, all financial sources must contribute towards a significant, rapid and exponential scaling up of investments towards the SDGs.@@@The reform of the international financial architecture to respond to the global challenges is therefore crucial.@@@Access to grant-based financing for transformational adaptation development is an ongoing challenge that is exacerbated by restrictive eligibility criteria for accessing development funding.@@@In that regard we see the proposed multidimensional vulnerability index as a welcome development and look forward to its adoption by the General Assembly later in the year.@@@As with many developing countries, debt sustainability remains a priority issue for us.@@@Debt relief or restructuring will create the necessary fiscal space to enable us to grow and focus on other priority needs.@@@We also need support from donor partners in accessing technical assistance and building capacity in order to enable better debt management and greater debt transparency.@@@In that regard, we welcome the formation of the International Monetary Fund-World Bank Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable as a framework for discussing options for debt resolution.@@@While we acknowledge the invaluable contributions of our major partners to our development aspirations, reliable data has shown that aid to the Pacific small island developing countries has been declining in recent years.@@@That has had several negative consequences for our States.@@@For Vanuatu, it has made it more difficult to invest in essential infrastructure, such as roads, schools and hospitals.@@@It has also made it more difficult to address pressing challenges such as climate change, disaster risk reduction and social protection and economic diversification.@@@South-South cooperation, which is complementary to North-South cooperation, is critically important to Vanuatu, just as North-South cooperation and strengthening and expanding South-@@@South cooperation in future will be crucial to Vanuatu’s 
efforts to achieve the goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@Vanuatu graduated from least developed country (LDC) status in 2020.@@@Our Government is working actively to implement a smooth transition strategy, with support from our development partners, in order to minimize any negative impacts of graduation.@@@The focus of our transition extends from simply mitigating the loss of existing LDC support measures to negotiating new ways of thinking about how we move forward and of working with trade and development partners to achieve our national development aspirations.@@@As we look ahead to the future we want, we must picture a world of freedom, one that is free from colonial rule, persecution and human rights abuses.@@@Seventeen non-self-governing territories still remain under the purview of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee today, and accelerating the decolonization agenda is critical.@@@It is a process that must be guided by the aspirations and needs of the territories on a case-by- case basis, and constructive dialogue is essential.@@@The consent of the territories is valid, and we must ensure that there is space at the United Nations for their voices to be heard.@@@I would like to emphasize that the imposition of coercive economic measures, including unilateral sanctions, on developing countries constitutes a major impediment to their economic and social development and seriously hinders dialogue and understanding among countries.@@@Such actions not only undermine the principles enshrined in the Charter and international law but are also a severe threat to freedom of trade and investment, and in that context we continue to call for the lifting of the economic embargo on Cuba.@@@Today we are facing unprecedented and interlocking crises.@@@The multilateral system is under greater strain than at any time since the creation of the United Nations.@@@We urgently need effective multilateral responses to prevent and resolve conflicts, manage economic uncertainty and rescue the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@Amid the recent challenges confronting the Charter, it remains our compass.@@@Let us work together for a better world.@@@This session of the General Assembly is being held under new and extremely complex geopolitical, economic and climatic conditions and challenges, which requires us all to find innovative solutions, change our traditional way of addressing those challenges and, first and foremost, end the long-standing suffering of our Yemeni people.@@@The theme of this debate seems to have been carefully designed to meet the demands of our people and Governments, rebuild confidence in our national and international institutions, and promote global solidarity in support of the Sustainable Development Goals towards peace, prosperity and progress for all.@@@My brother members of the Presidential Leadership Council, the Government and the Yemeni people commend the solidarity and unified position of the international community in support of constitutional legitimacy.@@@Yemen’s sovereignty and independence, its territorial integrity, and non-interference in its internal affairs.@@@We also appreciate the unified political position of the international community on the Yemeni issue and thank our brethren in the Coalition to Support Legitimacy in Yemen, led by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, for their solidarity with our people.@@@Their positions represented a strong bulwark against the collapse of Yemeni State institutions and strengthened our resolve in the face of the Houthi militias, supported by the guardianship of the Islamic jurist regime in Iran and the terrorist organizations allied with it.@@@Last year, my country witnessed a historic transformation, whereby the institutions of Yemeni legitimacy were rebuilt and the Presidential Leadership Council was created on the basis of strengthened partnership, peace-building and ending the war.@@@However, despite that important national transformation and the regional and international momentum to revive the political process, peace remained elusive, notwithstanding the concessions and initiatives made by the Yemeni Government in support of that path.@@@With the resumption of the laudable efforts of our brothers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Sultanate of Oman, as well as those of the United Nations and United States envoys, our hopes have been revived that the Houthi militias will submit to the popular, regional and international will and recognize the fact that the State’s role as guarantor of rights, freedoms and the enforcement of the rule of law on the basis of justice and equal citizenship is the only way to make our country safer, more stable and more respected in its regional and international surroundings.@@@That is the logic of the legitimate Government and the ultimate goal of any efforts for sustainable peace, which require broad partnership without discrimination or exclusion, and the foundation for a brighter future.@@@Today I do not believe that the Government has any further time or concessions to offer to convince the Houthi militias to change their position.@@@We can predict their intentions for decades to come.@@@If we do make any such compromises, that approach will return our people to the era of slavery, frustration and oblivion.@@@Our country could even become a hotspot for exporting terrorism, which would trigger a regional and international conflict that cannot be contained through diplomatic means.@@@Therefore, any complacency on the part of the international community or neglect of the legal status of the State, or even dealing with the militias as a de facto authority, would make it impossible to eliminate the practice of repression and the violation of public freedoms.@@@Based on our understanding of the approach of the Houthi militias, peace offers are nothing to them but test balloons to be dealt with from a tactical perspective to control more resources and postpone decisions on military confrontation until better conditions are achieved.@@@That is why they repudiated all previous agreements, including the latest which is the Stockholm Agreement.@@@Therefore, we stress the need to provide adequate guarantees for peace, which must be based on the three agreed nationally, regionally and internationally terms of reference.@@@We must respect international legitimacy, pursuant to the Saudi initiative.@@@In addition, sustainable peace must be based on justice and fairness and address the effects of the past and the main outstanding issues of the national dimension.@@@Furthermore, any peace initiative or confidence-building measure must be able to achieve tangible and immediate results in order to alleviate the suffering of the Yemeni people and benefit the victims of the conflict, not the leadership of armed militias.@@@Women and children must be the first beneficiaries.@@@Moreover, sustaining peace and ending the war is the basis of the desired peace that will guarantee the Yemenis their ability to build a State of institutions that protects the rights, freedoms and equality among its citizens and establish good-neighbourly relations and common interests with our brothers in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.@@@Today I believe that there is a more secure path to achieve peace and embody the theme of this session by restoring Yemenis’ confidence in international legitimacy and their national Government.@@@That will require us to support the legitimate Government and enhance its ability to build the economy and provide services, thus helping us to address the militias’ blackmail, which is obstructing the implementation of international resolutions, and reviving hope for the better and bright tomorrow promoted by United Nations envoys and mediators everywhere.@@@I also believe that the mission of our international system is to protect stability and global peace and to support the will of the peoples and their recognized national Governments.@@@That can easily be achieved today, given the ease of obtaining information and determining the facts.@@@However, prioritizing interests over the will of the people would weaken confidence in this institution and the entire international community.@@@I say that not to shirk our national responsibilities or make the international community a scapegoat for our failures, but because we believe that the major Powers must send a forceful message to the militias and the architects of coups against constitutional legitimacy, not only in Yemen but throughout the world, so as to clear the path towards peace and dispel the dreams of armed groups and those who aspire to power and their delusions of creating entities to compete with legitimate Governments.@@@In order to restore trust and achieve progress on the Yemeni dossier, we must recognize that the track based on international humanitarian interventions should be reconsidered and addressed radically so as to align it with the principles of international law and efforts to combat the financing of terrorism, rebellion and armed groups.@@@We welcome the United Nations efforts to move from relief interventions in my country towards sustainable development.@@@That transformation must 
include pooling international pledges and funds through the Central Bank of Yemen so as to strengthen our national currency, curb inflation and ensure that those funds do not indirectly fall into the hand of armed militias.@@@We must acknowledge that this supporting path contradicts the international rhetoric calling for an improvement in the indicators of Yemen’s economy at a time when its international operations are channelled through institutions under the control of the Houthi militias, despite their arbitrary measures to violate the independence of the banking sector and the confidentiality of its dealings and to turn that sector into a money-laundering network, plundering private and public resources as well as citizen depositors.@@@Moving forward with that approach would leave the State institutions of Yemen, a United Nations Member State, weak, underfunded and lacking sufficient resources to address those cross-border challenges and the country’s growing humanitarian needs.@@@Furthermore, those policies threaten to fuel the war economy and allow the flow of funds and pledges through banking outlets that are not subject to accountability and effective oversight.@@@The humanitarian interventions of the Yemeni Government prove that its support for improving basic services will make the lives of Yemenis men and women better and strengthen the prospects for peace by mobilizing people around their interests in development and prosperity, and not the slogans of violence, death and hatred espoused by the Houthi militias.@@@As I said from this rostrum last year:
“Every year passes without the adoption of a robust position on the Yemeni dossier, while our losses pile up and the militias and terrorist groups become increasingly dangerous in their transnational threats and perpetrate stark violations of human rights that have been the subject of consensus within the Organization for more than 70 years now.”@@@(A/77/PV8, p.10)@@@Indeed, this year we are witnessing a rapid growth in threats from Al-Qaida and Da’esh, which are fuelled by the Houthi militias and the Iranian regime with money, weapons and intelligence support, and by sharing with them the same Takfiri thought.@@@When I spoke here a year ago from this rostrum, the State’s general budget was achieving the best indicators since the outbreak of the war.@@@We were able to launch promising programmes to improve services and create job opportunities, but the momentum was halted and remains paralysed by Houthi terrorist attacks on oil installations that have put the country on the brink of a comprehensive humanitarian crisis.@@@I take this opportunity to say that, without the generous support that the Government received from our brothers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia last month through a financial grant of $1.2 billion in support of the State’s general budget, the Government would have been unable to meet its basic obligations, including the payment of salaries.@@@In that context, we also note the humanitarian and development funding and pledges from our brothers in the United Arab Emirates, our friends in the United States of America, the European Union countries, the United Kingdom and the rest of the regional and international partners.@@@Despite all those humanitarian interventions.@@@I note that the Houthi militias have recently escalated their threats against shipping lines in the Red Sea, the Bab Al-Mandab and the Gulf of Aden, which they treat as military zones.@@@They have tested new weapons on Yemeni islands and targeted commercial ships and oil tankers.@@@In that way, the militias and the Iranian regime behind them continue to destabilize the security and stability of the region and undermine efforts to renew the truce and resume the political process.@@@Today.@@@21 September, they are showing off their military capabilities on the occasion of the Nakba, when they overturned the national consensus and the legitimate constitution.@@@Today we reiterate the importance of ensuring freedom of international navigation, combating extremism, terrorism and piracy, and supporting measures aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, most notably Iran’s nuclear programme, ballistic missiles and destructive role in the region.@@@We once again call on the international community to condemn Iran’s blatant interference in the affairs of our country and its efforts to make it a platform for cross-border threats and to subject it to sanctions approved in accordance with the resolutions of international legitimacy related to the Yemeni dossier.@@@In that context, we call on Member States to commit to the arms embargo and face up to Iran’s destabilizing influence while preventing it from supplying its militias with military technologies such as ballistic missiles and drones, which are used to commit terrorist acts against innocent civilians.@@@The Presidential Leadership Council and the Government stress their firm commitment to all international conventions and treaties, including those protecting children and preventing their involvement in armed conflict.@@@They are also committed to providing the necessary guarantees for the work of international organizations and facilitating access of their aid to all those in need throughout Yemen.@@@To strengthen those efforts, the Government is working to enable the Independent National Commission to investigate allegations of human rights violations and the relevant international and United Nations mechanisms to fulfil their tasks unconditionally.@@@I note that all the understandings reached by the United Nations agencies with the Houthi militias have not been implemented so far, as those militias continue to recruit children and mobilize them in combat camps under the very eyes of the international community.@@@The Houthi militias commit gross violations of human rights every day, including by restricting travel, work, women’s education and suppressing journalists.@@@The Republic of Yemen stresses its firm position towards the Palestinian question.@@@We will continue to support the path towards peace and a comprehensive and just solution to the Palestinian question on the basis of the resolutions of international legitimacy and the Arab Peace Initiative, in a way that guarantees the right of the Palestinian people to establish their independent State.@@@We also affirm our support for all endeavours aimed at bringing peace to the Sudan, first and foremost the efforts of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the Arab Republic of Egypt and the United States to restore security, stability and development to that dear country.@@@I also cannot fail to offer my full solidarity and sincere condolences to my brothers in Libya and the Kingdom of Morocco because of the devastating hurricanes and earthquakes that struck those two brotherly countries.@@@We reiterate our appreciation and thanks to all our brothers who have supported those two countries, especially the sisterly Arab Republic of Egypt, as the dangers of climate change are increasingly threatening our global system.@@@I have the privilege and signal honour, on behalf of Mr. Patrice Talon.@@@President of the Republic of Benin, who is unable to be here today, to deliver this statement, as follows.@@@“At the beginning of my remarks.@@@I would like to extend to Mr. Dennis Francis my warm congratulations on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session.@@@I wish him every success in fulfilling this great responsibility.@@@I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate his predecessor.@@@Mr. Csaba Korosi, whom Benin is honoured to have supported in its capacity as Vice-President, for the remarkable way in which he presided over the work of the seventy-seventh session.@@@“I cannot conclude my opening remarks without reiterating my thanks to Mr. Antonio Guterres.@@@Secretary-General of the United Nations, for his active and constant commitment to the effective achievement of the noble objectives of our shared Organization, in the context of the many pressing challenges that confront us today more than ever.@@@“Here we are once again, gathered at the general debate, the annual meeting of the community of nations, not only to discuss the burning issues of world affairs but also, and above all, to provide the political guidelines needed to build a viable consensus on the ways and means of resolving them.@@@“Before engaging in that exercise.@@@I would like to extend to the Assembly the warmest greetings of my Government and of the entire Beninese nation, a nation that is tirelessly striving to reveal to itself and to the whole world its potential and its strengths and to fully play its part in the community of nations in the service of a more united and prosperous humankind.@@@“Indeed, for just over seven years.@@@Benin has been methodically carrying out the major reforms set out in my Government’s two successive plans of action, which are anchored in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).@@@Our efforts have enabled us to increase our growth rate from 4 per cent in 2016 to 7.6 per cent in 2019 and to join the category of middle-income countries as of 2020.@@@These results deepen our conviction that underdevelopment is not inevitable.@@@“In order to ensure that economic growth effectively serves the cause of social development, my Government has adopted a series of measures aimed at eliminating poverty and strengthening human capital.@@@We are working tirelessly to improve our people’s living conditions through flagship initiatives in urban development and sanitation, access to energy and drinking water and education and health care.@@@That effort is taking place in a calmer political environment, with the successful organization in January of this year of free and transparent legislative elections that bolstered plurality in the national political landscape.@@@“Despite those many achievements, we remain aware that many economic challenges persist, many social issues remain unaddressed and security risks persist at the subregional level.@@@“Located in West Africa.@@@Benin faces a series of challenges and complex dynamics that have a significant effect on a variety of areas, including security and political stability.@@@It is no secret that, at the political level, the West African subregion is grappling with instability and problems of governance.@@@Furthermore, the security threat 
has intensified in several countries due to the combination of terrorism, violent extremism and piracy.@@@Solving those challenges will require subregional and international cooperation, as well as a continued commitment to sustainable development and democracy.@@@As a peace-loving country.@@@Benin remains committed to the ideals that governed the establishment of the Economic Community of West African States at the subregional level and of the United Nations at the international level, and will not fail to contribute to the resolution of the problems I mentioned, which will require coordinated international responses and stronger cooperation at the global level.@@@“The theme that brings us together this year is “Rebuilding trust and reigniting global solidarity: accelerating action on the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals towards peace, prosperity, progress and the sustainability for all”, which fits perfectly with the agenda of the United Nations, which conducted an assessment of progress towards the implementation of the 2030 Agenda at the SDG summit held a few days ago.@@@In the current global context, replete with various crises, in particular the worrisome effects of climate change, the war in Ukraine and its consequences and the political unrest in a number of countries, we are approaching the current session even as humankind continues to face a multitude of complex challenges.@@@“The past few years have been particularly challenging for people around the world, highlighting the fragilities of our world in the context of globalization, the coronavirus disease pandemic and its consequences.@@@In our world, which has been shaken, divided by inequalities and weakened in the face of new threats, the United Nations must remain for the people of the planet a beacon of hope, solidarity and humanism that we must strengthen and preserve at all costs.@@@The theme of the current session of the General Assembly brings us face to face with our responsibilities and urges us to renew our faith in the ideals of the Charter of the United Nations.@@@It reminds us of the urgency of taking collective action to find appropriate and sustainable solutions to the challenges of our time, the most pressing of which is that of achieving the SDGs by 2030.@@@Those challenges underline, more than ever, the crucial role that multilateral institutions must play for our prosperity and our collective security.@@@Benin therefore supports all initiatives that will contribute to the strengthening and ambitious overhaul of global governance, through appropriate reforms along three major lines.@@@“The overhaul of the United Nations that we are calling for requires us to take full measure of the fact that the world has changed greatly since 1945 and that, if we want to keep the promises of the Charter, the governance of the United Nations must be reformed with a view to adapting the Organization to the challenges of our time.@@@At this time.@@@I wish to renew my delegation’s political support for the reform agenda proposed and launched by the Secretary-General with respect to the three pillars of peace and security, development and human rights.@@@Furthermore, the severity of the crises shaking the world and the geopolitical changes that have occurred since 1945 require a readjustment of the balance of power at the United Nations, particularly in the Security Council.@@@In that regard.@@@Benin calls for an effective and immediate reform that will make that organ more representative and effective, in particular through an increase in the number of its representatives, permanent and non-permanent, in line with the African position expressed by the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration.@@@That overhaul must also take place at the level of the multilateral trading system, with fairer trade rules for the international environment that favour developing countries and promote the production and creation of added value, access to markets and integration into all segments of the global value chains.@@@“Finally, there is an urgent need for an overhaul of the global financial architecture in the current context that some describe as a “great financial divide”, in which the global financial system struggles to effectively curb the impacts of global crises on the countries of the South and to promote the financing of sustainable development in a meaningful way.@@@At the halfway mark to the deadline of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, if we want to increase our chances of achieving the goals we have set for ourselves, it will be imperative to ensure an environment that allows better access to structuring and sustainable financing.@@@That imperative calls for an approach that goes beyond the traditional official 
development assistance mechanism and towards productive direct investments, at the lowest interest rates and with the longest possible timelines.@@@“It is only subject to such courageous reforms, supported by firm political will, that we can effectively face the major contemporary challenges confronting us and on which our Organization stakes its credibility at both the national and the international levels.@@@Those challenges are, inter alia, peace and security, including cybersecurity; democracy and human rights; access to water and energy in a sustainable and environmentally friendly manner; health and education; the fight against poverty and inequalities, whether economic, social or otherwise; climate change, biodiversity and the environment; food safety; and migration.@@@Those challenges are interconnected, and international cooperation, concerted action and innovative solutions will be required to solve contemporary global problems and build a more sustainable and equitable future for all.@@@“The credibility of our Organization will also depend on our ability to finally provide, in a fair and lasting manner, peaceful solutions to questions that have persisted for decades, including the following questions.@@@With regard to peace and security in the Middle East, in particular the Palestinian question.@@@Benin reaffirms its support for diplomatic initiatives aimed at creating a viable Palestinian State endowed with the attributes of full international sovereignty and living in peaceful coexistence with the State of Israel.@@@With regard to the economic, commercial and financial blockade imposed on Cuba by the United States of America, my delegation is of the opinion that the relaxation, or even the lifting, of the embargo will allow the Cuban people to face the numerous crises currently disrupting our world; in that context, we call for concrete measures to be taken towards the complete and definitive lifting of the blockade, as well as the normalization of relations between those two countries, which are friends of Benin.@@@With regard to the question of the Western Sahara, it merits increased efforts on the part of the international community to find a definitive solution, building on the achievements of the political process conducted under the auspices of the Secretary- General pursuant to the implementation of the relevant Security Council resolutions.@@@“The future of the United Nations, our shared Organization, depends on our collective responsibility to give it the means to strengthen itself and contribute to creating a more inclusive global governance system that keeps its promises and guarantees the best possible future for the people of the United Nations, especially young people.@@@My delegation will continue to take action alongside all countries that share that ideal.”@@@We are meeting in this Hall today at a time that is undeniably one of the most challenging in recent history.@@@One look at the news, and we see the highest number of violent conflicts since the Second World War, including a full-scale war of aggression by Russia against Ukraine, an intensifying global climate crisis with extreme weather events causing devastation around the world, rising poverty, social divisions and a backsliding of human rights and development gains that were hard-earned over the past decades.@@@The world seems to be in a sad state of affairs, and one wonders whether the worst is yet to come.@@@We are indeed living in a time of uncertainty — in a time between times, so to speak.@@@The old order is fading and a new one is yet to emerge.@@@Sometimes I compare our current situation to an earthquake: the entire Earth is still shaking, the tectonic plates are still moving, and we do not know yet where they will come to rest.@@@But we instinctively feel that the fault lines will be deeper and wider in the end.@@@We are already seeing shifts and cracks in our trade systems, security systems and multilateral systems — no wonder that has led to a sense of insecurity and unease and to the feeling of living in a permanent state of emergency.@@@In this era of transformation, our citizens are rightly expecting answers.@@@I deeply believe that, as politicians, it is our responsibility to formulate hopeful yet realistic visions.@@@That means we must look at the world as it is, lucid and clear-headed, without rose-tinted glasses.@@@It also means that we have to be on our guard against those polarizing populists who spread fake news and offer seemingly easy answers to complex questions, who want us to believe that we can solve problems by simply negating them, by pulling up the drawbridge and decoupling from reality, be it on climate change, disruptive technologies like artificial intelligence, mutual political and economic dependencies or the growing multipolarity in geopolitics.@@@We cannot close our eyes to the complex realities of our modern world.@@@There are simply no silver bullets or quick fixes.@@@That would be another and very dangerous form of wishful thinking.@@@After all, we should know — and especially.@@@I would claim, in Europe — that wishful thinking is never a solid basis for policy.@@@That was painfully proven to us on 24 February 2022, when Russia brutally invaded Ukraine.@@@For a country like Austria — militarily neutral, export-oriented and at the heart of the European continent — the answer clearly lies in cooperation.@@@We understand that, in order to deliver for our own citizens — to make their lives more secure, create economic opportunities and tackle global challenges — we need to work in partnership with others.@@@That is why we are so deeply invested in multilateralism.@@@It is part of Austria’s ONA, in fact — not least because Vienna is the proud home of one of the United Nations headquarters and over 50 international organizations.@@@We know that the rules-based international order is our only protective shield against a world where might makes right and where unilateralism and the use of force rule.@@@Frankly.@@@I believe that no one in this Hall can deny that the rules-based international order — with all its imperfections.@@@I agree — has served us all pretty well over the past eight decades: through a free and open global economy; through preventive diplomacy and peacekeeping, which have brought stability to our neighbourhoods, an effort which Austrian Blue Helmets have been supporting since 1960; through a web of international treaties and agreements addressing such diverse issues as disarmament and climate change; and through a system of human rights established 75 years ago in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and confirmed 30 years ago in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action.@@@However, we must ask ourselves honestly: is the multilateral system still fit for purpose?@@@Can it last for another 80 years?@@@The answer is simple and sobering: 
no, it cannot, and it will not.@@@We need to reform it in order to preserve it.@@@Because what we are seeing, and what I am hearing loudly in this very Hall, is that the rules-based international order is not inclusive enough.@@@The Security Council no longer reflects today’s world.@@@It needs to offer a seat to more of the countries left out at the time of its establishment, including from Africa.@@@I can assure members that Austria will continue to push for reform, including in our candidature for a non-permanent seat on the Council in 2026.@@@The multilateral system is not proactive or effective enough.@@@It has made little impact in places like Afghanistan, where women are systematically denied their most basic rights to education and to participate in public life, and in the Sahel region, where a series of coups d’etat serve only the generals, not the citizens.@@@It has not been able to stop Russia, one of the Council’s five permanent members, from invading its sovereign neighbour Ukraine in a fit of neo-imperialist aggression.@@@What I am talking about is enlightened self-interest.@@@I stand here today as a representative of a smaller country with a great history.@@@After the First World War, my country shrank from an empire with over 50 million inhabitants to a State of fewer than 10 million people today and a fraction of its former territory.@@@Yet where do we stand today in Austria?@@@Today Austria is a successful and flourishing country, with a high degree of social stability, economic prosperity and environmental protection.@@@It capital city.@@@Vienna, has been voted again and again as the world’s most liveable city.@@@I believe that there is a message there for those countries and leaders who want to turn back the clock and who abuse history as a pretext to justify their violence today.@@@They are on the wrong track.@@@We cannot build a future while being stuck in the past.@@@We Austrians have learned from our history.@@@It is precisely those experiences of the past that make us care so strongly about multilateralism.@@@There is simply no better alternative for safeguarding our prosperity and security and for tackling global challenges.@@@That is why we are deeply invested in our partnerships with our friends and neighbours in Europe and within the European Union, with organizations such as the United Nations and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, with our strategic partners around the globe and with engaged civil society organizations and the private sector.@@@We have also increased our outreach to the Asia-Pacific region, and we are engaging with African partners, very importantly, in the spirit of mutual respect and common interests.@@@In the beginning.@@@I said that we should look at the world as it is.@@@The bitter truth is that we are more divided than ever.@@@All too often, even in this Hall, we talk at, rather than with, each other.@@@We speak instead of listening.@@@Therefore, today I would like us all to remember why this Hall was built in the first place — as a space for real dialogue, not an echo chamber or a club for like-minded countries, a place where we advocate for our principles and values, without denying other points of view.@@@Yes, it is where we have heated debates and difficult negotiations, but in the end, it is where we can always reach a compromise.@@@Let me be very clear: I am not championing nihilism nor moral reductionism.@@@We know exactly where we stand.@@@Austria will always speak out for the values and principles that we hold dear, proudly and resolutely.@@@I am deeply convinced that our societies based on freedom, pluralism and individual rights are the best guarantee for our citizens’ security and prosperity.@@@At the same time.@@@I clearly reject the notion of being “either with us or against us”, the idea of cancelling entire societies and cultures and reverting to moralizing, finger-pointing or self-righteousness.@@@That is a lesson that we Europeans also have to learn, and quickly.@@@Let us not kid ourselves: the world is simply not black and white.@@@It is simply not that easy.@@@To me, that would not be responsible statecraft.@@@It might play well with the social media bubble, but it does not reflect reality.@@@It will only strengthen the fringes of our societies, not the centre.@@@That is why Austria will continue to be a champion of sensible and pragmatic multilateralism as we adapt, innovate and recalibrate our international cooperation.@@@All of that is difficult and requires endurance, strategic patience, a lot of explaining and a healthy dose of realism, but if we succeed, all of us will be better off.@@@We will emerge from this era of transformation stronger, more prosperous and more resilient.@@@I am very honoured to speak to the General Assembly on behalf of the Government of Canada.@@@I recognize that I am doing so on the traditional territory of the Lenape people.@@@I would first like to congratulate you.@@@Mr. President, on your election as President of the General Assembly.@@@If I may say so, it is wonderful to see a member of the community of Permanent Representatives to the United Nations taking charge.@@@It has been a pleasure working with you.@@@Sir, and I look forward to working together in the time ahead.@@@I would like to offer our sincere condolences to all those who have lost loved ones in the terrible floods in Libya, and to our dear friends in Morocco, who are mourning the many lives that were taken by the devastating earthquake.@@@Let me assure the Assembly that Canada stands ready to assist in whatever way we can in the face of those challenging situations.@@@We are also thinking today — as we see the very tragic photographs and videos — of the Armenians who are leaving Nagorno-Karabakh after such a challenging experience over the past several months and indeed years.@@@Just before I came to New York.@@@I had the opportunity to work with an indigenous council of leaders in Northern Ontario.@@@Canada.@@@They had what I thought was a very effective slogan, which was quite simple.@@@It talked about the power of unity and the dignity of difference.@@@I believe that is a theme we should perhaps think about.@@@Sometimes people talk about the failure of the United Nations, and I point out to them that, no, it is actually the divided nations that are failing.@@@When we are united, we succeed.@@@It is when we are divided that we fail.@@@I therefore suggest that we seize this time and all the times we have to make a difference.@@@But we will only succeed if we come together.@@@We are at the halfway point in trying to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, which we all agreed we would work on eight years ago.@@@We recently adopted the Agreement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas beyond National Jurisdiction.@@@We are also approaching the first global stocktaking of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.@@@However, in listening to the speeches over the past week, it has been very clear that there is a profound consensus that we are very far behind where we need to be to meet the commitments that we have all made to our populations and to one another.@@@The health of our planet, our people and our institutions, the well-being of all our populations and indeed our global economy are all at serious risk.@@@I met earlier last week with Wilton Littlechild, a former Grand Chief of the Confederacy of Treaty@@@Six First Nations and a member of Canada’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission, in addition to being a negotiator of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.@@@He talked to me very directly about how it is so critical that we not look at the issues in isolation.@@@As we speak here, we go from topic to topic and from things we have to cover to the next thing we have to cover.@@@But it is important we see them all as a whole.@@@We need to recognize how things are connected.@@@I can assure everyone that, like many people in the countries of our Organization.@@@Canadians, too, are worried about the cost of living.@@@They are also concerned about artificial intelligence, foreign interference, misinformation and disinformation.@@@As we all know full well—and as the citizens of New York know full well — Canadians are also experiencing climate and environmental crises.@@@This summer.@@@Canadians witnessed the most destructive forest fires in our country’s history.@@@We had never seen anything like that before this summer, and it demonstrated the extent to which we are all interconnected.@@@Those fires were on a never-before-seen scale.@@@They were burning at the same time, everywhere.@@@And that was not unique to Canada.@@@Fires raged on an unprecedented scale around the world.@@@That was not a glimpse into our future, but a testament to our present.@@@Our response to these challenges must not be complacency, division or nostalgia for the past.@@@This is not about pointing the finger or of looking for panaceas.@@@What is important is taking concrete measures to help address — both in Canada and around the world — the challenges we all face together.@@@We are taking steps at the national level, of course.@@@And it is entirely right and normal that all of us would be taking steps at home to deal with the crisis that we face.@@@For example, in Canada, we made a decision to admit more people into our country than ever before because we have found and discovered that immigration has made us a better country and it has made us a better place to live.@@@We have also decided to put a price on carbon because we know that we must do everything we can to curb climate change, even as we know that we have to do more ourselves.@@@We believe strongly that reducing emissions is a duty that is shared, but so is the need to ensure something else — the access to capital on longer terms and with more favourable rates in order to help in the green transformation of the global economy.@@@That is why we recently agreed to donate more of our special drawing rights at the International Monetary Fund, as the Prime Minister announced last week.@@@We made the decision to grant 48 per cent of our own drawing rights to other countries.@@@That is the highest number among those that have special drawing rights, and we encourage others to follow that example.@@@We also continue to search for ways to break down gender barriers and to end systemic racism — to not be afraid to describe it as such and to say it is something we have to continue to deal with.@@@We continue to strive to protect and promote the rights of two-spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex and asexual individuals and communities, in all their diversity.@@@And let me say from this platform why we do that and why I describe it in this way.@@@It is because it is so fundamental to human nature itself to let people be themselves, to let people be who they are and to have the right to celebrate their own identity, without repression, without division and without discrimination.@@@It is foundational for us.@@@And yes, so is walking the path towards reconciliation with Indigenous peoples because, with full humility and in recognition of our own faults, we have found strength in diversity, purpose in equity and unity in inclusion.@@@And like many others, we have found greater peace in finally admitting the truth of who we are.@@@Late last month, at the invitation of the Government of Panama.@@@I had the opportunity to visit the Darien Gap — the jungle that serves as the border between Colombia and Panama.@@@I saw the irregular migration crisis unfolding there, as we call it, where, in real terms, it is hundreds of thousands of men, women and especially children who are risking their lives to cross the Gap.@@@The sheer number of people who are crossing and on this journey is shocking, and it has to be seen in a much broader light.@@@I had the chance to speak with individuals from many different countries, of course from the region, but also from Afghanistan.@@@China and Syria.@@@And this regional crisis, which is now very much in the Americas, is part of a global crisis.@@@There are today more than 108 million people that are forcibly displaced around the world.@@@Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya remain displaced in Bangladesh and in their native Rakhine, as the military junta continues its brutal and illegal crackdown in Myanmar.@@@In Afghanistan, where the de facto authorities are repressing the rights of women and girls, more than 5 million people are displaced or refugees.@@@After more than 12 years of war, more than 12 million Syrians are internally displaced or refugees in neighbouring countries.@@@Two million have now been displaced by the conflict in the Sudan, including those already scarred by the genocidal violence in Darfur.@@@Conflicts are one of the main drivers of this global crisis, as are climate change, natural disasters and economic insecurity.@@@Those who are seeking to cross the Darien Gap are fleeing all of those factors for displacement.@@@The numerous people who are trying to 
cross the Gap showed me the consequences of our action or our inaction here, at the United Nations.@@@And my visit strengthened my deep conviction that what we say and what we do here at the United Nations is of crucial importance to the lives of the people we represent.@@@We must remember our collective power.@@@As I said earlier, power lies in unity, not in division.@@@We must also remember our responsibility to do as much good as possible for as many people as possible.@@@To be honest.@@@I was moved by the remarkable work done by the United Nations and all the humanitarian organizations that I visited.@@@We see around the world that humanitarian needs have reached historical levels.@@@However, funding is clearly insufficient.@@@We all know that the most sustainable solutions are political ones.@@@They must address the underlying causes of humanitarian crises, while finding lasting solutions that respect human dignity and human rights and that create sustainable frameworks for economic development and prosperity.@@@That is just as true in Afghanistan as it is in Myanmar.@@@Syria and the Sudan.@@@We are also at a crossroads, as the President of the General Assembly said in his opening address.@@@We are at a crossroads in history on two issues that are closely linked — gender equality and democracy.@@@I was in the Hall when the President of South Africa was speaking, and he eloquently reminded us in his speech that the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals depends on the empowerment of women in all spheres of life.@@@He called for the provision of adequate health services to every woman, child and adolescent — every kid—and made a passionate plea for the equal representation of women in decision-making.@@@President Ramaphosa is absolutely right.@@@Yet sometimes today we are told at the United Nations, when we are in our negotiations, that gender is too divisive an issue.@@@We are told that to seek ambition in this area is insensitive — I have heard those words myself— that it should be put aside for compromise.@@@Well.@@@I could not disagree more.@@@For us, gender equality is a not an issue to be bartered against perceptions of progress, nor is it just something nice to have or something that can be said but always has to be qualified.@@@Gender equality — the equality between men and women, the equality among all human beings — is core to our dignity.@@@It is the foundation of freedom; it is the foundation of justice; and it is the foundation of peace.@@@If we cannot treat ourselves as equals, we will never achieve the things we want to achieve.@@@It is also essential in our work on financing for development and in the reform of the global financial architecture.@@@And we are committed to responding to the calls of developing countries in those discussions.@@@As I mentioned before, it is not just what I say, it is what we do.@@@And what we have done, is to indicate and to take the decision that we are moving forward in respect to the special drawing rights, as we have been asked to do.@@@Sustainable economic growth cannot be realized if the opportunities for women, who represent half the population, are suppressed.@@@At the same time, as we put great emphasis on the importance of equality, we also have to uphold the values of free and democratic societies.@@@We cannot bend the rules of State-to-State relations for political expediency, because we have seen and continue to see the extent to which democracies are under threat through various means of foreign interference.@@@But the truth is, if we do not adhere to the rules that we have agreed to, the very fabric of our open and free societies may start to tear.@@@We also have to protect and promote the principles of equality and universality of access to health care for all, including sexual and reproductive health rights for all women.@@@By building open, inclusive societies and by promoting and protecting human rights for all, everyone benefits.@@@That is how we get closer to equality and to justice.@@@I turn now to the situation in Haiti.@@@We must also work together to address the urgent humanitarian, political and civil crisis in Haiti.@@@Last week.@@@Prime Minister Trudeau convened a meeting of the Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Haiti, which Canada is proud to chair.@@@We are grateful for the participation of leaders from Haiti, from Caribbean countries and from many others.@@@If I may say so.@@@I very much appreciated the statement delivered here earlier this morning by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Jamaica.@@@We have heard it loud and clear: the security situation in Haiti is dire.@@@Rape is being systematically used as a weapon, while violence, corruption and impunity are the norm.@@@We therefore unreservedly support the 
intensification of efforts deployed by the Security Council to address the situation as a priority.@@@The offer from Kenya to lead a security support assistance mission in Haiti is a testimony to its leadership and solidarity.@@@We also welcome the contributions pledged by Jamaica, the Bahamas and other countries.@@@We commend those countries and international organizations that have joined the international joint security coordination cell that was announced in June by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Canada.@@@Ms. Melanie Joly.@@@Canada has made significant investments in the Haitian security sector and will continue to do so.@@@We encourage others to join us in that effort.@@@At the same time, we reiterate our appeal for an inclusive political dialogue.@@@We once again encourage all stakeholders to work together in a spirit of compromise for the benefit of the Haitian people.@@@It is essential to re-establish constitutional order, pave the way for free and fair elections, and ultimately address the root causes of the violence.@@@But above all, a comprehensive approach that supports Haitian-led solutions and includes urgent measures in the fields of security, humanitarian assistance and development is absolutely essential.@@@Security for everyone living in Haiti is a precondition for all else that we must do.@@@But in doing so, we must reinforce that security by working on the humanitarian, development and political crises.@@@We have to show what we can do in that joined-up effort.@@@Over the past decades, the Middle East and the wider world have struggled with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.@@@It was an issue in 1945 and it remains an issue today.@@@Today Canadians are greatly concerned by the trajectory of the conflict, noting in particular the rising levels of violence in the West Bank and in Israel, the continued risk of escalation between Israel and Gaza and groups in Lebanon and the continued growth of Israeli settlements that do not have a foundation in international law.@@@The measures and rhetoric that make two States impossible has to stop.@@@We are committed to the goal of a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle East, which includes the creation of a Palestinian State living side by side in peace and security with Israel.@@@We urge both parties to return to the negotiating table and make the difficult compromises that will be required to achieve that result.@@@We firmly oppose the unilateral actions that jeopardize efforts for peace and the failure to embrace all that is entailed in creating two States that are not bickering or at war and fighting each other, or threatening each other, but live in peace, in mutual recognition and with that concept of the dignity of difference.@@@Unless we get there, we will have only deeper conflict.@@@That has to be avoided.@@@The path that we take together at this crossroads in history will determine the future of our Organization.@@@It will also have an impact on the lives of all of our citizens.@@@We have seen the power of the veto of the permanent members of the Security Council used to prevent the Council from reacting to atrocities and aggression.@@@We support voluntary restraint on the use of the veto by all permanent members in situations in which civilians are at risk of atrocity crimes.@@@We also support efforts that seek to increase the number of elected members of the Council in order to guarantee more equitable representation of a larger number of developing countries around the world.@@@We challenge all permanent members of the Council to accept, more fully and more publicly, the need to become more effective, more inclusive and more transparent.@@@Now is the time for reform.@@@That appeal does not stop at the Security Council.@@@All of our intergovernmental processes, within all organs of the United Nations, must become more efficient.@@@We must be open to making the necessary changes.@@@It is up to us to decide.@@@Yes, we are halfway to 2030 and yes, we are falling behind.@@@But we are also capable of rectifying the situation and forging ahead together.@@@Canada is convinced that we can indeed do so.@@@Multilateralism has always evolved — that has been the case in the past and it will be the case in the future — but we must act.@@@Our institutions, including the international financial architecture, do not need to be static.@@@We have worked closely with our colleagues from Jamaica and Barbados and with the Secretary-General because we all believe in the possibility of change and the need to undertake efforts towards significant progress.@@@We will continue to invest, as we have done in the past, because we believe in the United Nations.@@@We believe that the Organization can build lasting peace.@@@(spoke in English)@@@I have to conclude on a sombre note.@@@What remains the greatest threat to global peace and security today — and there is no getting around it, there is no avoiding it and not calling it what it is — is Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.@@@We wake up every morning, our time, to the news of which city has been bombed, which children have been maimed and which communities have been destroyed.@@@The Charter of the United Nations clearly commits us all to end the scourge of war.@@@Those are the first words of what we were determined to do.@@@The Russian Federation signed the Charter of the United Nations and yet, despite that signature, for 580 days the Russian Federation has waged an illegal and immoral war of aggression against a fellow Member of this Organization, namely.@@@Ukraine.@@@The Russians went to the International Court of Justice and said that it was not an invasion, it was self-defence.@@@They said that they were exercising their right under Article 51 of the Charter, and besides that, that it was a genocide caused by the Ukrainians.@@@The only problem with those arguments was that the Court looked at them and said that they were not true.@@@This is an invasion of one country by another.@@@It is the most fundamental breach of the Charter one could imagine.@@@The costs of the war are staggering.@@@First of all, there is the unimaginable cost in lives — thousands upon thousands — with hospitals and schools bombed, people displaced and children abducted and forcibly deported.@@@President Zelenskyy was right when he said that it was a global natural disaster.@@@It has caused volatility in food and energy prices at a time when the global economy was already struggling.@@@And what has been Russia’s response?@@@First, it has denied that it is happening and has called it a special military operation generated under Article 51.@@@Those are just lies.@@@They are not compatible with what we know and what we can see are the facts.@@@Russia has also blocked the Black Sea Grain Initiative.@@@It is holding the world’s food supply hostage.@@@It is causing the cost of living to go up in every country in the world.@@@It is putting millions of people out of work in countries all over the world.@@@It is turning countries against each other.@@@We have to realize that Russia does not have the best interests of any of us in mind.@@@And we simply cannot allow President Putin and his enablers to pretend that the Charter does not exist and make a mockery of our foundational law in the relationships between us.@@@The truth is that Russia has committed a terrible aggression and is committing a terrible aggression each and every day.@@@We received a report earlier this week saying that torture is being committed as a matter of State policy.@@@We believe that Russia has to be held accountable, and we are determined to see justice served.@@@Canada welcomes the International Criminal Court’s indictments of President Putin and his Commissioner for Children’s Rights because we believe that no one is above the law.@@@But what have the Russians done even this week?@@@This week they issued arrest warrants against three senior officials —judges of the International Criminal Court.@@@The President of the International Criminal Court, who speaks from this rostrum every year describing the work of the Court, is under an arrest warrant issued by the Russians.@@@Imagine what it would be like if we lived in a world where, in any of our countries, a criminal indicted for crimes could simply say.@@@“Well, fine.@@@I am just going to take out the chief justice”.@@@These are terrible things.@@@We will do everything we can to support Ukraine as it continues to defend itself and its people, identity, sovereignty and territorial integrity.@@@We believe that is fully in line with our commitments under the Charter and international law, and we also believe that it is the war that is not legal.@@@It is the war that is fundamentally immoral.@@@It is a war that Russia started, and Russia can end it.@@@Russia could end it right now by simply saying that it is over and pulling its troops back.@@@That would be the end of the war.@@@There would be no invasion of Russia.@@@It would be over.@@@Peace would come.@@@People say that they want peace.@@@Tell that to the Russians.@@@They are the ones who can create peace, with the snap of their fingers.@@@Let me go back to where I started just to say that we have to seize the chance we have to make a difference.@@@We must seize all the opportunities before us to make a difference.@@@We have to find within ourselves the ability to create unity where there is division.@@@We have to find inside ourselves the capacity to recognize the importance of accepting differences.@@@If we can do that, we can create a United Nations that will be worthy of the name.@@@That is our job and our obligation, and that is the work we have to do.@@@On behalf of the people of Nigeria.@@@I congratulate Mr. Dennis Francis on his well- deserved election as President of the General Assembly at this session.@@@We commend his predecessor.@@@Mr. Csaba Korosi, for his able stewardship of the Assembly.@@@We also commend Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for his work seeking to forge solutions to humankind’s common challenges.@@@This is my first address before the General Assembly.@@@Permit me to say a few words on behalf of Nigeria, my country, and on behalf of Africa, my continent, regarding this year’s theme.@@@Many proclamations have been made, yet our troubles remain close at hand.@@@Failures in good governance have hindered Africa, but broken promises, unfair treatment and outright exploitation from abroad have also exacted a heavy toll on our ability to progress.@@@Given that long history, if this year’s theme is to mean anything at all, it must mean something special and particular to Africa.@@@In the aftermath of the Second World War, nations gathered in an attempt to rebuild their war-torn societies.@@@A new global system was born and this great body, the United Nations, was established as a symbol and protector of the aspirations and finest ideals of humankind.@@@Nations saw that it was in their own interests to help others exit the rubble and wasteland of war.@@@Reliable and significant assistance allowed countries emaciated by war to grow into strong and productive societies.@@@The period was a high-water mark for trust in global institutions and the belief that humankind had learned the necessary lessons to move forward in global solidarity and harmony.@@@Today and for several decades.@@@Africa has been asking for the same level of political commitment and devotion of resource that described the Marshall Plan.@@@We realize that the underlying conditions and causes of the economic challenges facing today’s Africa are significantly different from those of post-war Europe.@@@We are not asking for identical programmes and actions.@@@What we seek is an equally firm commitment to partnership.@@@We seek enhanced international cooperation with African nations to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@There are five important points I want to highlight.@@@First, if this year’s theme is to have any impact at all, global institutions, other nations and their private-sector actors must see African development as a priority, not just for Africa but in their own interests as well.@@@Due to long-standing internal and external factors.@@@Nigeria’s and Africa’s economic structures have been skewed to impede development, industrial expansion, job creation and the equitable distribution of wealth.@@@If Nigeria is to fulfil its duty to its people and the rest of Africa, we must create jobs and inspire the belief in a better future for our people.@@@We are pushing for that.@@@We must also lead by example, and we are doing so.@@@To foster economic growth and investor confidence in Nigeria.@@@I removed the costly and corrupt fuel subsidy, while also discarding a noxious exchange rate system in my first few days in office.@@@Other growth and job-oriented reforms are in the wings.@@@I am mindful of the transient hardship that reform can cause.@@@However, it is necessary to go through that phase in order to establish a foundation for durable growth and investment to build the economy our people deserve.@@@We welcome partnerships with those who do not mind seeing Nigeria and Africa assume larger roles in the global community.@@@The question is not whether Nigeria is open for business.@@@The question is how much of the world is truly open to doing business with Nigeria and Africa in an equal, mutually beneficial manner.@@@Direct investment in critical industries, opening their ports to a wider range and larger quantity of African exports, and meaningful debt relief are important aspects of the cooperation we seek.@@@Secondly, we must affirm democratic governance as the best guarantor of the sovereign will and wellbeing of the people.@@@Military coups are wrong, as is any tilted civilian political arrangement that perpetuates injustice.@@@The wave crossing parts of Africa does not demonstrate favour towards coups.@@@It is a demand for solutions to perennial problems.@@@Let us dig deeper into the problem.@@@Regarding the Niger, we are negotiating with the military leaders.@@@As Chairman of the Economic Community of West African State.@@@I seek to help re-establish democratic governance in a manner that addresses the political and economic challenges confronting that nation, including the violent extremists who seek to foment instability in our region.@@@I extend a hand of friendship to all who genuinely support the mission to achieve democratic governance in that nation.@@@That brings me to my third crucial point.@@@Our entire region is locked in protracted battle against violent extremists.@@@In the turmoil, a dark channel of inhumane commerce has formed.@@@Along the route, everything is for sale.@@@Men, woman and children are seen as chattel.@@@Yet, thousands risk the Sahara’s hot sand and the Mediterranean’s cold depths in search of a better life.@@@At the same time, mercenaries and extremists, with their lethal weapons and vile ideologies, invade our region from the north.@@@That harmful traffic undermines the peace and stability of an entire region.@@@African nations will improve our economies so that our people do not risk their lives to sweep the floors and streets of other nations.@@@We shall also devote ourselves to disbanding extremist groups on our turf.@@@Yet, to fully corral that threat, the international community must strengthen its commitment to arresting the flow of arms and violent people into West Africa.@@@The fourth important aspect of global trust and solidarity is to secure the continent’s mineral rich areas from pilfering and conflict.@@@Many such areas have become catacombs of misery and exploitation.@@@The Democratic Republic of the Congo has suffered this for decades, despite the strong United Nations presence there.@@@What happened?@@@The world economy owes the Democratic Republic of the Congo much but gives it very little.@@@The mayhem visited on resource-rich areas does not respect national boundaries.@@@The Sudan.@@@Mali.@@@Burkina Faso, the Central African Republic — the list grows on and on and on.@@@The problems is also knocking at Nigeria’s door.@@@Foreign entities, abetted by local criminals who aspire to be petty warlords, have drafted thousands of people into servitude to illegally mine gold and other resources.@@@Billions of dollars meant to improve the nation now fuel violent enterprises.@@@If left unchecked, they will threaten peace and place national security in grave danger.@@@Given the extent of that injustice and the high stakes involved, many Africans are asking whether the phenomenon is by accident or by design.@@@Member nations must reply by working with us to deter their firms and nationals from that twenty-first century pillage of the continent’s riches.@@@Fifthly, climate change severely impacts Nigeria and Africa.@@@Northern Nigeria is plagued by desert encroachment on once arable land.@@@Our south is pounded by the rising tide of coastal flooding and erosion.@@@In the middle, the rainy season brings floods that kill and displace multitudes.@@@As I lament deaths at home.@@@I also lament the grave loss of life in Morocco and Libya.@@@The Nigerian people are with them.@@@African nations will fight climate change but must do so on fair and just terms.@@@To achieve the needed popular consensus, the campaign must accord with overall economic efforts.@@@In Nigeria, we shall build political consensus by highlighting remedial actions that also promote economic good.@@@Projects such as a green wall to stop desert encroachment, halting the destruction of our forests by mass production and the distribution of gas-burning stoves, and providing employment in local water management and irrigation projects are examples of efforts that advance both economic and climate change objectives equally.@@@Continental efforts regarding climate change would register important victories if established economies were more forthcoming with public and private sector investment for Africa’s preferred initiatives.@@@Again, that would go far towards demonstrating that global solidarity is real and working.@@@As I close, let me emphasize that Nigeria’s objectives accord with the guiding principles of this world body: peace, security, human rights and development.@@@In fundamental ways, nature has been kind to Africa, giving it abundant land, resources and creative and industrious people.@@@Yet, man has too often been unkind to his fellow man and that sad tendency has brought sustained hardship to Africa’s doorstep.@@@To keep faith with the tenets of the world body and the theme of this year’s session of the Assembly, the poverty of nations 
must end.@@@The pillage of one nation’s resources by the overreach of firms and people of stronger nations must end.@@@The will of the people must be respected.@@@This beauty, generous and forgiving planet must be protected.@@@As for Africa, we seek to be neither appendage nor patron.@@@We do not wish to replace old shackles with new ones.@@@Instead, we hope to walk the rich African soil and live under the magnificent African sky free of the wrongs of the past and clear of their associated encumbrances.@@@We desire a prosperous, vibrant democratic living space for our people.@@@We will achieve it.@@@To the rest of the world.@@@I say.@@@“Walk with us as true friends and partners.@@@Africa is not a problem to be avoided nor is it to be pitied.@@@Africa is nothing less than the key to the world’s future.”@@@At the outset.@@@I would like to congratulate my Caribbean brother.@@@His Excellency Mr. Dennis Francis, on his election as the President of the seventy-eighth session of the General Assembly.@@@I would also like to take this opportunity to reiterate to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres the gratitude of the people of Haiti, who appreciated his recent visit to the country and his unwavering support for Haiti’s efforts to obtain strong support for the Haitian National Police from the Security Council.@@@I welcome the theme the President has chosen to guide our statements during this session.@@@“Rebuilding trust and reigniting global solidarity: accelerating action on the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals towards peace, prosperity, progress and the sustainability for all.”@@@We must therefore consider and propose solutions to the main global challenges to advance peace, security and sustainable development.@@@Indeed, it is difficult to imagine sustainable development without peace and security.@@@We need solidarity and determination to meet those challenges.@@@On the eve of the 2030 deadline, the world is in a bad way.@@@The outbreak of numerous conflicts with disastrous consequences for civilian populations, the multiplication of security, health and food crises, are all reminders that we are moving away from the great ideals of the Charter of the United Nations.@@@One example is the food insecurity caused by conflict and violence.@@@The Global Report on Food Crises 2023 indicates that 258 million people were acutely food insecure and in need of emergency food aid in 2022.@@@To that end, my country took part in the high-level public debate on famine and conflict- induced global food insecurity, organized in August by the Security Council (see S/PV.9392), with a view to sounding the alarm.@@@Since the crisis of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, the global economy has stagnated.@@@Inflation is ravaging many economies, and growth prospects are grim.@@@This situation affects the least developed countries, particularly Haiti, which is constantly having to cope with price volatility and a crisis marked by the deterioration of the country’s security situation.@@@Against this alarming backdrop, we should also mention the issue of climate change, which poses a constant threat to small island States, like Haiti, putting them to the test.@@@With each hurricane, the economies of the Caribbean region suffer enormous losses, calling into question the significant progress made 
on the socioeconomic and political fronts, through the destruction of economic, educational, health and energy infrastructure.@@@As Head of Government of Haiti, this debate is an opportunity for me to share the situation of my country, plunged into a deep crisis for years now.@@@We need to find concrete and sustainable responses.@@@This is a structural and multidimensional crisis, which has adversely affected our institutions and is hindering economic development and social progress.@@@The crisis has now reached a critical phase, with a deteriorating security situation in which the population is subjected daily to violent attacks by armed gangs that control several quarters of the capital and certain provincial towns.@@@They murder, set fire, pillage, rape and plunder with rare cruelty.@@@They drive people from their homes, block roads and force schools, hospitals and businesses to close.@@@The deterioration of the security situation in recent weeks has led to a new humanitarian crisis, with displaced persons spontaneously occupying various sites in order to escape gang violence.@@@More than 25 schools in the capital are being used by more than 16.500 displaced persons, according to estimates.@@@They are facing grave difficulties and living in subhuman conditions.@@@There is also a health threat, with cases of cholera reported in certain sites.@@@That increases the risk of transmission and poses a real public health problem for the population.@@@Abuses and systematic human rights violations caused by gang violence are jeopardizing the peace, stability and security of the country and the region.@@@Kidnappings, looting, arson, recent massacres, sexual and gender-based violence, organ trafficking, human trafficking, homicides, extrajudicial executions, the recruitment of child soldiers and blockades of main roads are just some of the crimes perpetrated by armed gangs.@@@That has had serious consequences for the economy, which has recorded five years of contraction, with a negative growth rate and a high inflation rate of nearly 40 per cent.@@@In addition, the humanitarian crisis is worsening.@@@According to estimates.@@@4.9 million people are food insecure.@@@That is almost half the population living below the poverty line, on less than $2 a day.@@@We are not here to cast blame or to justify the past.@@@We are here to ask friendly countries and all those who — from near or far — are watching our country and understand that urgent action must be taken to help the Haitian people and to create a better future for the children of Haiti by restoring security and stability.@@@In the past 15 years, the Haiti has lived through several shocks, one after the other — three major earthquakes, several cyclones and the heinous assassination of President Jovenel Moise in July 2021.@@@It is impossible today to invent or presented biased stories on Haiti.@@@The reality is plain to see and concerns us all.@@@A series of bad decisions, inappropriate actions and various strains of radicalism have led us to this state of affairs.@@@From this rostrum.@@@I now plead once again to help Haitians remain in their country.@@@Thousands are seeking elsewhere for a better life and the calm that their birth country can no longer offer them in a world where there are no more “golden lands” due to climate change and recurring economic crises.@@@On behalf of the Haitian people and the Government that I head.@@@I reiterate our plea to lend a strong hand to support the Haitian National Police so that it can truly respond to the challenges it faces and fulfil its mission of serving the people and protecting lives and property.@@@Certain countries have lived through situations similar to the current situation in Haiti.@@@The feeling of all-powerful criminality must not, for much longer, be allowed to ignore the laws of the Republic and block the will of the entire citizenry to regain their freedom of movement and to participate in their country.@@@Today Haitians can be found worldwide.@@@Many hope to be able to return to their country.@@@We are very grateful to the countries that have welcomed them, but I wish to tell them that as soon as order and stability return, they will be able to return — if they so desire — to participate in the great task of reconstruction.@@@On behalf of the Haitian people.@@@I have come here to declare that we are ready for the change that we have been waiting for more than 200 years.@@@Freedom is only complete if it enables all our citizens to fulfil their potential and to live in dignity and in decent conditions.@@@On behalf of the Haitian people.@@@I have come here to say that the issue of security remains my Government’s top priority and that trafficking in firearms, kidnappings for ransom and massacres are major concerns for my Administration.@@@The daily lives of the Haitian people are often filled with pain.@@@That is why the Security Council, which has the necessary power and competence under Chapter VII of the Charter, must act urgently to authorize the deployment of a multinational security support mission with both police and military components in order to help the Haitian National Police fight the gangs and restore order.@@@The use of force, as a first step, remains essential to creating an environment conducive to the proper functioning of the State.@@@But while it is a necessary prerequisite, it is not sufficient.@@@Socioeconomic development must be taken into account in order to sustainably address extreme poverty, the source of all our ills.@@@Social inequalities and the extremely unbalanced distribution of our national wealth have created a huge gap between the masses who are in need and the small minority of property owners who control 90 per cent of the country’s wealth.@@@Extreme poverty exacerbates youth unemployment, marginalizing young people in poor neighbourhoods so that they are easily drawn into delinquency and crime, making them a fertile recruiting ground for gangs.@@@Once again, from this rostrum.@@@I appeal to all Haitians of good faith, those who live in the diaspora as well as those in the country, and all political actors, whatever their leanings, to work with the Government to fight the gangs, restore security and, like true democrats, take power through the ballot box.@@@The interim Government that I lead is determined to hold elections as soon as possible, and in the coming days, despite the situation.@@@I will be finalizing an agreement with the High Transitional Council to launch the electoral process, with the support of the international community.@@@The Government intends to continue engaging in talks with all political and civil-society actors in my country, with a view to reaching a historic consensus together in a spirit of patriotism that can make it possible to resolve our crisis successfully.@@@Democracy is in trouble, and the country needs a return to normalcy if it is to tackle the big challenges of the day.@@@I also want to see women, young people, civil society and all other stakeholders participate meaningfully in a joint effort to bring about Haiti’s recovery.@@@Only a legitimate Government that is a product of free, honest, democratic and transparent elections can take on the task of territorial, economic, social and institutional reconstruction.@@@I would like to draw the international community’s attention to a situation that has developed on the Haitian-Dominican border in the past weeks, creating unnecessary tensions between the two republics that share our island.@@@I want to make it clear that Haiti is not at war with anyone.@@@Haitians are a generous people who believe in solidarity and dialogue and in the possibility of sharing common resources equitably, smoothly and in a mutually respectful manner.@@@I am here to say that we have no judgment or intentions that might adversely affect our neighbours, with whom we share the island and with whom we are called to live and progress.@@@Every day, history reminds us that violence between fraternal countries can lead only to regrets and bitterness that are passed down from generation to generation.@@@I have come here, above all, to convey to the Assembly the message of the Haitian people as a whole.@@@The river that we call the Massacre River, a place that has seen enormous friction between the Republic of Haiti and the Dominican Republic, both historically and today, calls on us to do our best not to rouse old demons, reopen old wounds or create new ones.@@@Haiti reaffirms the sovereign right of the Haitian people to use binational water resources in the same way that the Dominican Republic does, and it demands an equitable division of the river’s waters.@@@The Haitian people have chosen a path of dialogue and negotiation to peacefully settle the dispute, in compliance with the international legal instruments already signed in good faith between the two States in 1929 and 2021.@@@Before concluding.@@@I would like to take this opportunity to commend those countries that are our brothers and friends, as well as various international organizations, for their engagement and solidarity with Haiti, particularly Kenya, which has welcomed the idea of assuming the leadership of a multinational security support mission in Haiti and has already carried out an assessment mission in the country in August.@@@We also thank the Caribbean Community and its Eminent Persons Group.@@@Throughout history Haiti has been a symbol of freedom and solidarity.@@@We have always answered the call, coming to the aid of our fellow peoples in their legitimate struggle for freedom and self-determination, and we have done that within the United Nations itself.@@@The Republic of Haiti has identified with the universal values for which it fought in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.@@@Despite the unspeakable suffering and distress they are enduring, the Haitian people remain hopeful as they continue to pursue a better and more dignified future.@@@In the same way that they astonished the world in 1804 by radically changing their status from enslaved to free people, the Haitian people can once again redefine their destiny — and 
they want to.@@@That is why I am asking for support, in the spirit of that fraternal solidarity, to help us turn this dark page.@@@I ask the international community to act, and to act quickly.@@@Long live the renaissance of our relations with Mother Africa.@@@Long live international cooperation.@@@Long live Haiti.@@@First of all.@@@I would like to reiterate my warmest congratulations to Mr. Dennis Francis on his election as President of the General Assembly and to express our deep gratitude to his predecessor for the work he accomplished.@@@We are meeting at a time when the consequences of multiple security, economic and climate crises continue to strike our countries.@@@Poverty persists and is worsening in some parts of the world, while ecological disasters are proliferating, leaving countless victims in their wake.@@@We reiterate our condolences to the Governments and peoples of the Kingdom of Morocco and Libya regarding the recent earthquake and floods in their countries and reaffirm our full solidarity with them.@@@Technological innovations bring hope, but also legitimate fears about their potential destructive uses.@@@If we are to meet all those challenges together, more trust, more international cooperation and more solidarity are needed.@@@The theme chosen for the seventh-eighth session.@@@“Rebuilding trust and reigniting global solidarity: Accelerating action on the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals towards peace, prosperity, progress and sustainability for all”, while noble, requires tacit recognition that the trajectory we appear to be on is going in the opposite direction.@@@A lack of trust and mutual suspicion are omnipresent and negatively impact international cooperation.@@@The inclusive, integrated multilateralism called for by the Secretary-General is running up against the tendency to form clubs and groups — what one analyst has called minilateralism.@@@That erosion of confidence did not happen overnight.@@@It is the result of a slow 
deterioration due, on the one hand, to implacable resistance to change global institutions established at the end of the Second World War, and, on the other hand, to a deepening and fossilizing inequality and the heightened geopolitical competition of recent years.@@@However, in our view, this is not irreversible.@@@Therefore, it is essential that we make a massive investment in multilateral efforts to strengthen confidence and solidarity among States.@@@We see the United Nations at the heart of that effort.@@@Let us imagine together a multilateral system that takes into account the geopolitical realities of the time, including the proliferation of those groups, not in a context of institutional competition but of reinforced complementarity and close coordination, in which we can all commit, without reservation or hesitation, to renewing strong and indissoluble bonds of solidarity.@@@We must relearn to trust each other.@@@We need to build a reformed, fair and representative multilateral system in which everyone — the powerful and those less powerful — benefits.@@@Together, we must be able to send an unequivocal and unambiguous message that we are determined to build a strong Organization that responds in a credible manner to the enormous challenges of the moment.@@@Urgency must guide our action.@@@Delays in implementing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are damaging the credibility of the system.@@@We are halfway from where we need to be and a long way from reaching the Goals.@@@According to some estimates, if the pace remains the same and the volume of finance remains unchanged, it will take another 63 years to get there.@@@Almost a decade has passed since the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda.@@@Many commitments have been made since then, but unfortunately, we are in a worse situation today in which our countries have more needs now than they did a decade ago.@@@To that end, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has declared that a third of the world economy will be in recession by 2023, and for the first time, the United Nations Development Programme has also noted that the human development index is falling in nine out of ten countries.@@@In that regard, our country remains fully and constructively committed to intergovernmental negotiations for the Summit of the Future, which should accelerate the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@In addition, it is important to stress the crucial importance of reforming the international financial architecture and putting in place measures that go beyond gross domestic product so that we can close the gap in financing for development.@@@The increasing vulnerability of developing countries with regard to debt also calls for urgent additional measures to reform the international debt architecture.@@@Indeed, the high cost of borrowing, combined with declining public revenues, is preventing developing and least-developed countries from investing in the SDGs and is also increasing their risk of defaulting on their debt payments.@@@We must redouble our efforts to achieve our objectives by 2030.@@@This plan represents hope for humankind: we cannot give in to the temptation to give up.@@@We are aware that the difficulties are real, but they are not insurmountable.@@@The means to achieve our objectives are clearly set out in the Secretary-General’s SDGs stimulus package.@@@The urgent actions identified therein, namely, improving debt sustainability; reforming multilateral development banks, whose support is crucial to increase the financing of the Sustainable Development Goals; strengthening the global financial security net; reducing the systemic risk that weighs on the financial stability system; the international monetary system and strengthening global governance and policy consistency form the basis of a rescue plan for the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@If the Secretary-General’s rescue plan has not been sufficiently heeded up to now, it must be taken into account more in future discussions on a possible reform of the international financial architecture.@@@In that regard, we are encouraged by the statements of support that we heard during the general debate.@@@Reform of the international financial architecture, especially the IMF and World Bank, cannot wait.@@@We need to strengthen the participation of developing countries in international economic decision-making and in establishing new standards, so that we can adapt to changes in the global economy.@@@Together, we must accelerate the Bretton Woods moment which the Secretary-General referred to.@@@We must step up the dialogue on reforming the international financial architecture between multilateral financial institutions and the United Nations, while respecting the mandate of each organization.@@@Despite the global economic deterioration and the aforementioned challenges.@@@Djibouti has worked tirelessly to achieve the SDGs and has made notable progress in reducing malnutrition and undernutrition and has effectively managed the coronavirus disease pandemic.@@@Djibouti has integrated the SDGs into its national development plans and strategies, such as the Djibouti 2035 Vision.@@@Therefore, our Government has taken steps to align its policies and programmes with the targets and indicators of the SDGs.@@@We have also identified priority areas that correspond to specific SDGs, such as poverty reduction, access to drinking water and sanitation and sustainable economic growth.@@@In fact, our country is facing many challenges related to poverty, unemployment and infrastructure development, which are at the heart of the SDGs.@@@In addition, we have successfully collaborated with international organizations, donors and other countries to mobilize resources and expertise for the implementation of the SDGs.@@@Those partnerships are helping to strengthen support for achieving the Goals.@@@We have also been working to improve our data infrastructure to measure and report on the SDG indicators.@@@Our country is located in a region that is vulnerable to climate change, which is why we have made significant efforts in the area of climate action, in keeping with SDG 13 on action to combat climate change.@@@Those efforts include renewable energy projects and adaptation measures.@@@In addition to the large-scale geothermal projects currently under way.@@@Djibouti is proud to inform the friendly countries present in this Hall that we have inaugurated the very first wind farm, which will provide 60 megawatts of clean energy.@@@That project has been undertaken through a public private partnership and an additional capacity of 45 megawatts of renewable energy is expected through a consortium of investors and with the participation of the Port Authority and tax-free zones and the Djibouti Sovereign Fund.@@@The project will be the first significant international investment in the energy sector in Djibouti, in the amount of $122 million, establishing the country’s first independent power producer and serving as a model for future private investment.@@@The health and education systems are also priorities, and we are striving to improve health services and educational opportunities, in particular in remote and underserved areas.@@@Infrastructure development is also crucial for economic growth and sustainability, and Djibouti has invested in transport and logistics infrastructure to strengthen regional connectivity and trade, with a view to becoming an international and regional logistics hub.@@@Finally, in the area of peace and security.@@@Djibouti has played a major role in regional peacekeeping efforts and seeks to maintain stability throughout the Horn of Africa region.@@@All those commitments aimed at achieving the SDGs reflect our country’s efforts to address pressing challenges and improve the well-being of our people, while contributing to global sustainable development.@@@Climate change remains an existential threat to our countries.@@@It is a particularly acute reality in the Horn of Africa, but everywhere else in the world too.@@@The earthquake that led to the loss of several thousand lives in Morocco and the enormous amount of devastation caused by Cyclone Daniel in Libya serve as reminders for us all, hence the urgency of honouring the commitments undertaken in the Paris Agreement.@@@If nothing is done, the negative impact of climate change will continue to lead to significant disturbances, including many more extreme weather events, the scarcity of resources, sea level rise, an increase in the number of displaced people and the exacerbation of hunger and poverty.@@@We are deeply disappointed that the pledge to mobilize $100 billion each year has never been fulfilled, and we strongly urge developed countries to live up to that commitment.@@@We welcome the crucial decision taken at the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, in Sharm El-Sheikh, to create a loss and damage fund.@@@We call for its rapid operationalization and express the hope that the Transitional Committee’s recommendations on how the fund should operate can be adopted at the twenty-eighth Conference of the Parties, to be held shortly in the United Arab Emirates.@@@We are encouraged by the determination of the Somali Government to implement key national priorities on the basis of dialogue, including federal taxation and amendments to the national security architecture.@@@We urge it to continue that dialogue, in particular on the constitutional review process and all other outstanding issues.@@@The fight to liberate Somali territory from Al-Shabaab forces is critical.@@@The mobilization of all Somali forces, under the leadership of Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, deserves our full support until the ultimate goal is achieved.@@@However, we fear that the gains made on this front will be jeopardized by the decline in the number of soldiers in the African Union Transition Mission in Somalia, whose courage and self-sacrifice we salute.@@@While we understand the constraints linked to the financial resources available, the consequences of our decisions deserve to be carefully considered.@@@At this critical stage.@@@Somalia needs maximum support, commensurate with the threat it faces.@@@We remain concerned about the deteriorating security situation in the Sudan and call for the rapid establishment of a ceasefire and the immediate resumption of talks aimed at ending hostilities and undertaking political negotiations to resolve the crisis.@@@As current Chair of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development and under the leadership of President Ismael Omar Guelleh.@@@Djibouti is determined to work for lasting peace in this brotherly country with which we share close political, historical and cultural ties.@@@In South Sudan, we welcome the signing, in 2018, of the Revitalized Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan and call for the accelerated implementation of its pending provisions in order to bring the transition period to a close.@@@With regard to neighbouring Yemen, we agree with the members of the Security Council that the sustainable way out of the crisis is the conclusion of an inclusive peace agreement.@@@We welcome the transfer of oil from the decaying supertanker FSO Safer, moored off the Red Sea coast of Yemen, to a new vessel.@@@From the outset, the Republic of Djibouti has been committed at the highest level to lobbying the international community for a coordinated solution under the auspices of the United Nations.@@@If our region and the world had failed to act, the coasts of the Horn of Africa and the Arabian peninsula would have been polluted, thereby exposing communities to deadly toxins and contaminating drinking water supplies throughout the region.@@@Shipping through the Suez Canal would have been disrupted, cutting off food, fuel and vital supplies and exacerbating the already dire humanitarian conditions in Yemen.@@@In addition to its role as a rear base for withdrawing and coordinating sensitive and crucial activities, the Republic of Djibouti served the United Nations as part of the rescue operations of the FSO Safer, as a platform for securing and storing crude oil — more than 1 million barrels, which was transferred from that vessel to a tanker, the Nautica.@@@Through that collaboration.@@@Djibouti and the United Nations have saved the region from an ecological disaster that would have had extremely harmful effects on the environment, the economy and the health of all the populations of the countries bordering the Red Sea.@@@The international community was also spared an oil slick estimated to cost $20 billion to clean up.@@@At a time when the world is facing a multitude of urgent crises, this is a positive reference point and a model of international cooperation.@@@Now we need to finish the job by removing the FSO Safer from the Red Sea.@@@We are gravely concerned by the escalation of violence and the resumption of hostilities in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.@@@We are appalled by Israel’s continued illegal construction and expansion of settlements.@@@The resumption of hostilities and continued settlement activity jeopardizes the viability of the two- State solution.@@@In the face of rising despair, growing uncertainty and the absence of a political horizon, we must act.@@@The initiative to revitalize the Arab Peace Initiative, led jointly by Saudi Arabia.@@@Egypt and Jordan, the League of Arab States and the European Union, deserves our full support.@@@We have said this several times from this rostrum, and we will repeat it again today — we are a peace-loving nation, and we remain fully committed to completing the process of normalization with Eritrea and finding a lasting and peaceful settlement to the border dispute that continues to oppose us, as well as the other outstanding issues.@@@In conclusion.@@@I would like once again to urge the States Members of the United Nations to work together to build a safer, more prosperous and more united future in which war, hunger and poverty are no more.@@@I address the General Assembly on behalf of the President of the Presidential Council of the Government of National Unity of the State of Libya.@@@Mr. Mohamed Al-Menfi, who is unable to attend owing to the flood disaster in the eastern part of Libya.@@@I wish to begin by expressing my condolences to the people of Libya.@@@I convey my full sympathy and deepest condolences to the families of the victims of the floods and torrential rains that swept the cities and towns of Al-Jabal Al-Akhdar, in eastern Libya, in particular the city of Darnah.@@@Al-Lay da and Susah.@@@I also wish to convey my condolences and sincere sympathy to the people of Morocco, to His Majesty the King and to the Government following the earthquake that struck in several Moroccan cities.@@@I pray to God to speed the recovery of the injured.@@@I address the Assembly conveying the voice of my country.@@@Libya, which is in the throes of a painful tragedy.@@@I speak on behalf of the Libyan people with a heavy heart weighed down with sadness.@@@On Sunday morning.@@@10 September.@@@Libyans and the entire world awoke to a terrible scene, namely, a major disaster that hit the quiet Libyan city of Darnah, particularly following the tragedy that befell the cities and towns in Al-Jabal Al-Akhdar in the eastern part of the country, instantly claiming thousands of lives and missing persons in that city and region after the torrential rain swept away more than one quarter of the city.@@@Despite the efforts made by the Government of National Unity and the Libyan army from all over the country to address the disaster, evacuate the population, recover those still buried under rubble, bury the dead and contain the health situation in the city, the scale of the disaster has exceeded all local capacities and capabilities.@@@I would like to briefly address the brotherly and friendly countries that provided immediate assistance, sent specialized rescue teams and offered medical and logistical support.@@@I thank them all, brotherly and friendly countries that responded to our call, and I thank all the Heads of State who conveyed their condolences to us.@@@Speaking from this rostrum.@@@I call on the world to shoulder its responsibilities towards Libya by helping to deal with the aftermath of the disaster, in particular by taking the necessary health measures to protect the survivors in the city of Darnah and nearby cities from the health disaster about which experts warned.@@@The greatest values are borne out of suffering.@@@The disaster of the jasmine city gives strength to the one Libyan people and the spirit of unity, solidarity and rescue.@@@Since the tragedy, the Libyan people, from the far west to the far south, have set aside their political divisions and civil war in order to reveal their genuine roots, transcend the wounds of the past, set a course for the future and see things through the eyes of future generations, rather than those of politicians and war merchants.@@@That is clearly the lesson that we must pass on to our children so that the mistakes of this generation are not repeated.@@@The souls of the people of the city of 
prosperous Darnah will serve as lamps that illuminate for us the path of the homeland, reunification and State-building.@@@Through their solidarity and unity, our people revealed lessons of responsibility, love and national cohesion.@@@Their voices must be heard, and their opinions must be heeded.@@@It is time for democracy to take hold in Libya, grounded in the will and sincerity of the people, along with the support of countries friendly to the Libyan people as well as regional and international organizations, spearheaded by the United Nations, the African Union and the League of Arab States.@@@It is therefore necessary to have electoral legislation, unified authority and free elections, with logistic and technical international support.@@@In conclusion, the Libyan people do not need weapons to kill each other.@@@All the hotbeds of incitement and seeds of tension that negative international interventions created, which were sustained by narrow personal and factional ambitions, have been swept away by the torrents of Al-Jabal Al-Akhdar and Darnah.@@@A new era is born in which no voice is louder than the voice of the people; no interest supersedes the interest of the homeland; and no place exists for the corrupt and the war merchants.@@@On behalf of Senegal.@@@I wish President Dennis Francis every success in presiding over the work of the General Assembly.@@@I thank his predecessor and renew our support for the Secretary-General in the exercise of his duties in the service of the Organization.@@@Since our last session, the state of the world has not improved.@@@For millions of people, daily life remains marked by fear, violence, poverty and inequality.@@@Many countries continue to suffer the economic and social impact of the coronavirus disease pandemic.@@@Global warming has reached unprecedented levels.@@@The tragedy of irregular migration reminds us of the need to implement the Global Compact for Safe.@@@Orderly and Regular Migration, and to relentlessly pursue the fight against the criminal networks that organize the illicit traffic in human beings.@@@High-intensity warfare puts humankind at risk of major catastrophe.@@@In Africa, the resurgence of coups d’etat remains a matter of serious concern.@@@Senegal reiterates its strong condemnation of any form of unconstitutional change of Government.@@@The emergency of the hour is also terrorism, which continues to gain ground in Africa, without an appropriate reaction from the Security Council.@@@On numerous occasions, in particular during its mandate on the Council in 2016 and 2017.@@@Senegal has warned of the ineffectiveness of peacekeeping operations in Africa, whose mandates and equipment are barely able to respond to the nature of the situations.@@@There is no peace to maintain where instead it must be restored by fighting armed groups who pillage and slaughter innocent populations on a daily basis, occupy entire territories and threaten States in their very existence.@@@The tumultuous experiences of two current peace missions in Africa are edifying in that respect.@@@Consequently.@@@Senegal once again invites the Security Council to fully assume its responsibilities in the fight against terrorism in Africa by virtue of the collective security mechanism provided for by the Charter of the United Nations.@@@In the same spirit, we call for a de-escalation and peaceful settlement of the war in Ukraine.@@@We reiterate our support for the right of the Palestinian people to a viable State, coexisting peacefully with the State of Israel, each within secure and internationally recognized borders.@@@The theme of this session reminds us that the ideal underlying multilateralism is to create and promote trusting, supportive and inclusive relations among 
countries.@@@Senegal recognizes the valuable services that the United Nations and Bretton Woods systems have provided to member countries for almost 80 years, but we all know that the multilateral system, a legacy of a bygone past, has become obsolete.@@@However, as Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has rightly warned, a system that continues to ignore the realities of its time and the needs of more than three-quarters of its member countries accentuates inequalities, generates conditions that challenge it and causes the risk of its fragmentation.@@@If we want to avoid that dissolution, wisdom dictates that we reform global political, economic and financial governance to make it more representative of diversity and thereby reinforce its legitimacy.@@@We can get there if we put in the necessary political will.@@@The Group of 20 (G-20) demonstrated that by admitting the African Union as a full member.@@@I warmly thank the members of the G-20 for their unanimous support for that initiative, which Senegal put forward during its current presidency of the African Union.@@@We hope that the example of inclusion thus given by the G-20 will be followed by the Security Council and the Bretton Woods institutions, for a multilateralism more representative of the interests of all its members.@@@Likewise.@@@Senegal remains committed to the vision of peaceful international relations based on the equal dignity of peoples, cultures and civilizations.@@@On 31 October 1961, one year after our country gained its independence.@@@President Leopold Sedar Senghor expressed that vision here in these words:
“[N]o one particular civilization .., could be imposed without the bulk of mankind rising up against it” (A/PV.1045, para. 17).@@@Sixty-two years later, our position remains the same.@@@Among free peoples, whose history and sociocultural realities are diverse, there can be no legitimacy for some to define and impose on everyone else a single way of living, as a kind of civilizational ready-to-wear.@@@What works for some may not necessarily work for others.@@@Together, we can practice our shared values, but together we must respect our differences.@@@That, for Senegal, is what must establish a revitalized universalism, more open and more effective in addressing the challenges of our time.@@@Among those challenges is the climate emergency.@@@While extreme phenomena are increasing.@@@Senegal remains committed to the implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.@@@Thus, thanks to our proactive energy mix policy, renewable energies now represent 31 per cent of our established electrical capacity.@@@With the signing last June of our Just Energy Transition Partnership agreement, we aim to increase that rate to 40 per cent by 2030.@@@I thank the Group of Seven partner countries that are supporting us in mobilizing €2.5 billion over a period of three to five years, starting in 2023, to finance our projects under the Partnership.@@@At the same time, we are continuing to build low- carbon and climate-resilient infrastructure, including two projects for mass transport systems: a regional express train and a rapid transit bus line, both electric.@@@With the execution of national and continental projects, such as the Great Green Wall, our countries are clearly committed to climate action, within their means.@@@The fact remains that, for the most part, green projects in Africa are financed by recourse to commercial debt, whereas they should be supported by the mobilization of the $100 billion per year agreed at the fifteenth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 2009 to finance the climate action.@@@Climate justice would require that a continent that contributes less than 4 per cent of emissions yet suffers the most should not be condemned to fall into debt to repair and prevent damage for which it is not responsible.@@@Senegal is in favour of a just and equitable energy transition, taking into account the specific needs of our countries, including universal access to electricity, of which more than 600 million Africans remain deprived.@@@Thus, if we want the twenty-eighth Conference of the Parties to be the venue for promises kept, let us ensure that the funding announced is available and accessible according to simplified and transparent procedures and terms.@@@On 25 February 2024.@@@Senegal will hold its presidential election.@@@Like the previous ones, it will be democratic, free and transparent, and on 2 April.@@@I will hand over power to my successor after 12 years at the head of our country.@@@I would like to thank the States Members of our Organization for their friendship and cooperation.@@@Embodying the voice of Senegal, establishing and maintaining friendships in this concert of nations where our common efforts are harmonized towards our common ends has been a great honour for me.@@@On behalf of the Senegalese people.@@@I would like to express my gratitude to all my colleagues and to ask them to welcome my successor with the same friendship and consideration.@@@I will maintain the same feelings of cordial friendship and esteem for everyone.@@@I am confident that in the Senegalese tradition of openness and dialogue.@@@my successor will be faithful to the relations of trusting friendship that unite our country and all the Members of the United Nations.@@@Let me first congratulate the President on his election to lead the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session.@@@It is truly a great honour to be addressing the general debate of the Assembly for the first time in my capacity as the President of Slovenia, as this institution is facing the most challenging of times — times that we have not seen since the United Nations was first established.@@@I will return to that point again later.@@@We live in a world in which various actors, including private companies and individuals, affect international relations at every level and across sovereign boundaries.@@@It is a world that has changed demographically and technologically.@@@It is a world in which human dignity is still not guaranteed for all and is increasingly challenged for the most marginalized and vulnerable people.@@@It is a world with a set of normative commitments, including legally binding treaties, that are not being implemented.@@@It is a world of many wars, deadly conflicts and aggressions against States, and of the suffering of many civilians, who fear for their lives or are affected by the socioeconomic destruction caused by conflict.@@@It is a world that has not universally recognized the seriousness of the climate change unfolding before our eyes.@@@It is a world that lacks global solidarity for the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals that we have all committed to.@@@It is a world that needs the United Nations, with a reformed, representative Security Council that will be able to respond effectively, adequately and fairly to all the challenges I have mentioned.@@@We should tackle those challenges together as one.@@@If we continue to prioritize national interests, private interests or the particular interests of individual actors and leave the resolution of global problems on the sidelines, we will extinguish ourselves as a civilization.@@@In that context.@@@I would like to briefly touch on four issues that call for the attention of all of us and require that we all adopt and implement appropriate measures.@@@They are climate change.@@@Security Council reform, the pitfalls of the digital age and, of course, gender equality.@@@With regard to climate change, it may sound like a cliche to say that we need to abandon the “business as usual” mentality.@@@But it is not a cliche.@@@Business as usual is not working.@@@It is failing us all.@@@Climate change is the greatest challenge of our time.@@@The catastrophic floods that hit Slovenia in August were just one more event among the many around the world that prove the point.@@@I hope that we will be able to deal with the flooding’s consequences.@@@But let us think of countries that have less capacity to do so, such as small island developing States.@@@They are frequent victims of catastrophic natural disasters, but their recovery costs are disproportionately high.@@@Everyone should invest in an environmentally sustainable world, but I want to be clear — not everyone equally.@@@Global solidarity is a matter of climate justice.@@@Intergovernmental solidarity, with richer States contributing more than the poorer ones and with the richest private companies also contributing their fair share, must be guided by the understanding that climate change is a result of human activities, past and present.@@@I am therefore pleased to announce that Slovenia plans to increase its contribution to the Green Climate Fund by 50 per cent.@@@Addressing the growing financing gap between the needs of developing countries and the available financial resources is essential to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@However.@@@I am very concerned that the current geopolitical polarization is hindering collaborative climate action.@@@I only wish that in the circumstances scientists were listened to more.@@@According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, simply keeping our promises would already be a step in the right direction.@@@Sustainable development must become our joint and purposeful goal and the principle guiding everyone’s behaviour.@@@We must integrate climate action, as well as the related question of water and food security, into conflict prevention and resolution and sustainable peace-building.@@@Slovenia continues to be actively involved in ensuring climate and environmental justice, including the right to a clean and healthy environment, and in securing equitable access to safe drinking water and sanitation for all.@@@During the United Nations 2023 Water Conference.@@@I emphasized that water is life, water is existence and water is peace.@@@It is for that reason that I want to take this opportunity to repeat our call for the establishment of a United Nations special envoy for water, which would be an important step towards ensuring more coherent water efforts both inside and outside the United Nations.@@@On 6 June.@@@Slovenia was elected as a non-permanent member of the Security Council for the 2024-2025 term.@@@I would like to take this opportunity to thank all members for their confidence in electing my country to serve on the Council.@@@We will take on that task as a great honour, with profound humility and a sense of shared responsibility.@@@The work we will do in our term will be based on the numerous conversations and exchanges that we had with Member States during our campaign.@@@With regard to the Security Council.@@@I cannot avoid the discussions on its reform, which have been going on for decades.@@@I truly hope that we will soon see a light at the end of the tunnel.@@@Slovenia has always been among the Member States claiming that a change in the composition of the Council’s permanent and non-permanent membership is long overdue.@@@The current distribution of its seats is neither fair nor representative.@@@Furthermore.@@@Slovenia belongs to the majority of Member States that are deeply concerned about the unrestrained use of the power of the veto, which is causing us to lose faith in the Council, and has also resulted in its failing to act when action is required.@@@In Europe, we view Ukraine as a case in point.@@@Even some of the Council’s permanent members have suggested that the five permanent members of the Security Council (P5) should refrain from using the veto, at least in cases of mass atrocities.@@@We are all seeing that very valid suggestion ignored.@@@In that regard, we commend Liechtenstein’s recent introduction, through resolution 76/262, of the veto initiative as an important invitation to the P5 to reflect thoroughly on a situation before resorting to a veto.@@@At the same time, it should be recalled that the Charter of the United Nations itself gives the P5 an opportunity to express their displeasure with decision-making but still act responsibly.@@@They may not like a draft resolution, but they can choose to abstain in the voting and let the United Nations pursue its main goal without interruption — that of maintaining peace and security for all, not merely a few, and certainly not just one.@@@When we lose trust, we attack the very foundations of organized society in our international community.@@@I am afraid that in our digital age, part of the problem of losing trust lies with science and technology.@@@Inventions are meant to advance humankind.@@@Social media was not invented to disconnect us, but too often it does exactly that.@@@Artificial intelligence can be useful, but it can also be dangerous.@@@In that regard.@@@I applaud the Secretary- General’s resolve to form a high-level advisory body on artificial intelligence.@@@We need to find a way to govern the development of new technologies, including artificial intelligence, in a way that does not impede economic, development, social and research opportunities and does not put us at risk.@@@The answer should be a human-centric and human rights-based approach to the full life cycle of technologies, encompassing their design, development and application as well as their decline.@@@The Global Digital Compact should be centred on that notion.@@@Things can be done, but we will need all actors, including private companies, to be on board with an honest and meaningful commitment.@@@Ensuring that human rights are the foundation of an open, safe digital future will not be an easy task.@@@In that regard.@@@I am looking at a key menace of our time — disinformation.@@@Unfortunately, our time is once again one of competing narratives, except that now the threat they pose to humankind is much more complex.@@@We are in an era of snack news, an attention economy, the fabrication of facts and increasing disagreements about facts precisely because we no longer trust any narrative.@@@We may have freedom of information, but we are not protected against false information, manipulation and deceit.@@@The Secretary-General was on point when he referred to the proliferation of hate and lies in the digital space as grave global harm.@@@Big tech companies should take more systematic responsibility for the content they host and moderate.@@@They should better protect users from hate speech, disinformation and other harmful online content.@@@What is unacceptable offline should not be acceptable online.@@@I am about to say a few words on a subject so important that I have saved it for the last part of my address — gender equality.@@@This year we are celebrating the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.@@@It saddens me that today we are still facing the fact that half of the world’s population, women and girls, experience inequality, exclusion and even brutal violence.@@@Their societal marginalization, often coupled with poverty and a lack of opportunities for receiving quality education, and with exclusion from labour markets and decision-making processes, is not only unjust but also results in a monumental waste of potential for our societies.@@@To ensure dignity for everyone, including women and girls, we all must pursue that goal, whether in the West.@@@East.@@@North or South, or anywhere in between.@@@We should start at home, and in our United Nations home.@@@In that regard.@@@I would like to recall an astounding detail that illustrates the need to take Sustainable Development Goal 5 very seriously.@@@It is that it will take 140 years to achieve the equal representation of women in leadership positions in the workplace.@@@I think that is simply unacceptable, and the Secretary-General agrees.@@@The achievement of women’s full, equal and meaningful participation in political and public life is part of his New Agenda for Peace.@@@That is why I am very much in favour of initiatives to achieve that objective, including within the framework of the United Nations.@@@On that particular point.@@@I am thinking of the initiative from the Group of Women Leaders Voices for Change and Inclusion aimed at alternating the gender of the presidency of the General Assembly.@@@The President here leads an Assembly of the world’s most important global institution.@@@We are all painfully aware that so far only four Presidents of the General Assembly have been women — four in its entire history — while 74 have been men.@@@We should live up to our own declarations on gender equality and make them a reality in the work of the General Assembly as well.@@@That would be a vivid and symbolic way of demonstrating our joint commitment.@@@As I leave this rostrum.@@@I would like to reaffirm the need for multilateralism.@@@It needs to be a different type of multilateralism, one that is effective and inclusive, making the United Nations an actor and a forum fully fit for the future.@@@The most pressing challenges today — and I have elaborated on some of them — cannot be addressed by individual States, whatever their size or power.@@@This must be a collective effort, or our children and grandchildren will be affected far more deeply than the generation of leaders gathered here.@@@We must work for a new global compact that needs to be principled, to rise above individual interests and be based on global solidarity.@@@It needs to prioritize the protection of nature and human dignity, and it also needs to have a long horizon.@@@Slovenia is fully committed to contributing to the Pact for the Future, and we look forward to actively engaging in the upcoming Summit of the Future next year.@@@We must be ambitious, even if we do not agree on solutions to all the emerging challenges.@@@We need to use our power and resources to put all our collective efforts into action in order to solve them.@@@Better one by one than none.@@@At the outset allow me, to share warm greetings from the Government and the people of the Republic of Kiribati.@@@In the name of the Almighty God in whom we place our trust and who is our anchor of solidarity.@@@Kam na bane n Mauri\
I join previous speakers in congratulating President Dennis Francis on his election and I wish him every success as he guides these important deliberations.@@@The theme of this debate.@@@“Rebuilding trust and reigniting global solidarity: Accelerating action on the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals towards peace, prosperity, progress and sustainability for all”, resonates deeply with the aspirations of our people.@@@In our fast-changing world, predicated by multiple challenges, part of the theme — “rebuilding trust and reigniting global solidarity” — is very timely and crucial.@@@As we all know, trust is the corner stone of any relationship, which, when strained, creates uncertainties, mistrust and instability.@@@Geopolitical tensions, economic disparities and the unforeseen challenges brought about by events like pandemics, climate-related crises and disasters have tested the resolve of national Governments, their peoples and their partners.@@@The call to rebuild trust therefore highlights the need for countries to re-establish faith in multilateral cooperation and diplomacy.@@@It highlights the importance of transparent communication, mutual understanding and engaging with each other to forge strategic partnerships for our common good and development.@@@A renewed commitment to accountability, good governance and responsive policies can contribute to promoting a more engaged and empowered global community.@@@At the same time, the call to reignite global solidarity reflects our recognition that our global challenges and opportunities are intertwined.@@@It encourages countries not only to recognize but also to deliver actions to resolve issues such as poverty, inequality, climate change and health care.@@@The idea of global solidarity underscores the principle that no nation can thrive in isolation and recognizes the uniqueness of each country’s context and need.@@@The experience of the coronavirus disease pandemic is exemplary of the world coming together as one family.@@@While we recognize the essential need for science to address pandemics, it is important for Member State to work together to gain a better understanding of the variants and vaccines before they are rolled out.@@@Since the launching of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015, my Government has launched Kiribati’s first-ever long-term development plan, identifying our priorities for development.@@@The Kiribati 20-Year Vision is rooted firmly in the needs of all I-Kiribati and commits my Government to transforming Kiribati into a wealthier, healthier and peaceful nation.@@@It recognizes the need to align our national priorities with the SDGs and complement our national efforts with those outlined by our United Nations family.@@@In 2018, my Government became one of the few Member States to deliver a voluntary national report, outlining our policy actions to achieve our SDGs.@@@The report enabled us to take stock of our development and assess our future.@@@To ensure sustainability and ownership of our desired development goals, we have engaged in extensive consultations at all levels.@@@As the year 2030 is imminent, time is of the essence.@@@It is imperative for our United Nations family to stay on track in our efforts to achieve our goals set forth in the SDGs.@@@That will entail setting ambitious targets and mobilizing resources, technology, innovation and policy changes to ensure that the goals are achieved on time.@@@However, there is no guarantee that the SDG goals will be achieved; therefore; Kiribati’s graduation from the status of least developed country would not be sustainable.@@@Since our independence in 1979, our nation has enjoyed 44 years of stable and peaceful governance.@@@We continue to recognize the independence of the three arms of Government, trusting that each arm discharges its duties with the highest level of integrity in a transparent, respectful and honest manner.@@@We are committed and determined to ensure that Kiribati remains peaceful as we chart our future.@@@But peace can be precarious as determining factors are often beyond our control.@@@We have the human resources yet lack the capacity or necessary skills to develop our country.@@@Equally important is our commitment to maximizing 
benefits to our people, uplifting our communities and maintaining our cultural values for peace.@@@During this year’s national day celebrations, after so many years Kiribati for the first time in its history successfully reunited all faith-based organizations to gather again as one family under one roof to worship God.@@@All Christian denominations, including the Baha’i faith and followers of Islam in Kiribati, rejoiced in songs of praise and in richness of prayers.@@@During that worship, it was heartening to be in an atmosphere where one could truly feel the grace, peace and love of God.@@@Also, recognizing that the greater humility of being an I-Kiribati is far more effective than the differences among faiths in sustaining peace.@@@We invite the rest of the world to follow that example.@@@As part of our commitment to global peace, my Government is working closely with the United Nations to engage our police in the United Nations peacekeeping missions, with the support of various partners.@@@We will commit to supporting gender balance in recognition of Kiribati’s ongoing commitment to equal representation and opportunities.@@@In addition.@@@Kiribati has strengthened its policies and laws to support and empower women and girls, people with disabilities, elders, the unemployed, youth and children.@@@We must recall our commitments under our Charter of the United Nations to building a safe, peaceful and secure home for our peoples, individually as sovereign nations and collectively as Members of the United Nations.@@@In Kiribati, we strongly believe that this is deeply threatened and undermined by the continued existence of nuclear weapons, the discharge of nuclear- treated water and the leakage of radioactive materials into the blue Pacific Ocean.@@@The existence of nuclear weapons also diminishes trust in the commitment of our United Nations family members to peace and stability if they continue to manufacture and possess nuclear weapons.@@@Kiribati will continue promoting the non-proliferation and ultimately the total elimination of nuclear weapons at our United Nations, in particular our obligations in keeping our region, our land, our upper airspace and our ocean free of environmental destruction and pollution by radioactive wastes and other materials, including plastics.@@@Most important is the health of our people, especially those who were exposed to the nuclear test blasts on Christmas Island and those whose ancestral lands have been exploited, leaving pinnacles behind.@@@Compensation must be made to those on Christmas Island, including the Banaban people affected by environmental degradation, to rebuild trust.@@@One of the global challenges and grave concerns that impacts our lives and future is corruption.@@@The Government recognizes that fighting corruption is critical to achieving sustainable development, and accordingly hosted the first ever regional anti-corruption conference for Pacific leaders in 2020.@@@The outcome of the conference.@@@Teieniwa Vision, reaffirms Pacific unity against corruption and integrates good governance principles into participants’ broader development agenda.@@@At the international level, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, along with the General Assembly, can lead the way by ensuring that anti-corruption efforts are prioritized in our pursuit of global sustainable development, with SDG 16 as our guidepost.@@@Enhancing prosperity is essential to sustaining peace, and so the Government is dedicated to people-centric principles, placing citizens at the centre of our decisions and services and promoting transparent governance.@@@We value continuous learning and capacity development for a competent public service to deliver on development goals.@@@Building capacity and the transfer of knowledge to enhance the capability of our people is sustainable.@@@It allows our people to take ownership of our own national processes and procedures, thereby guiding our development.@@@We acknowledge the support of our development partners, which needs to be well coordinated and harmonized to ensure fair and inclusive distribution and the allocation of limited resources among competing needs.@@@We are committed to expanding access to overseas labour markets, providing decent work conditions and adhering to international labour standards.@@@In education, we invest in our young generation and educators, support accessible, well-resourced schools for quality learning environments, and ensure equal access to high-quality education at all levels to nurture our people and move our nation forward.@@@In our pursuit of SDG acceleration.@@@Kiribati is faced with significant challenges due to its geographical isolation, the scattered situation of its islands within its 3.5 -million-square-kilometre economic exclusive zone, and its vulnerability to climate change, to name but a few.@@@In the face of those significant challenges, the delivery of essential services such as education, health, security, including the implementation of 
activities related to achieving the SDGs in Kiribati, is very costly.@@@We should be given increased access to financial resources to obtain equipment, infrastructure and other benefits to achieve the SDGs and, at the same time, develop our country.@@@That includes an urgent call to scale up global financial resources and simplify guidelines to allow easy access.@@@Achieving those will guarantee that Kiribati is placed in a better position to sustain peace and harmony.@@@With a vast ocean and airspace.@@@Kiribati’s resources are central to our survival, development and security.@@@To harness our ocean resources sustainably, we need financial assistance and access to the right capabilities, technology and equipment.@@@Likewise, the management of our airspace is important for security purposes.@@@It will enable us to effectively manage our maritime domain and airspace, ensuring responsible utilization while protecting our fragile ecosystem.@@@At the forefront of climate change.@@@Kiribati is experiencing intensifying severe drought and coastal inundation affecting homes, public infrastructure, food and water security.@@@The projected cost for adaptation has significantly increased.@@@Therefore, developed countries are urged to put more funds beyond the global pledge agreed to in Paris.@@@That would also finance loss and damage and facilitate investment in early warning systems and forecasts.@@@With that said, it would help our people adapt to changing environmental conditions and to build resilience in our communities.@@@Sustainability has become the new governance imperative, which needs to be clearly understood.@@@As leaders of today, it is vital that we know exactly what we want to sustain and at what scale, and to be wary of the implications.@@@That will require us to be more diligent, patient and hard-working with sheer determination to ensure that the sustainability of resources, efforts and time is optimally maximized for the betterment of all.@@@In conclusion, on behalf of the Government and the people of Kiribati.@@@I should like to join previous speakers in offering our condolences to the Governments and the peoples of Morocco and Libya with respect to the tragedy that have faced.@@@May God bless them.@@@In conclusion, let us embrace our traditional blessings of Te Mauri, Te Root ao Te Tabomoa, which literally means “Health, peace and prosperity”.@@@On behalf of the Government and the people of Jamaica.@@@Mr. President.@@@I extend warmest congratulations to you on your election.@@@We are proud to see a son of the Caribbean presiding over this pivotal seventy-eighth session of the General Assembly.@@@We share your vision of a world in which trust is rebuilt, global solidarity is reignited and action is accelerated for the benefit of all our peoples.@@@You can count on our fullest support in that endeavour.@@@We meet at a time when the need for deliberate action is urgent on several global fronts.@@@The Secretary- General has sounded the alarm and issued strong appeals for greater ambition and action.@@@Young people all over the world have been expressing their frustrations and have been calling for more from us as leaders.@@@We must act now if we are to meet the hopes, dreams and aspirations of present and future generations.@@@Jamaica has long been committed to ambition and action beyond our size.@@@Notwithstanding our limitations as a small island developing State, and even in the face of enormous challenges, we have made significant strides in recent years in the delivery of peace, prosperity and progress for our people.@@@That has not been easy.@@@It has required bold, strategic, inclusive and steady leadership, sustained commitment, hard decisions and great collective sacrifice.@@@We are a country with a strong track record of peace, democratic traditions, political stability and respect for human rights.@@@We are also now an economy that is growing in resilience and sustainability, having emerged from the pandemic in acceleration mode — a place where businesses can easily be started and can thrive, and where jobs are being created for women and men.@@@Inspired by our motto.@@@“Out of Many.@@@One People”, we are building a cohesive society with opportunities for everyone to achieve their full potential.@@@Peace is not merely the absence of conflict.@@@It is a social condition defined by mutual respect and the acknowledgement of our shared humanity.@@@It permits our societies to channel our collective energies towards building a better future for ourselves, our children and generations to come.@@@In our own journey towards peace, as we tackle the twin-headed monster of crime and violence.@@@Jamaica has invested heavily in the men and women of our security forces and the technology and infrastructure needed to support their work.@@@Improved working conditions, increased mobility and the use of forensics and new legislative tools are delivering results.@@@In that regard, we welcome a 22-per cent reduction in serious crimes since the start of the year.@@@We know there is much more to be done.@@@We are committed to using every lawful tool to save lives and to ensure social cohesion, inclusivity and respect for the inherent dignity of every human being.@@@Those elements are now embedded in the training and capacity-building of our security forces.@@@Furthermore, we await the report of the Violence Commission appointed by Prime Minister Andrew Holness to make recommendations for fundamental, holistic and inclusive solutions to the multifaceted challenges of crime and violence.@@@We simply cannot, however, win that fight alone.@@@Small island States like ours, with porous borders, rely on global partnerships to combat trafficking in persons, arms and drugs.@@@Jamaica does not manufacture guns or ammunition.@@@Countries that do and which serve as major consumers of drugs must do more to prevent their outflow and to fight those elements of transnational organized crime, which have massive impacts on developing countries like ours in the Caribbean region.@@@Last year in this very Hall.@@@Prime Minister Holness called for a war on guns comparable to the war on drugs (see A/77/PV.9).@@@As he also said more recently at the International Drug Enforcement Conference XXXVII, which Jamaica co-hosted.@@@“[t]he war on drugs must be reciprocated, complemented and fought in parallel with the war on guns...@@@Our joint efforts not only seek to combat illegal firearms and drugs, but also to fortify international collaboration, reinforcing our pursuit of justice and security”.@@@We also recognize the threat posed to peace and security in the digital space, and therefore continue to work to advance our domestic capacity, as well as multilateral efforts to address cybersecurity.@@@We are also honoured to lead the work of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) work towards the conclusion of a United Nations convention on cybercrime to buttress global measures.@@@Those are not only high-flown concepts; all have direct implications for the efforts of Governments of developing countries, like Jamaica, to deliver safe communities — real and virtual — in which families can live, work, go to school and achieve their dreams.@@@On the matter of international peace and security.@@@Jamaica firmly believes that dialogue, diplomacy and cooperation are the most effective pathways to resolving competing interests.@@@Jamaica therefore calls on all nations to prioritize the pursuit of peace over the perpetuation of conflict and aggression.@@@We reiterate our call for an end to the war in Ukraine and urge parties to regional and civil wars to choose dialogue and coexistence over conflict, as it is ordinary people and the most vulnerable people who suffer the devastating consequences of war.@@@We are proud that Latin America and the Caribbean remains a declared zone of peace and a nuclear-free zone.@@@We are, however, gravely concerned about growing global tensions and risks associated with nuclear proliferation, safety and use.@@@Jamaica reiterates our long-standing position that all States must heed the call for nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, and refrain from the testing, use and threat of use of nuclear weapons.@@@I must use this opportunity to reiterate Jamaica’s and CARICOM’s call for international action to restore order and security in our sister nation.@@@Haiti.@@@It is critical that we all fully support all meaningful efforts to contribute to Haitian-led solutions to the multidimensional and multifaceted challenges with which that country is faced.@@@Let me be clear — there are no easy fixes.@@@But let me be equally clear — doing nothing is not an option.@@@Jamaica supports the call for a multinational security support mission to bolster the Haitian National Police in their efforts to vanquish ever-strengthening criminal gangs.@@@Prime Minister Holness has made clear, that subject to the relevant Security Council resolution.@@@Jamaica will contribute personnel to such an effort.@@@We listened in Port-au-Prince when the CARICOM mission visited earlier this year.@@@We have also heard the clear call of the majority of the Haitian people, as reflected in the polls conducted in Haiti by reputable local civil society and international agencies.@@@We therefore urge the permanent members of the Security Council to put aside geopolitical sensitivities and to answer the call of the majority of the Haitian people and their brothers and sisters in the Caribbean region.@@@A Security Council resolution under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, authorizing a multinational security support mission, must be adopted without further delay.@@@We join CARICOM’s commendations of President Ruto for Kenya’s steadfast commitment to leading such a mission and welcome the offers from other countries, including from our own region.@@@We call on other capable countries and other capable regions to lend their, financial, human, logistical and in-kind support to ensure that the mission on which we must embark will be effective in delivering peace and stability for the people of Haiti.@@@Despite the many competing issues.@@@Jamaica could not be clearer.@@@Ordinary Haitians are suffering.@@@Humanitarian support cannot be distributed in insecurity; hospitals cannot deliver care in insecurity; children cannot go to school in insecurity; men and women cannot go to work in insecurity.@@@Candidates cannot offer themselves for election in insecurity, and people cannot vote in insecurity.@@@The situation can and will become even worse if we do not act without delay.@@@Peace and reasonable stability are indisputably necessary preconditions for each and every aspect of support and short-, medium- and long-term development in Haiti, including the holding of free and fair elections.@@@We may rest assured that only chaos will reign if the international community remains distracted and fails to act.@@@We must meet the moment.@@@Jamaica will also continue to lend its support to the CARICOM Eminent Persons Group as it works with the Haitian Government and stakeholders towards a Haitian-owned solution to the political and governance crisis that has gripped the nation.@@@Having hosted the first meeting of the Group with stakeholders in Kingston in May, we remain unwavering in our commitment to working towards a sustainable political outcome.@@@We want Haiti — the first independent black republic — to be able to deliver, for its people, the prosperity they have always deserved.@@@Jamaica itself has been undergoing a significant transformation over the past several years, fostering a growing sustainable economy.@@@From farm roads to bridges and highways, from wind turbines to solar panels, from fibre optics to satellite connectivity, increased investment in infrastructure is playing a pivotal role in that transformation.@@@Our efforts to diversify and modernize critical industries such as tourism, agriculture, manufacturing, and global services, including business process outsourcing, have yielded substantial results.@@@We have not only increased economic growth but also created new employment opportunities for our citizens.@@@This year.@@@Jamaica achieved its lowest unemployment rate on record, at 4.5 per cent.@@@Fiscal responsibility and prudent economic management have been central to our achievements.@@@We have paid down our debt, expanded revenue by including more people in the formal economy and improved tax collection.@@@We have established an independent central bank and legislated fiscal rules, ensuring a stable macroeconomic environment.@@@We recognize the need, however, to ensure that there is an appropriate balance between macroeconomic performance and social cohesion so that as many people as possible benefit from growth and stability in the economy.@@@Since April 2022, we have granted the largest increases in minimum wage in the past 20 years, cumulatively amounting to 86 per cent.@@@We have conducted the largest and most comprehensive public sector compensation review, implemented a social pension for the elderly, and increased the benefits under and expanded student beneficiaries of our social safety net programme.@@@We have also broadened coverage of our national health fund and are investing in health infrastructure.@@@Despite several external shocks, our people have remained resilient and we remain poised for even greater growth and development.@@@We have invested heavily in our young people, establishing a new coding academy, providing scholarships in science, technology, engineering and mathematics to students and student teachers at tertiary institutions, and removing all fees from our national skills training agency up to associate degree level.@@@We are partnering with the private sector for internships and employment to ensure that our young people are not only catalysts but beneficiaries of sustained economic growth.@@@Jamaica also remains committed to women’s economic empowerment, the achievement of gender equality and the elimination of violence against women and girls, and has embarked on an extensive process of policy and legislative reforms.@@@In February.@@@Jamaica established a Bicameral Caucus of Women Parliamentarians to bolster our efforts to coalesce around women’s issues and ensure that the needs of women and girls are adequately reflected in our legislative framework.@@@On 1 July, the new Sexual Harassment Act came into effect and sensitization sessions have now started.@@@The Government has also ramped up the mainstreaming of a gender perspective in the development of its policies through the institutionalization of gender focal points across the public sector.@@@Jamaica is working to demonstrate its commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in action.@@@As a small island developing State (SID), an enabling global environment is essential for Jamaica to build on that foundation.@@@We are proud to have led and participated in global efforts to pursue reform of the international financial architecture and to improve access to affordable financing for development, including climate finance.@@@More work, however, is needed in that regard to facilitate inclusiveness and equity for all States, and particularly for highly indebted and vulnerable small island developing States.@@@We will therefore continue our advocacy to build momentum towards ambitious and pragmatic solutions.@@@The multidimensional vulnerability index is urgently needed to address the vexed issue of graduation on the basis of per capita income only, and its implications for access to concessional finance and grant funding are critical.@@@We look forward to the report of the High- Level Panel on the Development of a Multidimensional Vulnerability Index for Small Island Developing States and its early adoption by the international financial community.@@@The pandemic taught us many lessons that we cannot afford to forget.@@@For developing States, it exacerbated previously existing inequities and inequalities within and among countries.@@@In terms of trade in services, global tourism and its related sectors were disproportionately impacted as the pandemic exposed the vulnerability of those industries.@@@Massive global disruptions and unemployment were the result.@@@Jamaica, as a leading tourism destination, recognizes the value of resilient tourism for economic, social and environmental development.@@@Last year from this very rostrum.@@@Prime Minister Holness issued the call for the declaration of an annual global tourism resilience day.@@@I humbly express our sincere gratitude to all Member States for answering that call with the General Assembly’s designation, by consensus, of 17 February as Global Tourism Resilience Day.@@@We look forward to collaborating with them on innovations to deepen the resilience of the sector.@@@A strong, robust and inclusive multilateral system, with the United Nations at its centre, remains the single most effective means of ensuring international cooperation towards a sustainable future.@@@It is the forum in which small States have an equal voice and equal participation in global decision-making.@@@Unfortunately, the multilateral system itself has faced significant challenges over the past few years: the pandemic, a war in Europe, shifting geopolitical tides and a stubborn resistance to the realities of climate change, to name a few.@@@Defying the odds, however, our collective endeavours resulted in the adoption of the agreement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction in June.@@@As a sustainable ocean economy, the seat of the International Seabed Authority and the home of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.@@@Jamaica actively participated in the negotiations and looks forward to its early entry into force and effective implementation towards the sustainable use and conservation of our invaluable ocean resources.@@@Jamaica also welcomes the adoption of the Kunming- Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, which will catalyse action to halt and reverse biodiversity loss.@@@That hard-won victory for sustainable development highlights our shared commitment to protecting 30 per cent of terrestrial, coastal and marine areas by 2030.@@@Both those landmark agreements, attained through multilateral action, will make an impactful contribution to furthering our shared objective of benefiting from our natural resources now, but in a way that ensures their sustainability for future generations.@@@As we look forward to the twenty-eighth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP28), we recall the breakthrough agreement secured at COP27 to establish a Loss and Damage Fund.@@@The work of the Transitional Committee will be vital to ensuring that the Fund 
can be properly structured and operationalized.@@@SIDS are counting on meaningful progress in that regard.@@@We also expect that all States will commit to the achievement of net zero fossil fuel production and to keeping 1.5°C alive.@@@We are playing our part through our more ambitious nationally determined contributions to bolster our society, economy and country against the existential threat of climate change.@@@In that regard, we are working assiduously to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions; to increase reforestation, including through our 3 million trees in 3 years project; to reduce plastic waste, including in the marine environment; to accelerate the energy transition towards renewables; and to address coastal erosion and risks to biodiversity both on land and at sea.@@@Notwithstanding our efforts, the responsibility for effective action is a global one, as the wide-ranging consequences of inaction are equally global.@@@Having just completed the Climate Ambition Summit, we urge major and emerging economies to elevate their ambition and to deliver on their commitments under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.@@@That is a matter of survival for all our countries and peoples, especially small island developing States.@@@Therefore, as we prepare for the fourth International Conference on SIDS, to be held in Antigua and Barbuda in May 2024, we look forward to assessing the progress to date and the remaining gaps in the implementation of previous plans of action.@@@The Conference will also set the agenda for the programme of action for the sustainable development of SIDS for the next 10 years.@@@Jamaica looks forward to having tangible outcomes focusing on the climate crisis, biodiversity and issues related to debt.@@@As we mark the mid-point of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, we must channel our fullest efforts towards accelerating achievement of the SDGs through partnerships and a whole-of-society approach.@@@At the SDG Summit last week, we recognized the mutually reinforcing and cross-cutting nature of the SDGs and that we must turbocharge our efforts to attain the transformation we need for people, planet and prosperity.@@@As we all work towards the attainment of the SDGs.@@@Jamaica joins the international community in the unanimous call for ending the economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed against Cuba.@@@Our shared commitment to achieving progress, prosperity and sustainability for all cannot be fulfilled until we have definitively closed the chapter on slavery and its legacies in our global history.@@@The residual impact of the immorality of slavery and the transatlantic slave trade has lingered for far too long, and justice and accountability are long overdue.@@@The systemic imbalances caused by centuries of exploitation constitute the foundation of the persistent underdevelopment that countries like Jamaica have worked hard to overcome.@@@Jamaica therefore reaffirms its determination to further the call for the international recognition of reparatory justice as a necessary path to complete healing, the restoration of dignity and progress for people of African descent.@@@Together, we must stride confidently forward in good faith, building on the lessons of that horrific past and moving purposefully towards a common future.@@@Furthermore.@@@Jamaica supports the call for an extension of the International Decade for People of African Descent, as insufficient progress has been made to address racial injustices worldwide.@@@Complex global problems demand comprehensive global responses.@@@As we work during this seventy-eighth session to achieve and maintain lasting peace, to attain and build shared prosperity and to accelerate meaningful progress and sustainability.@@@Jamaica will remain hopeful that, together, we can overcome the major challenges that stand in our way.@@@Genuine political will and innovative thinking are required to not only identify solutions but to also pursue them diligently and consistently until the desired results are achieved.@@@I assure you.@@@Mr. President, and all delegations of Jamaica’s unwavering commitment, support and partnership in that noble effort.@@@Costa Rica congratulates the President of the General Assembly on his election and reiterates its commitment to work to achieve the goals we have set for this session.@@@We face old and new challenges, in the form of conflict 
that is spreading like wildfire throughout every corner of the globe.@@@With regard to the war against Ukraine.@@@Costa Rica urgently calls for concrete and immediate steps to be taken to establish a ceasefire and draw up a peace plan under which the Russian Federation is to withdraw its troops and be held accountable under international law for its actions.@@@My country regrets Russia’s suspension of the Black Sea Grain Initiative.@@@It is clear to Costa Ricans that this conflict has implications beyond Ukraine’s borders, including food insecurity for States that rely on Ukrainian wheat and Russian fertilizers.@@@In such an interconnected world, it is imperative to recognize that there are no longer geographical boundaries when it comes to both the consequences of conflict and climate catastrophe.@@@And the poorest and most vulnerable bear the heaviest burden.@@@Nevertheless, there is still time to correct the course of our inaction.@@@I have therefore come to propose that we use this new session to promote actions in four areas.@@@The first is strengthening our collective security architecture.@@@The second is a new global social compact.@@@The third is the reform of the international financial system.@@@And the fourth is to reframe our relationship to the planet.@@@Exceptional circumstances require courage and leadership to prevent our collective security architecture from collapsing before us like a house of cards.@@@Courage is needed to reach compromises to enable us to overcome the status quo and undertake positive reforms.@@@We are faced not only with the paralysis of the Security Council but also with the clear violation of the Charter of the United Nations itself by one of the permanent members and the almost generalized non-compliance with international treaties on disarmament, non-proliferation and arms control by those who are supposed to guarantee our security.@@@In addition, we urgently need new governance frameworks on cybersecurity, cybercrime and artificial intelligence.@@@The militarization of new technologies poses specific problems.@@@Therefore, in accordance with what was agreed in the Belem communique and, together with Austria and Mexico, we will submit a draft resolution to the General Assembly that addresses the issue of autonomous weapons systems.@@@For Costa Rica, it is clear that the responsibility for the sustainability of the financing of peace should be mostly borne by those who violate it.@@@And I say that because almost 15 years ago military spending was slightly over $1 trillion.@@@Ten years later, global military spending has more than doubled, exceeding $2 trillion, despite the fact that Article 26 of the Charter of the United Nations prescribes the pursuit of international peace and security with minimum spending on arms.@@@Costa Rica calls for the mandate of Article 26 to be honoured and calls on all Member States to commit to the intentional and sustained reduction of military spending.@@@Our only weapon should be international law.@@@Therefore.@@@Costa Rica welcomes the fact that the General Assembly is assuming the functions granted to it by the Charter with a more active role in international peace and security.@@@My country is also proud to be at the forefront of that trend and is committed to continuing on that path, because we cannot afford to wait for a dysfunctional Security Council to fulfil its obligations.@@@Human security is the foundation of a new global social compact, a compact that refocuses our development efforts and international cooperation on the needs of people.@@@That means a concerted effort must be made to address transnational challenges such as migration, organized crime and policies and patterns that are at the root of inequality and environmental degradation.@@@Solidarity, shared responsibility and respect for human rights must be our compass.@@@In Costa Rica. 11 per cent of our inhabitants are migrants.@@@We are the Latin American country with the greatest proportion of migrants in relation to its total population.@@@And according to data from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, we are the third country in the world in receiving asylum applications, reaching more than 270.000 as of September of this year.@@@But, as a middle-income country, our resources are limited and our current and emerging needs have been rendered invisible.@@@In that regard.@@@Costa Rica calls on the international community to take immediate action so that it can manage migratory flows in a safe and orderly manner.@@@We require financial support for the effective integration of those people into our social fabric.@@@Multilateral organizations and international financial institutions must recognize that middle- and upper-income countries cannot be excluded from international cooperation and a fair distribution of resources based on the countries’ needs.@@@My third call to action must be the reform of the international financial system.@@@The redesign of the international financial system must be aimed at peace, human security and sustainable development, beyond geopolitical reorganization.@@@And that change 
must occur in each and every international financial institution, including regional and global development banks, which must be aligned with that common goal.@@@This is nothing less than a systemic reform.@@@There can be no reform without a radical rethinking of the criteria for access to official development assistance, under which sustainability and peace would be given priority, alongside new mechanisms aimed at closing gaps and asymmetries.@@@We need countercyclical solutions to the systemic failure that forces us to choose between our human security and the payment of our debts.@@@We need more investment, more cooperation and more financing now, when we can still make transformative decisions and generate safety nets for those most affected.@@@Fourthly, we are running out of time to save our home.@@@We need to rethink our relationship with the planet.@@@Costa Rica is an example showing that it is possible to promote development while protecting the environment.@@@Its commitment to urgently addressing the interconnected environmental crises is beyond doubt.@@@That requires action, ambition and resolve to reach our 30x30 conservation goal of no more than 1.5°C of global warming.@@@We continue to lead the way in reversing deforestation through our protected areas programme and payments for environmental services programme, in which through new modalities, resources are made available and agreements are put in place under the reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation programme to recognize all of our 22 indigenous territories for their guardianship of our forests.@@@However, because of our geographic location in one of the regions most vulnerable to the impacts of extreme weather, we have focused on prevention and preparedness to ensure that natural disasters have the lowest human cost.@@@But their economic impact, in particular on infrastructure, continues to be devastating and disproportionately affects the poorest and most vulnerable, including rural and coastal communities.@@@That is why, for Costa Rica, resilience has always been a smart investment when it is based on prevention, preparedness and a rapid and inclusive response.@@@That must be our compass in renewing our relationship with the planet.@@@As a major ocean State, we also call for a wake-up on the health of the ocean and better governance.@@@The ocean is being affected by global warming, sea level rise, an alarming increase in marine pollution, the overexploitation of fish stocks, decreasing biodiversity and the loss of coral.@@@It is therefore a genuine honour to be the next co-hosts, along with France, of the United Nations Conference to Support the Implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 14: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development, to be held in June 2025 in Nice.@@@Costa Rica, for its part, will host a high-level event, on 7 and 8 June 2024, to increase our level of ambition and, above all, implementation and action for the ocean.@@@It will be a space for integration, in which countries and other stakeholders can share good practices and successful examples of conservation and sustainable use.@@@We are proud to be the second country to sign the agreement on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction.@@@We will continue to vehemently lead the application of a precautionary extension to the commencement of deep seabed mineral exploitation in international areas, pursuant to article 145 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.
Costa Rica is an example that dialogue can be more powerful than guns, that the criteria of inclusion and fair competition are stronger than the obsessive race driven by spurious and selfish criteria.@@@Our people have no fear from dissociating themselves from the principle that might makes right.@@@It is we who depend on the international system that understand the urgency of having a global system in place that meets the needs of the most vulnerable.@@@The proposals that Costa Rica has made seek to accelerate the decision-making process so that we can get out of the stupor that our Organization has fallen into.@@@We find ourselves at a turning point.@@@If ever there was a time for a call to action, it is now.@@@Permit me to extend my heartfelt congratulations to the President on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session.@@@My delegation and I stand unwaveringly by his side, committed to fortifying the bedrock of global unity during his tenure.@@@I offer my profound respect and gratitude to his predecessor.@@@Mr. Csaba Korosi of Hungary, whose deft stewardship of the seventy-seventh session is a guiding beacon for all.@@@The dedication of the Secretary-General.@@@Mr. Antonio Guterres, in weaving together the strands of global consensus in order to combat poverty and planetary crises and champion the Sustainable Development Goals is a testament to his leadership.@@@The soul of Sierra Leone, echoing the spirit of Pan-Africanism, resonates with the clarion call of this year’s theme to rebuild trust and reignite global solidarity.@@@A testament to our enduring democratic spirit was showcased on 24 June when, in free, fair and peaceful multi-tier elections, the Sierra Leonean people elected their leaders across various tiers of governance.@@@My re-election as President for a second and final term serves not merely as an endorsement of my leadership but also a solemn testament to my Government’s commitment to fashioning a Sierra Leone that thrives as a united, peaceful and dynamic bastion of hope and opportunity — a nation in which our aspirations for abundant jobs, food security, quality education and equitable health care are not mere dreams but manifest realities, and in which justice and opportunity are not the prerogatives of a few but the birth right of all.@@@In the face of global upheavals, from the pandemic to the geopolitical tensions exemplified by the war in Ukraine and the ensuing food crisis, my first term stood as a beacon of our commitment to democratic freedoms and human rights.@@@We rooted out the unpleasant legacies of the past, repealing antiquated laws such as the seditious libel statute that had lingered for half a century.@@@We consigned the death penalty to the annals of history and charted bold advances against the scourge of corruption.@@@Our devotion to education was unambiguous.@@@More than 800.000 new learners were introduced under our auspices, and we significantly augmented domestic educational funding, ensuring that it constituted an average of 22 per cent of our national budget.@@@We championed an ethos of radical inclusion, providing unfettered and tuition-free access to quality primary and secondary school education for all.@@@In our unwavering commitment to dismantling the barriers of gender inequality, my Administration declared a state of emergency for the heinous crimes of rape and sexual and gender-based violence.@@@Sierra Leone urged the global community for solidarity with respect to access to justice and remedies for the survivors of sexual violence and the recognition of 18 November by the General Assembly as the World Day for the Prevention of and Healing from Child Sexual Exploitation.@@@Abuse and Violence.@@@Our Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment Act of 2022 shows our commitment to equality.@@@With that Act.@@@I proudly inscribed our nation’s pledge to reserve a minimum of 30 per cent of seats in elected and appointed offices for women, while ensuring equal employment opportunities, lengthening maternity leave and compelling our financial institutions to chart pathways that strengthen women’s access to the financial resources that they rightfully deserve.@@@As I step into my second term, my Government has carved out five pillars that guide our national development trajectory to spur sustainable development and social progress.@@@First, food security, intertwined with investment in agriculture, is poised not just to feed our nation but to fuel job creation, propel economic growth and alleviate the weight of poverty.@@@Secondly, our human capital development is meticulously crafted for the modern era, with a special lens focused on gender equality.@@@Thirdly, our youth employment scheme promises our younger generation that their energy, passion and ambition will find fertile ground in Sierra Leone.@@@Fourthly, our cutting-edge technology and infrastructure programme was conceptualized to pave sustainable pathways of economic ascent.@@@Fifthly, a thorough revamp of our public service architecture refines its essence for the utmost efficiency, professionalism and service delivery.@@@Seventy-eight years ago, the United Nations was born of the profound understanding that peace, development and human rights are inextricably intertwined.@@@Each element nourishes the other, creating an equilibrium that is essential for global harmony.@@@As we stand at this juncture, let us remember the noble ambitions enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations — to foster international cooperation and confront and surmount challenges, be they economic, social, cultural or humanitarian in nature.@@@It is in unity and shared purpose that the promise of a brighter, just and peaceful world is realized.@@@The resonant theme of the current session of the General Assembly therefore opens a horizon of possibilities, beckoning us to harmoniously forge ahead in the shared pursuit of “accelerating action on the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals towards peace, prosperity, progress and enduring sustainability for all”.@@@Our world faces formidable challenges — widespread poverty, persistent hunger, the looming shadow of climate change and the unsettling presence of sustained and emerging conflicts.@@@To honour our 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development commitments, the States Members of the United Nations must rekindle the fires of trust and galvanize a renaissance of global solidarity.@@@Trust requires the harmonious amalgamation of our collective wisdom and resources.@@@Solidarity mandates our unwavering cohesion, even when navigating different or opposing philosophical terrains.@@@In pursuing the 2030 Agenda, we must resolve to leave no one behind.@@@We must fervently champion inclusivity, recognizing the intrinsic value of every individual, irrespective of their circumstances.@@@Progress has been made, but we acknowledge that the road ahead is challenging.@@@However, that challenge also presents an opportunity for innovation, collaboration and reimagining our global priorities.@@@On peace and security in the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) region, we view with deep concern the rising tides of insecurity and the subtle erosion of democratic governance and ideals in the West African subregion and the Sahel.@@@Sierra Leone raises its voice alongside our ECOWAS allies, expressing unequivocal dissent towards any extraconstitutional changes of Government.@@@Such challenges to the very bedrock of our democracy threaten the stability of individual nations and the fabric of our collective African identity.@@@While we stand united, it is not simply a call to maintain things as they are.@@@Real stability and lasting peace do not come from resisting threats or building defences.@@@Instead, they arise from genuine, open conversations.@@@True dialogue requires that everyone at the negotiating table be ready to seek and find common ground.@@@While we emphasize the importance of dialogue, we cannot ignore a crucial reality — the ongoing threats to our continent’s constitutional stability are signs of deeper problems.@@@Every action that undermines the rule of law is connected to underlying issues.@@@Those range from past and present injustices to the burdens of poverty and widespread unemployment and the dangers of discrimination.@@@Our duty is clear — we must lift our people from poverty.@@@We should focus on creating jobs and supporting industries that benefit our countries and our continent.@@@I would now like to talk about national electoral reform.@@@As vehicles of democratic transformation, elections fortify governance and enable peaceful transitions.@@@After our nation’s multi-tier elections on 24 June, we stand resolved to strengthen our democratic foundations.@@@Recognizing the significance of deepening our democracy.@@@I have instituted a National Electoral Systems Review Committee to address historical challenges in our electoral process.@@@Since our first multi-tier elections were conducted after the civil war ended in 2002, the electoral process has been plagued with persistent challenges, including contestations of declared presidential election results by the constitutionally mandated Electoral Commissioner.@@@To address those historical challenges and consolidate our democratic gains, a comprehensive review of the electoral system is necessary in order to reform Sierra Leone’s electoral landscape.@@@The National Electoral Systems Review Committee will comprise the Government, civil society, political parties, professional organizations and development partners.@@@It holds the mantle of evaluating existing frameworks, institutional arrangements and observer mission reports.@@@Its mandate extends to proposing vital reforms fortifying Sierra Leone’s electoral integrity.@@@Those actions encapsulate our commitment to forging a fertile environment for dialogue, affirming democratic governance and fostering enduring peace.@@@It is regrettable to note the decision of certain Member States to introduce unilateral coercive measures, including visa restrictions, on Sierra Leonean citizens following the recent multi-tier national elections.@@@We observe that such unilateral measures, which are in contravention of international law, have sometimes been the response to electoral outcomes in other African nations to exert political pressure.@@@As members of the international rules-based community.@@@African States strive for sovereignty and meaningful cooperation based on mutual respect and understanding.@@@In democratic processes, every democracy faces unique challenges.@@@However, the essence of sovereignty, as contained in the United Nations Charter, is the ability of Member States to address and resolve internal matters independently and without external pressure.@@@In our engagement on the international stage, we hope for understanding and mutual respect, especially on important issues like national elections.@@@Constructive dialogue and open channels of communication should be the pillars of our global interactions and not punitive unilateral coercive measures that do not further entrench democracy but instead strain relations between nations.@@@Sierra Leone remains steadfast in its commitment to free, fair and credible elections, alongside our dedication to the rule of law.@@@We believe that democratic progress is a journey and that its pace varies from one nation to another.@@@We respect the individual paths countries have taken in their quest for democracy and anticipate the same level of understanding and respect for ours.@@@We aspire to nurture relationships rooted in solidarity, cooperation and mutual respect, all directed towards a shared global future.@@@With regard to our Security Council tenure, as Sierra Leone takes its non-permanent seat on the Council for the 2024-2025 term, after a hiatus of 53 years, we are deeply aware of our shared duty to uphold international peace and security.@@@The profound nexus between peace, development and human rights will be the beacon guiding our priorities.@@@We stand poised, resolute and committed to forging a world where those ideals are not mere aspirations, but enduring realities for all.@@@Sierra Leone fully subscribes to the ideals of multilateralism as a tool for global peace and security.@@@Our vision is to serve as the vital conduit linking the ECOWAS community, the African Union and the nations under consideration with the Security Council.@@@As we yearn for tranquillity and justice, we pledge our commitment to collaborate with the five permanent 
members of the Security Council as one of the 10 elected members and three African representatives.@@@On Security Council reform.@@@Sierra Leone recognizes the pressing issue of the Security Council’s legitimacy, equitable representation and transparency.@@@In a world reshaped by geopolitical realities, true global peace and security hinge upon the reform and rejuvenation of the Security Council and the General Assembly.@@@Joined by fellow United Nations Member States.@@@Sierra Leone committed at the 2005 World Summit to support Security Council reform as an essential element of our overall effort to reform the United Nations in order to make it more broadly representative, efficient and transparent and thus to enhance further its effectiveness and the legitimacy and implementation of its decisions.@@@While the discourse has seen forward movement, the historical injustices endured by the African continent remain unresolved in the intergovernmental negotiations.@@@Africa glaringly stands alone as the only region without permanent representation within the Security Council and is conspicuously unrepresented in its non-permanent category.@@@The Security Council remains trapped in the era of 1945, when much of Africa was still in the regrettable grip of colonialism.@@@We must not allow this colonial ethos to persist three quarters of a century later.@@@Africa’s demand for two permanent seats — complete with commensurate rights, including the veto, if maintained — and five non-permanent seats are issues of equity, justice and our right to have an equal say in decision-making on issues that affect the African region.@@@Our conviction is steadfast.@@@Security Council reform should squarely confront this longstanding inequity and imbalance, addressing Africa’s unique circumstances.@@@As the Coordinator of the African Union Committee of Ten Heads of State and Government on the reform of the Security Council.@@@Sierra Leone will continue to advocate and garner support among Member States and other interest groups for the Common African Position, as enshrined in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration.@@@We will also engage in reviewing the working methods of the Council in order to instil transparency, accountability, democracy and, ultimately, renewed legitimacy.@@@With regard to climate change, our collective pursuit of sustainable development confronts the triple planetary crises of pollution, climate change and biodiversity loss.@@@Despite contributing minimally to these crises.@@@Sierra Leone remains intensely vulnerable to their repercussions, a reality compounded by our limited capacity to cope.@@@Our national adaptation plan, launched in 2018, stands as an embodiment of our commitment.@@@Designed to halve our vulnerability by 2030, it underscores risk awareness, regulatory enhancements, institutional empowerment and gender- responsive adaptation strategies.@@@Sierra Leone seeks equitable and timely access to climate financing.@@@We request unfettered access to leverage new climate change adaptation and mitigation technologies and shared knowledge.@@@Our salvation from the escalating climate change crisis lies in collective wisdom and concerted efforts.@@@With regard to global solidarity, in today’s complex world, the urgent need to rebuild trust and strengthen global unity stands out.@@@We must adopt a cooperative approach, set aside individualistic actions and promote shared progress based on common values.@@@As we deal with disputes of sovereignty and self-determination across the world, we must also resolve to do so through dialogue, exhausting all avenues for peaceful resolution.@@@In conclusion, in this evolving multipolar world, where conflicts ripple across borders and power dynamics are in flux, we must recognize our shared interests and intertwined destinies.@@@The multifaceted crises challenging our global community demand unified action, for our collective strength is determined by our most vulnerable segments.@@@The choices we make today have far-reaching implications for tomorrow.@@@We stand at a crossroads: one path leads to mere rhetorical commitments to equity and solidarity, while the other beckons us to act with conviction, driven by the profound belief in equity and justice — economic, social and political justice.@@@Let us choose wisely, for the fate of generations to come hinges on the decisions we make now.@@@It is an honour to address this gathering of States in the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session.@@@I stand before the Assembly to speak on behalf of a proud nation that is celebrating the leadership of the General Assembly for the next year by a son of the soil of Trinidad and Tobago.@@@We are proud of you.@@@Mr. President.@@@I once again extend my warm congratulations to you on behalf of the Government and the people of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago and assure you of our full support.@@@I would also like to express our deep gratitude to your predecessor.@@@His Excellency Mr. Csaba Korosi, for ably guiding our work during the seventy-seventh session.@@@Let me express our deepest condolences to the Governments and the peoples of Morocco and Libya and our solidarity with them in the wake of the recent tragedies in their countries, which have resulted in significant losses of lives and livelihoods and the destruction of property.@@@At the midpoint of the journey towards the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, sober reflection will leave many observers with a pessimistic feeling that the world is in peril and that we are at risk of significantly falling short in ensuring that no one is left behind.@@@We have seen an array of cascading crises in many parts of the world.@@@The Secretary-General recently sounded the alarm, saying that the period of global warming had ended and one of global boiling had arrived.@@@Investments in instruments of war have far surpassed investments in instruments of peace and peacebuilding.@@@Some protracted conflicts are continuing with little sign of a ceasefire, and others continue to erupt and escalate, with disturbing consequences.@@@All of that contributes to the waning spirit of multilateralism in our United Nations, the very purpose for which the Organization was built.@@@We have seen glimmers of hope extinguished by the darkness of despair, where the most vulnerable of the global population are made to pay the highest price.@@@The cards of the international financial system remain heavily stacked against the global South, inhibiting the prospects for those countries to achieve economic growth and sustainable development.@@@Against that backdrop.@@@I ask, is that the legacy that we want to leave to future generations?
Trinidad and Tobago, as a responsible member of our Organization, is committed to doing its part to achieve sustainable development and international peace and security for all.@@@However, our ability to safely navigate our destiny into the harbour of sustainable development by 2030 has been stymied by challenges and threats, some of which are existential.@@@One such threat is the proliferation and use in our society of illegal firearms, which, just as they do in other jurisdictions, bring untold suffering to many families and communities and the nation as a whole.@@@Only today we experienced the loss of five members of one family, killed by an assailant with an assault weapon.@@@The situation has worsened largely because of the accelerated commercial availability of such weapons, coupled with illegal trafficking from countries of manufacture into the almost defenceless territories of the Caribbean.@@@With a population of 1.4 million people.@@@Trinidad and Tobago experienced more than 600 murders last year.@@@90 per cent of which involved handguns or, increasingly, assault weapons.@@@Despite making our best efforts and huge inroads into our already scarce resources, we have already seen more than 400 violent firearms-driven killings this year.@@@This is a crisis shared by almost all the territories in the Caribbean and must be added to the challenges that stand in the way of successfully tackling any of the Sustainable Development Goals that have already been identified.@@@Trinidad and Tobago, both individually and as part of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), has attempted to devise solutions and interventions to address those challenges meaningfully and holistically.@@@For that reason, earlier this year we hosted a CARICOM Regional Symposium addressing crime and violence as a public health issue, as we felt it was incumbent on us to promote and encourage dialogue aimed at reducing violence and preventing crime in our society.@@@In that context, we are cognizant of the need for cooperation at all levels.@@@Accordingly.@@@Trinidad and Tobago remains fully committed to the Arms Trade Treaty and its stated objectives.@@@We also look forward to continuing to work collaboratively with our regional and international partners, especially the United States, to urgently reduce the illicit trade in illegal firearms, most of which are produced by gun manufacturers and promoters based here in this country.@@@We acknowledge and appreciate the recent and ongoing support of the United States in joining with Trinidad and Tobago and CARICOM more generally in confronting that metastasizing scourge, which is not only disturbing our safety but threatening our sense of security and even our democratic States themselves.@@@We acknowledge that the proliferation of violent crime, concomitant with other escalating crises, provides fertile conditions for destabilizing any country.@@@It is in that context that Trinidad and Tobago supports CARICOM’s position that all nations should respect the Caribbean Sea as a zone of peace.@@@Consequently, as we fight our own battle in this area, we remain deeply concerned about the developments in our fellow CARICOM country.@@@Haiti, that are having unimaginably terrible humanitarian, socioeconomic and security consequences.@@@We applaud the decision of the Government of Kenya to offer to help lead a multinational unit in Haiti and welcome the decision of the Governments of the Bahamas and Jamaica to contribute personnel to it.@@@Rwanda’s offer to help is also significant and commendable.@@@We urge the international community to collaborate with Haiti with a view to arriving at a credible solution to its current crisis that can guarantee that the country and its people are not left behind.@@@I would like to remind everyone of the exhortation by Trinidad and Tobago’s iconic calypsonian David Rudder in his timeless classic song “Haiti”, in which he says.@@@“Haiti.@@@I’m sorry”.@@@In his words.
“I refuse to believe that we good people / Will forever turn our hearts and eyes away / Haiti.@@@I’m sorry /@@@We misunderstood you /@@@One day we’ll turn our heads / And look inside you”.@@@That day has come.@@@That day is now.@@@We, the United Nations gathered here must prioritize authorizing the external help that Haiti desperately needs.@@@Just like anywhere else in the world.@@@Haiti deserves peace.@@@Haiti deserves prosperity.@@@Haiti deserves progress and Haiti deserves sustainability.@@@Haiti requires the intervention of the United Nations now.@@@I want to assure the Assembly that Trinidad and Tobago, as an honest broker, remains fully committed to working with the Government of Haiti and all other stakeholders to arrive at an indigenous solution that can comprehensively address the crisis in that country.@@@Trinidad and Tobago is of the view that in order to rebuild trust and reignite global solidarity, there must be universal adherence to the Charter of the United Nations and international law.@@@Respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States must be paramount and permanent.@@@It is in that connection that we continue to register our dismay and disappointment at the ongoing hostilities following the military action against Ukraine.@@@Although we are geographically far removed from the threat of the conflict, we are not unaffected.@@@It is indeed disappointing that the Black Sea Grain Initiative, which helped stabilize global food prices and potentially protected millions from the threat of famine and starvation, has been terminated.@@@We noted with great anxiety that global food prices rose in July for the first time in months.@@@That situation is of major concern to CARICOM as we acknowledge that food security remains a crucial issue for our region and is a vital component in our quest to implement the 2030 Agenda.@@@It is also regrettable that after all this time, a credible solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains elusive.@@@In that regard.@@@Trinidad and Tobago reiterates its strong support for a two-State solution based on mutual understanding, tolerance and respect, which would serve as a foundation for Israel and Palestine to live as peaceful, responsible neighbours.@@@We continue to urge both sides to recommit to a just, lasting and comprehensive solution that can ensure peace, prosperity, progress and sustainability for all.@@@The year 2023 marks two very important milestones for the international community, as we commemorate the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as well as the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Rome Statute.@@@As a country that has been a long-standing advocate for the International Criminal Court.@@@Trinidad and Tobago congratulates the Court on its achievement.@@@In recognizing that milestone, we want to remember and pay tribute to an outstanding pioneer of the Court, the late Arthur N. R. Robinson, former Prime Minister and President of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago.@@@We have seen sufficient evidence to be convinced that 
his efforts, which resulted in part in the creation of the International Criminal Court, were not in vain.@@@For that reason.@@@Trinidad and Tobago remains steadfast in its support to the work and mandate of the Court, as we believe that access to justice is a critical element in achieving sustainable peace.@@@We therefore continue to urge those countries that have not done so to submit to its jurisdiction so that it can comprehensively fulfil its mandate as a truly universal Court.@@@While we acknowledge that the International Criminal Court provides a beacon of hope for access to justice, we also recognize that it is an absolute injustice that 75 years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, discrimination and a lack of tolerance for fundamental human rights still exist.@@@We remain concerned about the fact that in some quarters, women and girls continue to be denied the kinds of opportunities that are offered to men and boys, which stymies our collective pursuit of building peaceful and sustainable societies.@@@It is quite paradoxical that we are attempting to implement the 2030 Agenda while leaving substantial segments of communities behind.@@@All of us must be allowed to live a life free of fear and free from all forms of violence, a life in which we are respected and our dignity and liberty are not compromised.@@@Those ideals must also shape the way forward for reconciliation, truth and justice.@@@The persistent underdevelopment of Caribbean nations and so many others is directly attributable to the unpaid debt created by centuries of enslavement and economic exploitation of Africans by Europeans.@@@The descendants of those people populate the Caribbean islands, where they struggle manfully against the residual rigours of those historic crimes, even as they are visited by the worst effects of climate change and a constant threat of exclusion from the world’s mainstream financial systems.@@@In that regard.@@@Trinidad and Tobago continues to call for bold and decisive action to ensure reparatory justice for the untold suffering of millions in the developing world, and we would welcome Africa’s support in that quest for justice.@@@It is undeniable that climate change is an existential threat to all of us and does not recognize geographic boundaries.@@@We also acknowledge that our people, the people of the small island developing States, those who are least culpable for the climate crisis, are the ones who continue to be most disproportionately affected.@@@The experts have told us that this past July was the hottest month on record and that global ocean temperatures also reached record levels.@@@Most disconcertingly, we have noted with justifiable alarm the recent dire warning from scientists that without ambitious climate action, we will exceed the critical 1.5°C temperature threshold.@@@However, recent developments have shown that overly ambitious net-zero targets should not be forced on small island nations.@@@We are called on to be game-changers on this issue.@@@We have a responsibility for the survival and continued existence of life on this planet that no other generation of leaders has had.@@@A global stocktaking at the twenty-eighth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change will be crucial, and it must produce a road map that brings the world closer to being on track by ensuring that nationally determined contributions are aligned with the 1.5°C goal.@@@Nationally determined contributions must become nationally implemented contributions.@@@Trinidad and Tobago is in the process of implementing its commitment to installing some infrastructure for supplying sustainable energy.@@@We urge developed countries to increase their support for the second replenishment of the Green Climate Fund.@@@If those commitments are honoured in full sooner rather than later, they will go a long way to rebuilding trust and reigniting global solidarity, particularly for the global South.@@@The global economic crisis has landed heavily on the developing world, with small island developing States such as Trinidad and Tobago and its Caribbean neighbours facing the harshest impacts of the socioeconomic fallout.@@@For that reason, the next 10- year programme of action will be crucial to ensuring that no one is left behind.@@@We call on the international community to lend its support to the fourth International Conference on Small Island Developing States, and to reach an ambitious and transformative global blueprint that will drive the sustainable-development ambitions of small island developing nations towards long-term, resilient prosperity.@@@We will also continue to advocate for sensitivity on the part of international financial institutions to the specific circumstances of developing countries and the challenges they face.@@@Trinidad and Tobago therefore reiterates its support for the development of a multidimensional vulnerability index, the Bridgetown Initiative and any other effort that addresses the most pressing needs of developing countries, including those encountering liquidity challenges and debt distress.@@@Earlier this year.@@@Trinidad and Tobago welcomed the landmark adoption of the Agreement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction.@@@Along with its CARICOM partners.@@@Trinidad and Tobago participated actively in the negotiations.@@@We are fully confident that when that treaty enters into force, the benefits will redound to all of humankind.@@@The 2030 Agenda envisions a revitalized global partnership for sustainable development, based on a spirit of strengthened global solidarity.@@@However, it will be impossible for our sisters and brothers in Cuba to achieve those goals if the anachronistic economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed on that country remains in place.@@@For more than six decades, the people of Cuba have been grappling with significantly diminished prospects for charting a course towards prosperity, meaningful progress and sustainable development.@@@Trinidad and Tobago therefore reiterates its call for the unconditional lifting of the economic, commercial and financial embargo on Cuba, and certainly for Cuba’s removal from any unjustified listing as an alleged State sponsor of terrorism.@@@Despite our challenges. 2023 has been a momentous year for us in CARICOM.@@@In addition to your election as President of the General Assembly.@@@Sir, in Port of Spain we recently celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the Caribbean Community under the theme “50 Years Strong: A Solid Foundation to Build On”.@@@It was indeed a confluence of celebratory events, as we all rejoiced over the election of CARICOM members to major United Nations bodies.@@@In that regard, we congratulate Guyana on its election as a non-permanent member of the Security Council, and Haiti and Suriname on their election to the Economic and Social Council.@@@Guided by our Charter and the spirit of multilateralism, there is a popular aphorism that we can use as inspiration.@@@“Coming together is the beginning; keeping together is progress; working together is success”.@@@If we can apply that maxim.@@@I have no doubt that we can achieve peace, prosperity, progress and sustainability for all.@@@Trinidad and Tobago will be doing its part.@@@We continue to stand on our principles, to deploy our diplomacy and leadership in the service of the common good, to uphold international law and to work with Member States in our commitment to leaving this world safer, healthier and better.@@@The world is undergoing a time of change.@@@A new era is dawning while humankind is still coping with the effects of a pandemic that killed 15 million people, exposing the inequality we face.@@@Meanwhile, the climate crisis is subjecting our planet to all kinds of inclement events.@@@Cyclones, tornadoes, unexpected floods or extensive droughts end up affecting millions of human beings in all latitudes of the planet.@@@All of this is happening while a war drags on, claiming more human lives and unleashing an energy and food crisis of tremendous proportions.@@@As all those calamities are unfolding, we are witnessing an astonishing technological revolution.@@@Robotization and the accelerated process of installation of artificial intelligence force us to rethink education, production processes and the preservation of work.@@@How to address changes and harmonize interests in this new scenario in which we find ourselves is the real challenge we face.@@@In speaking before this House.@@@I feel obliged to express myself with absolute candour.@@@The world’s problems demand solutions.@@@We have already spent a great deal of time diagnosing the problems.@@@We cannot keep talking about them while walking on a razor’s edge.@@@The risks of perpetuating that reality are very high.@@@We have gone halfway towards achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development knowing that, as the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean points out, perhaps only a quarter of the goals will be achieved that year.@@@That inability to envision a better future sows unease in a world that wants to develop and where the poorest and most vulnerable people on the planet live.@@@It is impossible to seek to achieve an equitable future by promoting the continuity of the same logic that has generated the inequality in which we live.@@@International financial engineering appears abusive and unchanging.@@@How can we achieve sustainable development without financing to help us do so?@@@The international financial system does not evince the will to adapt to a world that wants to recover lost equity.@@@On the contrary, it seeks only to impose the same orthodox policies that have deepened inequality and misery in the world.@@@The global financial architecture serves only to concentrate income in the very few and to marginalize vast regions of the world.@@@It puts its money in speculation rather than in development.@@@It promotes cheap labour rather than the dignity of work.@@@There is no longer time for words.@@@It is time to promote social justice in the world.@@@The International Monetary Fund cannot raise its interest rates every time the United States Federal Reserve raises its rates to contain inflation in that country.@@@It cannot do so, and yet it does.@@@In that context, it is shameful that to this very day it applies surcharges to many countries that are already finding it unbearable to carry the burden of external debt.@@@Ironically.@@@International Monetary Fund finances Ukraine in the middle of the war, and in the midst of that war it applies surcharges to the interest it charges.@@@That is just astounding.@@@We need a new framework for the treatment of sovereign debt that has development with social justice as its goal.@@@Experience shows that when a people is suffocated under the eternal sentence of debt, its strength wanes, social crises are intensified and debts become uncollectible.@@@We are facing the challenge of feeding a growing world population in critical climatic conditions.@@@Droughts or floods, tornadoes or hail — everything affects food production and supply.@@@We know that from our own experience.@@@Argentina lost more than 20 per cent of its total exports due to the worst drought in the past 100 years.@@@No less than three points of its gross domestic product were wiped out.@@@We also know today that an international food market intoxicated by financial speculation only facilitates greater income for a few and instability and misery for millions of human beings.@@@To find a long-term solution to the problem of food security, it is crucial that there be a fairer, more transparent, more equitable and more predictable international trade system for agricultural products.@@@We must eliminate the distortions produced by subsidies and prohibit food from being the subject of financial speculation.@@@Both discourage the investments needed to increase production to help meet growing global demand for food.@@@Argentina considers multilateralism to be the best tool to identify shared solutions to common problems.@@@It reflects our vocation to act in solidarity and to cooperate in the search for collective well-being.@@@Hegemonic proposals have served only to enhance mistrust, promote arms races and limit the possibilities of economic and scientific-technological cooperation.@@@In the current situation, as we know, the impact of more than a decade of accumulated crises have come together, ranging from the effects of the financial collapse of 2008 to the war unleashed by Russia’s occupation of Ukrainian territory.@@@The effects of that war are visible.@@@In addition to the terrible consequences in humanitarian terms, the armed dispute is generating historic levels of inflation on a global scale, with a special impact on the price of food and energy.@@@The current reality is also seeing the rise of tensions that are less addressed by public opinion, but that deeply affect international peace.@@@As an example.@@@I highlight Azerbaijan’s blockades in the Lachin corridor, which have been causing a humanitarian crisis that is once again punishing part of the Armenian people.@@@Precisely today, as this meeting is being held, the media are reporting that Azerbaijan has launched military operations with the purpose of taking control of Nagorno-Karabakh.@@@The international community cannot remain passive in the face of such a reality.@@@It must act preventively to avoid new ethnic, racial, religious or political persecutions.@@@As we have always done, we continue to demand that the parties find the sanity that calls them to peace and that the multilateral organizations recover the strength that they seem to have lost to enforce international rules.@@@The countries of the global South have historically shared many views on the international system and on the responsibility incumbent on multilateral organizations in matters of development, global peace and security, cooperation and decolonization.@@@I represent a country that this year is celebrating the fortieth anniversary of its recovery of democracy — a country that has learned from its historical past to say “never again” to human rights violations and that has promoted as a State policy the right to memory, truth and justice.@@@We are proud of these four decades of uninterrupted democracy, in which the promotion and protection of human rights have been a fundamental part of the path taken.@@@Today UNESCO declared the ESMA Museum and Site of Memory — a clandestine detention, torture and extermination centre where the dictatorship perpetrated its greatest atrocities — a World Heritage Site.@@@By actively preserving the memory that the deniers wish to hide, we will prevent that time of pain from being repeated.@@@Faced with those crimes against humanity, our solution was not revenge but justice.@@@Precisely, because we know the horror involved in the disappearance of 30.000 human beings.@@@I take this opportunity to reiterate the call for adherence to the International Convention for the Protection of all Persons against Forced Disappearances.@@@We need more committed States so that this crime is completely eradicated.@@@The challenge before us is to consolidate and advance the rights agenda, which means establishing democracies with greater equity and equality among its citizens.@@@Human rights are comprehensive and do not admit any type of regressivity.@@@If there is regression, the cultists of authoritarianism win and hate speech proliferates.@@@That is how democracies are delegitimized and the crisis of representation that is generated ends up putting the institutionality of the rule of law in check.@@@Preserving the rule of law is a shared conviction on our continent.@@@That is why we view current events in Guatemala with concern.@@@The international community must activate the relevant mechanisms that ensure respect for the popular choice.@@@The climate crisis is a reality that has modified temperatures and atmospheric phenomena around the world, imposing restrictions and obstacles to development.@@@It is imperative to resolve the problem without further delay by creating a fair, transparent and equitable multilateral environmental financing architecture, based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities.@@@Argentina reaffirms its commitment to gender equality and diversity as an essential condition for growth and sustainable development at the national and international levels, with a human rights approach.@@@We have developed regulatory frameworks and public policies to promote equality for all women and diversities.@@@Currently, our country is executing its National Plan for Equality in Diversity.@@@As part of the integrationist vocation embodied in the South American Common Market and the Union of South American Nations, over these four years we have proposed resuming a path of integration with Latin America and the Caribbean and strengthening dialogue with all our partners through political coordination, with a solidarity and cooperative approach.@@@As the construction of the European Union once was, the different integration bodies of Latin America and the Caribbean are a heritage that the region contributes to a humankind in search of peace, cooperation and justice.@@@Our region is facing a historic opportunity.@@@It has the energy and food that the world demands.@@@Our development depends on our having the ability to take advantage of those resources.@@@We must work together to carry out infrastructure works that allow us to compete industrially from our region.@@@Argentina condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.@@@Terrorist acts pose a threat to peace, international security and human dignity.@@@Terrorism must be combated within the framework of the rule of law and full respect for international law.@@@Argentina has ratified its commitment to the Inter-American Convention against Terrorism and to most international instruments on terrorism, seeking to develop all the measures contained therein as the most effective way to end this threat.@@@For our part, we continue to fight against impunity, investigating the attacks that we suffered in 1992, at the Israeli Embassy, and in 1994, at the AMIA headquarters, which claimed the lives of 107 people and left hundreds injured.@@@We want those responsible for such atrocious attacks to be identified, tried and convicted.@@@Once again, we urge the Islamic Republic of Iran to cooperate with the Argentine judicial authorities to advance the investigation of the attack on AMIA.@@@We also urge the international community to accompany us in our fight by refusing to receive or harbour any of the accused, even when they enjoy diplomatic immunity.@@@We must remember that international arrest requests and Interpol red alerts have been issued against them.@@@Argentina firmly opposes the use of unilateral coercive measures and the adoption of discriminatory trade practices.@@@The perpetuation of the blockade against Cuba is unacceptable.@@@Year after year, the General Assembly demands by an overwhelming majority the need to end the blockade.@@@Likewise, we request once again the exclusion of Cuba from the list of countries that allegedly sponsor international terrorism.@@@Similarly, the sanctions imposed by the United States on Venezuela must immediately cease.@@@Its extension over time only hurts the living conditions of its inhabitants and has led to exile for millions of Venezuelans who have left their homeland looking for a better life.@@@I also want to reaffirm the legitimate and imprescriptible rights of sovereignty of the Argentine Republic over the Malvinas Islands.@@@South Georgia, the South Sandwich Islands and the surrounding maritime area.@@@They form an integral part of the Argentine national territory and have been illegally occupied by the United Kingdom for almost two centuries.@@@In accordance with the resolutions of the General Assembly and its Special Committee on the Situation with Regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, the way to resolve the colonial situation of the Islands is through sovereignty negotiations between Argentina and the United Kingdom.@@@We regret that the United Kingdom continues to refuse to resume negotiations.@@@We question its ongoing unilateral activities of exploration and exploitation of natural resources in the disputed area, in violation of resolution 31/49, as well as its military presence in the South Atlantic, a zone of peace.@@@Argentina maintains a firm commitment to the peaceful resolution to that anachronistic colonial situation.@@@We have proposed to the United Kingdom a renewed bilateral agenda on the South Atlantic that involves a formal dialogue process that includes, of course, the issue linked to the resumption of negotiations on sovereignty.@@@We also express our willingness to pursue the tasks involved in the identification of former combatants killed in the Islands, within the framework of the obligations arising from international humanitarian law and in order to provide a response and comfort to the families.@@@Unfortunately, the United Kingdom has rejected our proposal.@@@Notwithstanding.@@@Argentina reiterates its request to the Secretary-General to redouble his efforts, within the framework of his good offices, to bring both parties closer to the negotiating table.@@@The motto of the 2030 Agenda is “Leave no one behind”.@@@May no one stray from the path of justice and development forever.@@@We are convinced that it is a noble objective that is valid for individuals and peoples alike.@@@But let us not turn it into a dead letter.@@@When that happens, repentance serves no use.@@@It does not repair damaged lives and lives without a future; much less does it restore lives lost.@@@In the firm conviction that democracy is the memory of the future, nine days ago.@@@Chile commemorated 50 years since the coup d’etat of 11 September 1973, an event that violently ripped apart our way of life, bringing death, persecution, pain and misery to my nation.@@@The images of the bombing of the presidential palace.@@@La Moneda, and the immolation of the constitutional president of Chile.@@@Salvador Allende, as well as the evidence that the United States Administration, under President Nixon at the time, had conspired from the outset to promote the failure of the Chilean Government, shocked the democratic conscience of the world.@@@While some countries were betting at that time on the destabilization of both fragile and more robust democracies, there were also multilateral organizations such as the United Nations that played a fundamental role in the defence of human rights and democracy.@@@From the outset, they were committed to defending those who were most vulnerable and suffering in Latin America, including in Chile and throughout the world.@@@For that reason, we owe the United Nations, as well as several of the countries present here, an enormous debt of infinite gratitude.@@@There were thousands who anonymously helped those persecuted and saved lives, demonstrating a solidarity with the victims of the dictatorship headed by Augusto Pinochet that still moves us to this day.@@@Since then, our country has come a long way.@@@As Chileans, we are proud to have been able to unite to recover democracy, restore the Republic and rebuild the 
path towards the expansion of the rights and fundamental freedoms conquered by the founders of our homeland.@@@Chile is a country that loves and promotes peace, and it is that characteristic of our identity that brings me to address the Assembly.@@@Fifty years after the tragedy I described, we have faced our pain head-on, confronting it with initiatives such as the Rettig Commission, the Valech Commission and now our national search plan.@@@Chile is a country that is making progress because we have learned lessons from our past, reliving it in order to be able to build a better future.@@@From the lessons we have learned, we are able to devote ourselves to the challenges of the present.@@@I would say that the main lesson learned — as I am sure most of us would agree, having listened to the preceding speakers — is that issues pertaining to democracy must always be resolved with more democracy, never less, and that a coup d’etat is never inevitable.@@@Democracy always offers alternatives.@@@We have also learned that human rights provide an inalienable ethical basis for political action, and that human rights have no political undertones and must be promoted and defended at all times and in all places.@@@All violations of human rights must be unequivocally condemned, regardless of the Government responsible.@@@That is a principle that we have upheld and will continue to uphold, especially as members of the Human Rights Council.@@@We have also learned through our history that democracy is fragile — it is not guaranteed forever — and therefore we must take care of it; violence is not acceptable as a form of political action in democracy; and dialogue between those who think differently must always prevail, which also applies to relations between countries.@@@That is why I wish to reaffirm Chile’s profound inclination towards multilateralism and mechanisms for the peaceful settlement of disputes.@@@We have also learned something I deem important to stress in times of polarization, namely, that when we manage to unite in the pursuit of common objectives, we can move forward pluralistically for the benefit of our peoples.@@@While it is true that, as anyone following the debate in our country can see, there is still great divergence in Chile, there is also great consensus.@@@That is how the five living former Presidents — one of whom is a woman — and myself came to sign a commitment to the future for democracy and human rights.@@@We also invited other State leaders to join us.@@@Even in the most critical political moments, we are capable of coming together.@@@Government and opposition, to find ways out of an impasse and to prioritize our people over our legitimate differences.@@@That is how together — and I underscore, together — as Government and opposition we are building the path towards being able to meet the demands of our people.@@@The generations that came before us took on the responsibility of making our nations independent; establishing democracies, fundamental freedoms and universal human rights; and progressively advancing in the conquest of social rights.@@@My generation — one that was not yet born at the time of the 1973 coup d’etat — has the no less difficult task of consolidating and defending many of those legacies, while at the same time facing new threats and challenges with optimism.@@@Today I wish to raise three urgent tasks to address that, in my homeland, we humbly believe coincide with much of what has been spoken about in this Hall today.@@@First, our most urgent task is to safeguard democracy.@@@We must stop the advance of intolerance and authoritarianism, and we must resolutely confront, in an institutional and uncomplicated manner, the disinformation that is corroding our democracies.@@@At the same time, we must defend the advances in the rights of minorities, as well as of those who are not a minority but the majority, such as women, whose advances and rights are threatened by sectarianism and fanaticism of various kinds.@@@We must address the root causes of the dissatisfaction that democracy generates, because we note with concern that the loss or fragility of democracy today may not be expressed in the coups d’etat of the twentieth century, but rather in new forms, some of which may even have the appearance of a majority.@@@Why is democracy today not satisfying the yearnings of peoples who urgently want and need greater security, greater equality and a way out of poverty?@@@Democracy must be able to deliver results — we must focus very strongly on that.@@@When institutions are slow to respond or fail to do so in a clear and timely manner, the challenges of corruption, organized crime and multiple inequalities corrode our institutions, and therefore the population ceases to trust them.@@@Therefore, caring for democracy means taking charge of the frustrations, desires and needs of citizens; channelling our resources to address the challenges of our time; moving forward with concrete actions for greater freedom, prosperity, social justice and sustainability; and always putting the collective interest 
ahead of individual ones, particularly the individual interests of those who have the most power — namely us, as leaders.@@@In that sense, we also defend unrestricted respect for human rights as a means of civilizational progress, regardless of the Government in power.@@@That is why I feel it is my duty, as we have stated in other international forums, to denounce before this Hall and the world the persecution that anyone who thinks differently from the Government under the dictatorial Ortega and Murillo regime in Nicaragua is currently experiencing.@@@In that country, not only are dissenters banned from taking part in elections, but they are persecuted and deprived of their nationality.@@@Their homes are raided and they are stripped of their political rights.@@@Meanwhile, we all need to recognize that any solution must be arrived at as a result of multilateral dialogue.@@@We must therefore state clearly that the imposition of unilateral sanctions does not contribute to a solution.@@@From our standpoint, the sanctions imposed against Venezuela today do not serve to improve the living conditions of the Venezuelan people.@@@We are convinced that the United States must lift the sanctions that it has imposed against Venezuela in order to ensure that free elections, with all the necessary safeguards for all segments of the population, can be held.@@@The same must be said of the sanctions that have been in place for so long against Cuba.@@@I want to be very clear: declaring that Cuba is a country that promotes terrorism is false, and we are angered by that.@@@We urge the United States to take the line of the Obama Administration, which removed Cuba from that list.@@@It has now been put back on that list three years in a row, and for all the years it has been on the list, it is not the Government of Cuba that has suffered but the Cuban people, who do not deserve it.@@@At the same time.@@@I feel obliged to speak out on two conflicts, from two different times, that are tearing humankind apart.@@@There are some present here who might legitimately wonder why Chile would discuss conflicts happening in countries so far from its own.@@@It is because we feel the pain of humankind as a whole and we should not remain silent when we see, for example, the illegal occupation of Palestine and the denial of the opportunity for a Palestinian Government to be formed.@@@There is a wall that divides its citizens.@@@We recognize the right to exist of both States.@@@Palestine and Israel, and that is why, from this rostrum, we call for respect for international law.@@@A more recent conflict in which we also see the ambiguities that tend to emerge when events of a geopolitical nature occur, and which we must clearly and explicitly condemn, is the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia.@@@On that point, we are convinced that the invading Government and the invaded people cannot share the same level of blame or responsibility for a conflict of that nature.@@@Peace can be achieved only guaranteeing respect for the territorial integrity of nations.@@@We say that as a small, or rather medium-sized, country from the South.@@@We know that countries such as ours have only international law on which to depend for our defence in potential future conflicts.@@@Today it is Ukraine; tomorrow it could be any one of us.@@@Knowing that, we cannot close our eyes.@@@Neither can we allow ourselves to be ambiguous in the condemnation of what, from our perspective, is an illegal war of aggression.@@@The second topic that requires urgent action, and for which we also do not share equal responsibility, is the crisis of climate change, pollution and biodiversity loss.@@@We are all aware of the analysis and its conclusions.@@@Almost all the leaders at this rostrum have spoken on the topic.@@@These are the problems of today, not tomorrow.@@@In my country, we have faced forest fires and floods.@@@We know that many States here, in particular the most vulnerable — those that have contributed the least to global warming and have burned the least fossil fuels — are the ones that have suffered the most from the climate crisis.@@@That is why we are making the same appeal that we made earlier this morning at the high-level panel on this topic.@@@We call for rapid action to accelerate the energy transition, change our consumption patterns and establish new rules and institutions that will allow us to meet those demands.@@@In our country, we have made progress in that direction under various leaders and Governments.@@@We have 43 per cent protected marine areas and 22 per cent protected land areas.@@@We have adopted a biodiversity protection law and have committed to reaching carbon neutral status by 2050 at the latest.@@@We hope to reach that milestone even earlier.@@@Climate change means that we face increasingly frequent and more complex challenges.@@@Right now, we are suffering from a very severe drought.@@@At the same time, there have been rains that led to the flooding of areas no longer used to life-giving water, as well as forest fires.@@@We are suffering a wide range of phenomena that have a direct impact on the most vulnerable.@@@We understand that the same problems are happening elsewhere in 
the world.@@@There were devastating floods recently in Libya, which the President and the Secretary-General both mentioned in their addresses yesterday.@@@There is what happened in Pakistan last year.@@@There was drought in Argentina.@@@Central America and the Horn of Africa.@@@Those are just a few examples that should move us to action now.@@@We need to do more.@@@I call in a responsible way on the countries with the most industrial activity to assume their full moral responsibility — not just to be more environmentally respectful but also to show greater solidarity with those who are suffering most, such as the small Pacific island nations and those of Oceania.@@@Central America and the Caribbean that are suffering the most devastating effects of climate change.@@@We are not responsible for the damage caused by the climate crisis or its biases.@@@Chile is putting all of its weight behind environmental agreements.@@@Among other agreements, last year we supported the Americas for the Protection of the Ocean coalition, and this year we signed the Agreement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas beyond National Jurisdiction.@@@I reiterate to the General Assembly our willingness and commitment to having Valparaiso, the historic gateway to America and the pearl of the Pacific, serve as the headquarters for the secretariat of the Agreement.@@@States can count on Chile for its proper development and contribution to a more sustainable, fairer and more equitable development.@@@I turn finally to the third challenge, which is related to technological change and can only be compared to the industrial revolution of the mid-eighteenth century.@@@It will drastically change how we relate to one another and our ways of thinking, producing and working.@@@Only a few days ago, a mother in a small town in Spain reported a group of young boys who used artificial intelligence to remove the clothing of their female classmates, harming their honour as well as their right to themselves, their integrity and their privacy.@@@All technological developments throughout the history of humankind have been a major opportunity to create fairer societies; however, if we get it wrong, they can also be the source of new injustices.@@@In that context, we are all obliged to create multilateral consensus and an ethical framework for the development and use of new technologies, such as artificial intelligence.@@@We need a framework that takes the human rights perspective into account in technological research and development, with a view to protecting and promoting the dignity and the rights of peoples and individuals, as well as sustainable development needs.@@@There is no doubt that societies must make progress, but we must do it in a responsible way.@@@That is why we must understand and better manage the opportunities offered by technologies for our benefit, before they become a threat and further entrench existing inequalities.@@@That is, for example, what we have been doing in Chile since we established the Congress on the Future, and I am certain that everyone here has similar initiatives in their own countries.@@@Humbly, but also proudly.@@@I can say that my country today serves as a Latin American benchmark for the future of artificial intelligence, and we will work tirelessly in that direction.@@@Democracy is memory and future.@@@That underlies our view that technological development must be a tool for unity, not division, and one that promotes the empowerment of all of society, addresses the phenomenon of disinformation, supports the most vulnerable sectors and does not further entrench inequalities at the national and global levels.@@@I wish to conclude by saying that the challenges we face require audacious and collective solutions, because none of us — not even the most powerful country in the world — can tackle those challenges in isolation.@@@The phenomena of the climate crisis, migration and pandemics have neither borders nor flags.@@@Because they affect all countries of the world, this forum, the General Assembly, must rise to the challenge and honour the calls made yesterday by the Secretary-General.@@@Mr. Antonio Guterres, with respect to reforming global governance in terms of its political and financial aspects.@@@It is either reform or a descent into barbarism.@@@We are for reform, and we can say to the Secretary-General that he has our support in reforming not only the Security Council but also the financial institutions that were born out of the Bretton Woods consensus.@@@I underscore that democracy is memory and future, and the role of the General Assembly will be decisive on the path to a better world.@@@Because we have learned from our past, and in my capacity as a representative of new generations.@@@I am optimistic about what is to come in our future, because throughout its more than 70 years of history the General Assembly has shown that, even in the most difficult moments, it is possible for humankind to strike agreements on the path towards civilized cooperation and coexistence.@@@States will always be able to count on Chile to promote and to 
defend human rights, multilateralism and democracy, and to build together a sustainable future and a world free of poverty with greater social equality.@@@As we meet here this evening, millions of people in Morocco and Libya continue to struggle with the aftermath of a devastating earthquake and catastrophic flood.@@@Let me extend the sympathy of the British people to all those who have lost loved ones.@@@Our search-and-rescue teams have been deployed in Morocco, and we have increased our humanitarian support for Libya.@@@We will continue our support, alongside many other nations represented here, in the weeks and months to come.@@@This week, nations have gathered here to recommit to addressing the biggest challenges we face: climate change, with catastrophic weather events telling us to act now; the Sustainable Development Goals and how to get them back on track after the coronavirus disease; migration, with millions crossing borders and dangerous seas, at the mercy of human traffickers; and Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine.@@@The latter was an attack on a sovereign Member of the United Nations by a permanent member of the Security Council — the most heinous assault imaginable on everything that the Organization stands for and was founded to prevent, with consequences felt, not just by the brave people of Ukraine, but by millions across the globe.@@@Those hit by food shortages, particularly in developing countries, are Putin’s victims too.@@@Russia could end this war tomorrow.@@@Putin could end this war tomorrow.@@@That is what the world demands.@@@But until that happens, the United Kingdom will stand alongside Ukraine.@@@It will do whatever it takes for weeks, for months or, if necessary, for years, because if the United Nations, in which the United Kingdom believes and helped to found, is to count for anything it is surely for the cardinal principle that aggression cannot and must not pay.@@@Those are the issues of the moment.@@@But I want to focus on another challenge, a challenge that is already with us today and that is changing right now all of our tomorrows.@@@It is going to change everything we do — education, business, health care, defence and the way we live.@@@And it is going to change Government and relations among nations fundamentally.@@@It is going to change the United Nations fundamentally.@@@Artificial intelligence (AI) is the biggest transformation the world has known.@@@Our task as Governments is to understand it, grasp it and seek to govern it, and we must do so at speed.@@@Think how much has changed in a few short months, and then think how different the world will look in five years’ or ten years’ time.@@@We are fast becoming familiar with the AI of today, but we need to prepare for the AI of tomorrow.@@@At this frontier, we need to accept that we simply do not know the bounds of possibilities.@@@We are as Edison was before the light came on or as Tim Berners-Lee was before the first email was sent.@@@They could not surely have respectively envisaged the illumination of the New York skyline at night or the wonders of the modern Internet, but they suspected the transformative power of their inventions.@@@Frontier AI, with the capacity to process the entirety of human knowledge in seconds, has the potential not just to transform our lives, but to reimagine our understanding of science.@@@If, like me.@@@Member States believe that humans are on the path to decoding the mysteries of the smallest particles or the farthest reaches of our universe, if Member States think that the Millennium Prize Problems are ultimately solvable or that we will eventually fully understand viruses, then Member States will surely agree that, by adding to the sum total of our intelligence at potentially dizzying scales, frontier AI will unlock at least some of those answers on an expedited timetable in our lifetimes.@@@Because in AI time, years are days, even hours.@@@The frontier is not as far away as we might assume.@@@That brings with it great opportunities.@@@The AI models being developed today could deliver the energy efficiency needed to beat climate change, stimulate the crop yields required to feed the world, detect signs of chronic diseases or pandemics and better manage supply chains so everyone has access to the materials and goods they need and enhance productivity in both businesses and Governments.@@@In fact, every single challenge discussed at this year’s General Assembly and more could be improved or even solved by AI
Perhaps the most exciting thing is that AI can be a democratizing tool open to everyone.@@@Just as we have seen digital adoption sweep across the developing world.@@@AI has the potential to empower millions of people in every part of our planet, giving everyone, wherever they are, the ability to be part of this revolution.@@@AI can and should be a tool for all.@@@Yet any technology that can be used by all can also be used for ill.@@@We have already seen the dangers AI can pose: teens hacking individuals’ bank details, terrorists targeting Government systems, cybercriminals duping voters with deepfakes and bots, even States suppressing their peoples.@@@But our focus on the risks has to include the potential of agentic frontier AI, which at once surpasses our collective intelligence and defies our understanding.@@@Indeed, many argue that the technology is like no other in the sense that its creators themselves do not even know how it works.@@@They cannot explain why it does what it does, and they cannot predict what it will or will not do.@@@The principal risks of frontier AI will therefore come from misuse, misadventure or misalignment with human objectives.@@@Our efforts need to pre-empt those possibilities and to come together to agree a shared understanding of those risks.@@@That is what the Al summit that the United Kingdom is hosting in November will seek to achieve.@@@Despite the entreaties we saw from some experts earlier in the year.@@@I do not believe we can hold back the tide.@@@There is no future in which that technology does not develop at an extraordinary pace.@@@And although I applaud leading companies’ efforts to put safety at the heart of their development and their voluntary commitments that provide guardrails against unsafe deployment, the starting gun has been fired on a globally competitive race in which individual companies, as well as countries, will strive to push the boundaries as far and fast as possible.@@@Indeed, the stated aim of those companies is to build superintelligence.@@@AI that strives to surpass intelligence in every possible way.@@@Some people working on that think it is just a few years away.@@@The question for Governments is how we respond to that.@@@The speed and scale demand that leaders be clear- eyed about the implications and potential.@@@We cannot afford to become trapped in debates about whether AI is a tool for good or a tool for ill; it will be a tool for both.@@@We must prepare for both and insure against the latter.@@@The international community must devote its response equally to the opportunities and the risks and do so with both vigour and enthusiasm.@@@In the past, leaders have responded to scientific and technological developments with retrospective regulation.@@@But in this instance the necessary guardrails, regulation and governance must be developed in a parallel process with the technological progress.@@@Yet, at the moment, global regulation is falling behind current advances.@@@Lawmakers must draw in everyone — developers, experts and academics — to understand in advance the sort of opportunities and risks that might be presented.@@@We must be frontier Governments alongside frontier innovators.@@@The United Kingdom is determined to be in the vanguard, working with like-minded allies in the United Nations and through the Group of Seven’s Hiroshima AI Process, the Global Partnership on AI and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.@@@Our country is uniquely placed.@@@We have the frontier technology companies; we have world-leading universities; and we have some of the highest investment in generative artificial intelligence (AI).@@@And, of course, we have the heritage of the Industrial Revolution and the computing revolution.@@@This hinterland gives us the grounding to make AI a success and make it safe.@@@They are two sides of the same coin, and our Prime Minister has put AI safety at the forefront of his ambitions.@@@We recognize that while, of course, every nation will want to protect its own interests and strategic advantage, the most important actions we will take will be international.@@@In fact, because tech companies and non-State actors often have country-sized influence and prominence in AI, that challenge requires a new form of multilateralism — because it is only by working together that we will make AI safe for everyone.@@@Our first ever AI summit, in November, will kick-start that process, with a focus on frontier technology.@@@In particular, we want to look at the most serious possible risks, such as the potential to undermine biosecurity or increase the ability of people to carry out cyberattacks, as well as the danger of losing control of the machines themselves.@@@For those that say that those warnings are sensationalist or belong to the realm of science-fiction.@@@I simply point to the words of hundreds of AI developers, experts and academics, who have said: “[m]itigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks, such as pandemics and nuclear war.”@@@I do not stand here this evening claiming to be an expert on AI, but I do believe that policymakers and Governments ignore this expert consensus at the peril of all of our citizens.@@@Our summit will aim to reach a common understanding of those most extreme risks and how the world should confront them and, at the same time, focus on how safe AI can be used for public good.@@@The speed of its progress demands that this cannot be a one-off or even an annual gathering.@@@New breakthroughs are happening daily, and we will need to convene more regularly.@@@Moreover, it is essential that we bring Governments together with the best academics and researchers to be able to evaluate technologies.@@@Technology companies must not mark their own homework, just as Governments and citizens must have confidence that risks are being properly mitigated.@@@Indeed, a large part of this work should be about ensuring faith in the system, and it is only nation States that can provide reassurance that the most significant national security concerns have been allayed.@@@That is why I am so proud that the United Kingdom’s world-leading Frontier AI Taskforce has brought together pioneering experts like Yoshua Bengio and Paul Christiano, with the head of the Government Communications Headquarters and our national security advisers.@@@It is the first body of its kind in the world that is developing the capacity to conduct the safe external red-teaming that will be critical to building confidence in frontier models.@@@And our ambition is for the Taskforce to evolve to become a permanent institutional structure, with an international offer.@@@Building that capacity in liberal, democratic countries is important.@@@Many world-beating technologies were developed in nations where expression flows openly and ideas are exchanged freely.@@@A culture of rules and transparency is essential to creativity and innovation, and it is just as essential to making Al safe.@@@That is the task that confronts us.@@@It is — in its speed, scale and potential — unlike anything we or our predecessors have known before.@@@It is exciting, daunting and inexorable.@@@So we must work, alongside its pioneers, to understand it, to govern it, to harness its potential and to contain its risks.@@@We will have to be pioneers too.@@@We may not know where the risks lie, how we might contain them or even the forums in which we must determine them.@@@What we do know, however, is that the most powerful action will come when nations work together.@@@The AI revolution will be a bracing test for the multilateral system, to show that it can work together on a question that will define the fate of humankind.@@@Our future, humankind’s future and our entire planet’s future depends on our ability to do so.@@@That is our challenge, and this is our opportunity to be, truly, the United Nations.@@@Our debate is being held under the theme of restoring trust and reviving global solidarity.@@@President Dennis Francis has rightly called on us to accelerate action to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals for peace, prosperity, progress and sustainability for all.@@@He has called on us to rebuild international peace and security, to show leadership in the fight against climate change, and to support efforts to promote and ensure the full enjoyment of human rights by all.@@@His priorities are also our priorities.@@@We can sign off on them immediately.@@@To respond to global threats, from Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine to climate change, from poverty to pandemics, we must act.@@@We cannot remain idle.@@@We must act together, as truly united nations.@@@It is important to ask ourselves: What does it mean to be united?@@@I have a feeling that each of us has her or his own definition of what it means to be united these days.@@@First, it means being able to count on each other.@@@There are larger and smaller nations, and some are there to support the others.@@@My country is not the largest in size but has always believed that unity and the willingness to work with others have made it bigger and stronger.@@@We are a founding Member of the United Nations, the European Union.@@@NATO, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the Council of Europe.@@@My country has always believed in the international order and the resolve to come together to build something together.@@@As Europeans, we commit daily to defending the principles anchored in the Charter of the United Nations and to strengthening multilateralism.@@@While many people believe that the solution to today’s problems is to build walls and cut ties.@@@I am among those who are convinced that it is the readiness to build bridges that is the right solution.@@@I wish to speak of Luxembourg’s assistance for sustainable development.@@@The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Summit, held a few days ago, reminded us of the urgent need to redouble our efforts if we want to achieve the SDGs by 2030.@@@We have seen the devastating effects of the coronavirus disease pandemic and Russia’s war against Ukraine lead to a deterioration of poverty indicators in many developing countries.@@@Luxembourg is determined to continue to show solidarity.@@@For several years, we have devoted 1 per cent of our gross national income to public development assistance.@@@Our support focuses on the least developed countries and basic social sectors.@@@We have seen how, in many European countries, one of the first budget items to be cut when a new administration takes power is cooperation.@@@It is true that it is not very popular to offer to help people at the far side of the world when some populists point to the problems at home.@@@But the problems we have at home are rich people’s problems in most other countries of the world and their own problems are issues of survival, while ours can occasionally be overlooked.@@@Luxembourg had the honour of preparing, with South Africa, the High-Level Dialogue on Financing for Development, which was held on 20 September.@@@The Dialogue made it possible to identify avenues for closing the SDG financing gap.@@@In partnership with international financial institutions and the private sector, the aim is to mobilize the resources that developing countries need to get out of debt and ensure financing of the SDGs.@@@Our climate action is also not very popular these days, because it is never popular when we act to change people’s daily lives.@@@People do not like it when we say that things must change, but we will be judged by future generations if we do not shoulder our responsibilities today.@@@While we may need to take unpopular decisions, we must do so if we wish to preserve the quality of life we enjoy today.@@@There are those who do not believe in climate change, and I have heard politicians express doubt about climate change from this very rostrum.@@@I do not know how it is in other countries, but in ours we have had tornadoes, floods and other unprecedented phenomena.@@@Events on the far side of the world that we used to see on television are now happening at home.@@@That is nothing compared to the situation being experienced by Heads of State and Government who have spoken here and do not know if their countries 
will be able to resist or even exist in the long term.@@@It is hard to imagine being a citizen of a country that could disappear under the melting icebergs.@@@Let us think of that.@@@What would you build for the future?@@@How could you fight that phenomenon?@@@Luxembourg shares the Secretary-General’s commitment to solving the climate crisis.@@@I was fortunate enough to be present when we reached the Paris Agreement on Climate Change in 2015.@@@We must pursue that course.@@@We will support negotiations at the twenty-eighth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to establish the new Loss and Damage Fund to help developing countries that are particularly vulnerable.@@@We are also strengthening our international climate finance, which is in addition to our official development assistance.@@@My Government has just decided to increase Luxembourg’s contribution to the Green Climate Fund by 25 per cent for the period 2024-2027.@@@We also work in close cooperation with the European Investment Bank in the field of sustainable finance.@@@Luxembourg’s financial centre, in particular our Luxembourg Green Exchange, has issued the first green bonds and mobilized private capital.@@@In our Embassy only yesterday, we hosted colleagues from Cape Verde and Rwanda, and we were able to show that we can bring the private and public sectors together if we want to succeed.@@@As public authorities, we cannot do it alone.@@@If we want to succeed, we must be ready to bring in the private sector.@@@Those who have not done so are very welcome to visit Luxembourg to see how the private and public sectors can come together and move forward.@@@I have just listened to the speaker before me talk about human rights.@@@I am sure that if we asked all the representatives here today what human rights mean to each of them, we would find to our shame that in 2023 human rights still depend on where you are born.@@@They depend on your religion.@@@They depend on whether you are a girl or boy.@@@They depend on your sexual orientation.@@@It is still a shame to know that today, in 2023, human rights are different from one person to another depending on their place of birth.@@@And it is not only about human rights.@@@It is also about civil rights, economic rights, the right to education, the right to be different, the right of diversity, the rights of women, the right to choose for yourself rather than for someone else who thinks he knows better what is good for you to do so.@@@That is the reality still in 2023, when we speak about universal human rights and when we speak about the United Nations.@@@No, we are not united when we speak about human rights.@@@The definition of human rights still depends today on where you were born, and I can affirm that that is not our best achievement.@@@And still we celebrate the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.@@@For us, the defence of the human rights of women and children will stay a priority.@@@We are also proud to have supported the initiative to create an institution for people who have disappeared in Syria.@@@We have to fight intolerance, and I would ask everyone just to be intolerant to intolerance.@@@Is it still normal that nowadays, some political parties try to explain, for example, that the Second World War was not such a terrible period?@@@One need only go to Auschwitz and see what happened there, where millions of Jewish people were killed.@@@They were killed because they were Jewish.@@@They were gypsies.@@@They were gay or they were left-wing.@@@If you go there you will see thousands and thousands of suitcases.@@@You will see crutches.@@@You will see hair.@@@You will see glasses.@@@And people were just a number.@@@That was what happened on my continent and still today some people think that this is just a small part of our history.@@@\
I thought we would have learned from the past when I see what also happened after the Second World War.@@@When we see today that being gay, being lesbian or being trans is still a death penalty.@@@I myself am gay; it is not my choice.@@@I did not wake up this morning to ask myself why I am gay.@@@The most difficult part was to accept myself.@@@People must realize that being gay is not a choice.@@@But being a homophobic is a choice, and we have to fight against people who do not accept diversity in our nations.@@@I could go on citing all the different epithets about religions, about antisemitism and anti-difference.@@@When we speak about being in the United Nations and wanting to share values together, we still have to also play a role in international peace and security.@@@When I see the situation in Africa.@@@I have to say that I am not reassured about what has happened.@@@I take a special moment to think about my colleague.@@@President Bazoum.@@@As President of the Niger, his was one of the stable countries.@@@He is now in custody.@@@I want to inform the Assembly that for us it was also important 
to support the African countries that condemned the coup.@@@It is not about the power of the strongest, of the one who has the weapons, who has to win against the supporters of democracy.@@@We have to continue to fight for this.@@@Is it normal that our procedures in the United Nations make it possible for a permanent member of the Security Council to block consideration of situations when we have all agreed that there is a problem?@@@Last year.@@@I sent a message to the Russian delegation, asking its members to listen to us and to try to stop that unnecessary war.@@@I am among the few leaders who has had calls with President Zelenskyy and with President Putin.@@@I was criticized for having made those calls, but I do not regret them.@@@If we want to find solutions, we need to speak to one another.@@@But when I realized that there was no will on the Russian side to find solutions or to save lives.@@@I gave up.@@@So again.@@@I say to the Russian delegation: There is no reason to kill innocent civilians, to rape women and to kill children.@@@I grew up in peace.@@@I have never lived through war, but on my continent we had a war in the former Yugoslavia not that long ago.@@@And if I am free before the Assembly, it is because other countries supported Luxembourg.@@@There is an American military cemetery for thousands of young guys and girls who did not even know where my country was, and yet they died for me to be able to sit in a free country today.@@@And that is the reason why we will not leave Ukraine alone.@@@Ukraine has no choice, and we cannot accept that it is in the power of your biggest neighbour to decide what is good for you.@@@I have seen it in my own lifetime, when Germany thought that it knew what was better for Luxembourg than we did.@@@And so we will continue to support Ukraine.@@@We will not leave it alone and we need to make the Russians understand that they have made the wrong decisions.@@@We also need to sue.@@@We cannot accept that crimes have been committed and will not be punished.@@@This is the eighth time that I have been able to deliver a speech before the General Assembly.@@@I have been Prime Minister now for 10 years, since 2013, and I am proud of our contributions and the work my country has done in the United Nations during this period.@@@We were an active member of the Security Council in 2013 and 2014, and during that powerful experience we also proposed ourselves for another candidacy for the Security Council for the term 2031-2032.@@@In 2013, we also decided to be a candidate for the Council of Human Rights, and we were elected in October 2021 for the 2022-2024 mandate.@@@In October 2022, we also presented our candidature for the UNESCO Executive Board for the period 2025-2029.@@@We have done all this not just to be a candidate or to sit in a room.@@@We want to have added value when we put our candidature forward.@@@Also, we want to continue to fight for what I said earlier.@@@We want to continue being United Nations, for what it means to be united, and if we have differences we want to respect them and at least to convince, to exchange and to move on to become nations that are more united than we have been before, with young people and civil society.@@@We should also really think about our procedures.@@@Usually, when we follow our procedures everything is okay, but we have come to see that when we have troubles with a permanent member, it is difficult to move on.@@@We also have to give a voice to the African countries today in those institutions.@@@To conclude, when our nations are truly united, as I said earlier, wherever you were born, whatever your parents did, whatever religions they follow, whatever your sexual orientations and political orientations, you will be able to have the same right to live, to be educated and to be as you are and not like other people would love you to be.@@@The world as we know it is enduring profound and rapid transformations under the impact of the many challenges that humankind must face.@@@At the same time, against that very difficult background, we continue to defend our core values, the Charter of the United Nations and effective multilateralism.@@@Our decisions are critical for the future of humankind.@@@We, the leaders, are called upon now to take decisive actions for the generations to come, in a spirit of solidarity and shared responsibility, and to stand up for the rules-based international order and full respect for international law.@@@Romania is a direct neighbour to the continued war of aggression of Russia against Ukraine.@@@And we have acted, with all our energy, to make a solid contribution to regional and international security and stability.@@@That war has demonstrated that the Black Sea needs more global attention, as it is of strategic importance for transatlantic security.@@@Romania also stands for more efficient multilateralism, alongside like-minded partners across the globe, in the fight for freedom and democracy.@@@From day one of the war.@@@Romania has acted in full solidarity with the brave Ukrainian people.@@@We will continue to provide safe haven and to protect refugees coming from our neighbour, as we have done for the more than 6 million Ukrainians who have already crossed our borders.@@@We fully support the Ukrainian peace formula as the most suitable framework conducive to a fair, lasting and sustainable peace.@@@We also support the pursuit of international law and accountability, so that all those responsible for atrocities are brought to justice.@@@Our region, the wider Black Sea area, must be protected against the effects of Russia’s war against Ukraine and its hybrid war and malign interference.@@@Romania has consistently argued that it is necessary to keep the so-called protracted or frozen conflicts in the region high on our agenda.@@@Romania has also been at the forefront of supporting, in a multidimensional manner, the vulnerable partners in the region.@@@We have therefore offered substantial support to our neighbour the Republic of Moldova, the country most affected by the war — after, of course.@@@Ukraine itself.@@@While we work in the present to defend our values, we should also continue to project a sustainable future.@@@We therefore continue to actively pursue the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@Food insecurity and energy and economic instability affect the entire world, especially the most vulnerable in the global South.@@@By terminating the Black Sea Grain Initiative and attacking Ukrainian ports.@@@Russia is further exacerbating the global food crisis.@@@We once again urge the Russian Federation to cease blocking the Initiative.@@@As a direct neighbour to Ukraine and a responsible and solidary international actor.@@@Romania has played an active role in global food security efforts.@@@Since the beginning of the war, we have facilitated the delivery of more than 25 million tons of Ukrainian grain.@@@Romania will not let down our most vulnerable partners who need our support, especially those from the least developed countries, including from Africa.@@@We are also investing in, and making a contribution to.@@@African institutional resilience, peacekeeping and capacity-building.@@@Through our sustainable development strategy, we are advancing efficient, transparent and citizen-centred governance.@@@Our second voluntary national review, which was issued this July, is proof that we are on the right track, as we have already achieved 62 per cent of our national targets for 2030.@@@However, as we are keenly aware that we are lagging behind globally, we place our trust in the upcoming Sustainable Development Goals Summit and the Summit of the Future.@@@We are also aware of the importance of financing for development.@@@Romania is committed to increasing its official development assistance to 0.33 per cent of its gross national product by 2030.@@@Moreover, we will contribute to the European Union’s objective of allocating 0.20 per cent of its collective official development aid to least developed countries.@@@The devastating effects of climate change, pollution, biodiversity loss, energy insecurity and disinformation are our global concerns.@@@Romania’s efforts to combat those challenges are visible.@@@For instance, we are committed to the swift ratification and implementation of the Agreement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas beyond National Jurisdiction.@@@We were also part of the core group promoting the General Assembly’s request for an advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on the obligations of States in respect of climate change.@@@We remain vocal in supporting climate education — a priority for Romania and for me personally.@@@I also strongly believe that the climate-security nexus should be featured more prominently on the United Nations agenda, including at the Security Council.@@@We hope that the Climate Ambition Summit and the twenty-eighth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change will mobilize the political will to keep the 1.5°C target alive.@@@We must accelerate a just energy transition and emissions reduction, while also ensuring energy security.@@@Countering natural disaster risks also requires joint efforts, and the Emergency Platform initiative is a step in the right direction.@@@Romania actively participates in international assistance missions, shares best practices and offers training on response measures.@@@In our endeavours, we should use the opportunities created by digitalization, innovation and new technologies, as well as strategic investments in renewables, as enablers of sustainable development.@@@At the same time.@@@Romania welcomes the Secretary-General’s initiative to issue a code of conduct on information integrity on digital platforms.@@@In the current geopolitical context, the key to efficient multilateralism is ensuring its successful reform, which cannot be delayed any longer.@@@An enlarged Security Council could include important additional voices from the Group of African States, from various small island developing States and even from the smallest regional group — the Group of Eastern European States.@@@As we celebrate the seventy-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.@@@Romania strongly advocates for the strengthening of the United Nations human rights system, including for its adequate funding.@@@As a member of the Human Rights 
Council, we remain an active supporter of democracy, the rule of law, non-discrimination, the freedom of expression and children’s and women’s rights.@@@At the same time, full respect for, and the promotion of, international law remain at the very core of our foreign policy.@@@As an example.@@@Romania is advocating for an enlarged acceptance by States of the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice, and we count on members’ support for our solid candidature for the world Court.@@@Next year’s Summit of the Future represents an excellent opportunity to find joint global solutions.@@@The pact for the future must provide the United Nations with the tools to deliver, for us and for future generations.@@@We must stand for our people and for the future we want.@@@It is my particular honour to address the General Assembly.@@@I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the President on being elected to his position and to wish him every success in his work during these challenging times.@@@The world in which we live today requires joint, global and concerted efforts as the key to success in addressing serious global crises.@@@We strongly believe that we must strengthen the multilateral system based on international law.@@@We must make sure that it is effective and fair and able to endure and deliver results that will serve to achieve our common goals and commitments, as well as a better future for our planet and peoples.@@@We need to safeguard the role of the United Nations as the centre of global cooperation.@@@We are also hopeful that genuine efforts will be invested in the reform of the Security Council, as our main instrument for securing global peace and security.@@@In 2015, we adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development based on the consensus that, in order to transform our world, we need to realize that sustainable development cannot be realized without peace and security, and that peace and security will be at risk without sustainable development.@@@In 2023, at the mid-point in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, the assessments of the Global Sustainable Development Report show that the efforts to achieve that synergy have proved insufficient to date.@@@Time to reinvigorate our political commitments to the full and efficient implementation of the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is irreversibly running out.@@@In the meantime, the necessary boost came with the Secretary-General’s vision offered in Our Common Agenda (A/75/982) as an overarching road map for fighting the multiple crises.@@@The preparatory process for next year’s Summit of the Future — along with its outcome, the Pact for the Future — represents a unique opportunity to strengthen national and international governance and to make it more sustainable and resilient to future crises and shocks, thereby safeguarding the planet for future generations.@@@The international financial system is increasingly unable to adequately and efficiently respond to the challenges at hand.@@@More needs to be done to update and upgrade the global financial infrastructure so that 
it becomes more adapted to the needs of the world.@@@Most notably, we need to scale up development and climate financing.@@@In that regard, we support the efforts by the international financial institutions to review their structures and operating processes with a view to reform in order to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century.@@@Peace is not maintained by itself.@@@Investment in conflict prevention is far more cost-effective than investing in conflict resolution and post-conflict recovery.@@@That is why conflict prevention and sustaining peace should be at the centre of the framework of the New Agenda for Peace, intertwined with a renewed commitment to multilateralism, global solidarity and trust.@@@Croatia, as Chair of the Peace-building Commission (PBC) for 2023, strongly advocates for the strengthening and enlarging of both its geographical and thematic scope.@@@We support the Secretary-General’s call for the universality of conflict prevention and sustaining peace.@@@The PBC should also work more closely with international financial institutions and regional actors, forming a sustainable peace network.@@@In addition to its advisory powers, the PBC could also be vested with decision-making powers, enabling it to establish United Nations civilian missions upon request by the countries concerned and thereby helping to address the root causes of instability.@@@In that regard, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals can be an excellent prevention tool by fostering prosperity and inclusion, while leaving the world a safer place for future generations.@@@According to The Global Sustainable Development Report 2023.@@@Croatia’s performance in implementing the Sustainable Development Goals was among the top-ranked countries.@@@However, we still have a lot of work ahead of us.@@@Croatia has a large natural heritage that it wants to preserve for future generations through the implementation of the SDGs.@@@While accepting the clean energy transition.@@@Croatia is taking a number of measures to alleviate the transition shock due to the rejection of fossil fuels and to ensure a fair transition and prevent energy poverty.@@@With regard to biodiversity.@@@Croatia is committed to working jointly for the development and full implementation of the ambitious and transformational Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework.@@@Furthermore, we firmly believe that the protection, restoration and sustainable use of biodiversity is essential for the prevention of pandemics and the promotion of the One Health Approach, which needs to be included in future prevention plans.@@@We are also committed to working together to intensify cooperation in protecting the marine environment and combating plastic pollution.@@@If we want healthy oceans and seas, our ambition needs to be high and ocean protection needs to be stepped up significantly.@@@Croatia welcomes the landmark adoption of the Agreement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas beyond National Jurisdiction.@@@The successful negotiation of that agreement is the most recent proof of devoted multilateral work and represents not only a milestone in conserving the marine biodiversity of nearly two thirds of the world’s oceans but also a triumph for multilateralism.@@@Today Croatia proudly joined the first tier of countries that have signed the high seas treaty and is committed to ratifying it as soon as possible.@@@We call on other countries to do the same in order to enable its swift entry into force and the commencement of its effective implementation.@@@As a State member of the European Union.@@@Croatia has already committed itself politically and legally to contributing to making Europe the first climate-neutral continent by 2050.@@@By further pursuing that course and accelerating the development of renewables and increasing green investments, we believe that we can turn the current crisis into a new chance for our economies.@@@In that regard.@@@I would mention as an example one such project that can boost new growth in the European economy based on decarbonization and clean industry.@@@It is the North Adriatic Hydrogen Valley project, which encompasses Slovenia.@@@Croatia and the Italian region of Friuli-Venezia Giulia.@@@When we put the clean energy transition at the heart of the fight against climate change on the global level, we should not forget that the most vulnerable communities, which have historically contributed the least to climate change, are often the ones most and worst affected — both by climate conditions and by the costs of the green energy transition as a remedy.@@@The establishment at the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP27) of a loss and damage fund to help vulnerable countries cope with the destructive effects of climate change marked a historic breakthrough in that respect.@@@How we go about addressing the issue at the Climate Ambition Summit and COP28 will be a true test of trust and solidarity among nations and will have an impact on current and future generations.@@@Creating a world of peace and security that respects human rights and promotes social progress is the very foundation of the United Nations.@@@The number of human rights violations and humanitarian crises around the world shows that more must be done to prevent atrocities and operationalize the responsibility to protect.@@@Croatia is honoured to be contributing to that cause by serving as co-Chair, along with Costa Rica and Botswana, of the Group of Friends of the Responsibility to Protect in New York.@@@The Croatian Government remains committed to determining the fate of 1.806 persons who went missing during our homeland war in the 1990s.@@@Based on that tragic national experience, we continue to give our unwavering support to all efforts to provide answers to people still suffering the anguish of uncertainty anywhere in the world.@@@We remain committed to combating hate speech, advancing the rights of women and children, protecting minorities and abolishing the death penalty.@@@Gender equality is the foundation of a peaceful, prosperous and sustainable world.@@@In that regard, we want to highlight the importance of education and equal opportunities for girls and boys.@@@We will continue advocating against discrimination and hate speech, including antisemitism.@@@Croatia continues to attach the utmost importance to the welfare of its immediate neighbourhood in South- Eastern Europe.@@@We must fully tackle issues relating to the past and the legacy of war, such as resolving the remaining missing-persons cases, engaging in meaningful cooperation in handling war crimes without discrimination and in line with international standards, ensuring access to archives, and other unresolved and highly sensitive problems.@@@We actively support the European perspective of our close neighbour Bosnia and Herzegovina and warmly welcomed the recent European Union (EU) decision to grant Bosnia and Herzegovina the status of an EU candidate country.@@@We continue to advocate for electoral reforms that can ensure the legitimate representation of all its constituent peoples — particularly Bosniaks.@@@Croats and Serbs — at all levels of Government, which in our view is essential to the country’s future stability and prosperity.@@@We are very concerned about the latest developments in relations between Kosovo and Serbia and would like to encourage measures to de-escalate tensions.@@@And those two countries need to focus on normalizing relations, delivering on their commitments and starting to implement what was agreed on this year in Brussels and Ohrid.@@@We continue to advocate for universal recognition of the Republic of Kosovo and its right to existence as an equal member of the community of nations.@@@It is in our interests to promote the stability and further development of the region, in addition to the process of European integration, which we believe remains crucial to the future prosperity of our neighbours and which we hope will be accelerated in the coming years.@@@This year the World Health Organization declared that the coronavirus disease pandemic is no longer a global health emergency.@@@Recovery is well under way.@@@Unfortunately, the starting line was not the same for all of us across different regions.@@@This year’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Summit once again raised the alarm about the slow pace of SDG implementation, and I commend the Secretary-General for the sharp focus he is bringing to that issue.@@@Developing countries are constrained by a debt crisis, including higher costs 
of borrowing.@@@That is causing economic disparities to widen and slowing down our collective progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@The primary cause of this crisis is high interest rates in developed economies in order to correct for years of quantitative easing.@@@At the same time, developing countries face exaggerated currency and political risk premiums that are simply unjustified.@@@We need serious cooperation to address this issue.@@@In developing countries, we also have a responsibility to be accountable for the quality of our financial governance and the management of our natural resources.@@@Increasing access to finance also requires reform of our global financial institutions.@@@In that regard, we welcome the proposals of the Bridgetown Initiative, as well as the Paris Summit for a New Global Financing Pact.@@@Rwanda also supports the second replenishment of the Green Climate Fund to create the fiscal space for vulnerable nations to tackle climate change.@@@Africa and small island developing States, many of which are represented in the Commonwealth, want to work with partners and be part of the solution.@@@That is an important outcome of the recent Africa Climate Summit, held in Nairobi under the leadership of President William Ruto.@@@However, we must not only cool down our climate, but we must also cool down our conflicts.@@@Today there is no sign of ongoing conflicts ending anytime soon.@@@We do not even see hope, from those with the most influence, that an end is in sight.@@@Innocent lives are left alone to carry the burden of this instability.@@@That is a profound injustice.@@@The migration crisis is a case in point.@@@Every year, migrants and refugees undertake dangerous journeys in search of a better future.@@@Rwanda remains committed to working with partners, including the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, to contribute to a durable solution.@@@That decision is informed by our experience, knowing first-hand the pain of losing everything and not having a place to call home.@@@That is part of our promise to leave no one behind.@@@We continue to need a more effective forum to manage global crises.@@@That is why the United Nations was created in the first place.@@@However, that does not absolve any country or region of the responsibility to address the governance shortfalls that are the root causes of instability.@@@In that regard.@@@I welcome the Secretary-General’s report on a New Agenda for Peace.@@@Bilateral interventions, to which Rwanda contributes actively in various places, can provide a rapid response to a crisis situation.@@@But to have lasting effect, they need to pave the way for multilateral engagement and internal political progress.@@@No matter the number of troops deployed, the mindset should be to get results that serve the interests of the people on the ground.@@@Paying lip service to peace and getting lost in the process and formalities serve only to confirm the selective attention of some in the international community.@@@We still have a long way to go.@@@Africa urgently needs to be fully represented in entities where decisions concerning our future are made.@@@Just as urgently.@@@Africa must be fully prepared to speak with one voice.@@@Ultimately, a more effective development cooperation framework must give equal weight to everyone’s needs and priorities.@@@That is what builds fair and equal partnerships and a more just and peaceful world.@@@That is what we all claim to want, even as we too frequently fall short.@@@In that spirit, allow me to commend the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), led by Achim Steiner, for the Timbuktoo initiative to strengthen the African start-up innovation ecosystem.@@@This week, the International Telecommunication Union, led by Doreen Bogdan-Martin, together with UNDP, unveiled a major new initiative on inclusive digital public infrastructure.@@@Rwanda is very happy to be associated with those efforts, which reflect the United Nations at its best.@@@For Rwanda, the source of our solidarity comes from our commitment to never allowing a repetition of the tragedy that was inflicted on us nearly 30 years ago.@@@We continue to remain grateful to all those who have accompanied us on our journey as we plan to commemorate the genocide against the Tutsi for the thirtieth time in April 2024.@@@In conclusion.@@@I look forward to welcoming leaders to the third United Nations Conference on Landlocked Developing Countries, which Rwanda will host in June 2024.@@@Since the first time I came to the General Assembly (see A/74/ PV.7).@@@I have reminded members of the need to renew and reinvent ourselves.@@@I am referring not only to the Organization or the General Assembly, but to all countries, especially those in circumstances similar to ours.@@@Nor have I said it just to say it, but because I believe it and because in my country we are doing just that.@@@El Salvador, like many developing countries, has always dreamed of being great.@@@For some countries, that dream, at some point, seemed possible.@@@For others, like us, it was unthinkable.@@@We did not think it was possible to even get close to fulfilling it.@@@I even believe that no person listening to this speech ever thought that he or she could pronounce or hear the name of El Salvador as a global reference or example of something positive.@@@Despite all the obstacles, however, we decided to take the risk.@@@We did not accept the destiny that others had outlined for us.@@@Today, four years after our Government took power, no one can or dare deny that, for the first time in its 202 years of history, the smallest country on the American continent has taken the first big steps to achieve its dream of greatness.@@@In a very short time.@@@El Salvador has gone from being the world capital of homicides, from being literally the most dangerous country in the world, to being the safest country in Latin America.@@@It is no longer a promise.@@@It is a reality that Salvadorans are experiencing and that any foreigner can go and see for him or herself.@@@For that reason, many in the world are paying attention to what is happening in our country.@@@Especially in Latin America, but also in the United States and elsewhere, they see what is happening in El Salvador and wonder why it does not happen in their countries.@@@The answer is clear and simple.@@@They must make their own decisions and reaffirm their right to use common sense, to test their own recipes, to execute their own plans and to design their own systems.@@@No country has the right to impose its ideas or its way of doing things, especially when those do not even work in our countries.@@@In each of the decisions we have made, we have reaffirmed our legitimate right to govern ourselves, even if that meant making mistakes.@@@But we were not wrong.@@@We were successful — resoundingly successful.@@@We therefore reaffirm not only our right to make our own decisions, but also our right to be right.@@@There is no single recipe or formula that works equally for everyone, but I think that there is an ingredient that all recipes should include, or at least have the right to include.@@@That ingredient is courage.@@@You have to have the attitude, courage and determination to do what needs to be done, even when others question or criticize you.@@@For decades, we tried everything that others said was best for us.@@@They made us fight a civil war for a cause foreign to our reality, because they brought the conflict between the West and the Soviet Union to our land.@@@More than 85.000 dead and a country destroyed later, they told us that this was no longer the recipe — that now there was a new one.@@@So we signed some false peace agreements, which had nothing to do with peace and served only to allow the two sides that fought the war to divvy up the country, as if it were loot.@@@We tried every formula they gave us, and nothing worked.@@@Then, protected by foreign Powers, we handed the country over to the right.@@@And then, also protected by external agents, we gave power to the left.@@@This is the state they kept us in for 30 post-war years, during which there were more deaths, more poverty and more violence than in the civil war.@@@Nobody did a thing to change the root of the system or the institutions, much less the laws.@@@Everything that happened during those years was done with the support, consent and imposition of those who have always called themselves great defenders of human rights and democratic institutions.@@@Instead of giving us medicine to heal, they gave us poison.@@@They wanted us to continue doing the same thing that was done in the past.@@@They wanted the same people who had looted and massacred us to continue ruling or at least sharing power.@@@But this time, we told them no.@@@We rejected their poison and decided to try, for the first time, our own medicine.@@@Thank God, it worked.@@@The first thing we did was make sure we were on the side of God and the people, because no worthwhile transformation can happen by obeying external Powers.@@@Secondly, we created our own method — one that was designed for our reality, created by those of us who live that reality first-hand.@@@Then, the Salvadoran people gave us two votes of confidence.@@@Actually, they have given us several, but those are perhaps the two most important so far.@@@The first was when they elected me to be their President; the second, when they decided to give us, through the legislative body, the right to govern.@@@We knew then that we had an obligation to the people to make the decisions that were necessary to fix our most urgent problem, insecurity.@@@The efforts we made to improve health or the economy would be of little use if they continued killing people and the judges and prosecutors let the murderers go free.@@@It would be of little use to transform education if, from the same prisons, the gangs gave cowardly orders to kill our children and forcibly recruit our youth.@@@We could not just invest millions of dollars in building and improving road infrastructure if Salvadorans could not walk freely in the streets.@@@So we made the decision to purge the public ministry, the judicial system and the prison system.@@@Additionally, we changed the laws to ensure that terrorists would not be released from prison again.@@@It was at that moment that international condemnations began.@@@Some countries, some media and some experts began a systematic attack against each of the decisions we made.@@@People who never used their power and influence to demand security for our murdered people were suddenly opposed to our decisions to stop that massacre.@@@Countries that never condemned the murder of 30. 40 and even 50 Salvadorans a day suddenly demanded explanations from us as to why we changed the prosecutor, the magistrates and the judges.@@@Is it not absurd that they questioned us about that?@@@Who bears the responsibility for internal security policy in any country in the world?@@@It is the responsibility of the executive branch, which acts through the State security forces and the penitentiary system, in cooperation with the public ministry and the judiciary.@@@It was an essential condition for the plan to work that everyone worked together and aligned themselves on the same side.@@@If we had left the Attorney General, the magistrates of the Constitutional Chamber and the judges who many protected and against whom others even issued sentences when we removed them, we would still be the world capital of murders.@@@If we had listened to them, we would have continued to lose thousands and thousands of Salvadorans at the hands of terrorists.@@@Thank God we did not pay attention to them.@@@Each of the decisions we have made brought us to this moment.@@@Today El Salvador competes with Canada for being the safest country on the continent.@@@Not only are we the country in Latin America with the fewest homicides per capita by far, but we have reduced all crimes to a minimum.@@@People can now walk on streets that were long declared off-limits by the gangs.@@@Businesses no longer pay extortion money and children can now go out and play in parks without fear of being recruited or killed.@@@Those are things that will sound basic or everyday to many here, but in my country they did not exist.@@@They criticized and condemned us for each of the decisions we made at that time.@@@Intellectuals, journalists, politicians and organizations from all over were engaged in a debate about what we were doing.@@@Today I am here to say that debate is over.@@@The decisions we made were correct.@@@We are no longer the world capital of death, and we achieved that in a very short time.@@@Today we are a security benchmark, and no one can question that.@@@The results are in.@@@They are irrefutable.@@@In El Salvador, we did what was right for El Salvador.@@@Now that we enjoy this level of security, we have been able to open our country to the entire world.@@@This year alone, we welcomed thousands of athletes to the Central American and Caribbean Games.@@@We are the world epicentre of surfing.@@@We have just signed an agreement with Google to digitize the State and services such as education and health.@@@We have more and more tourism, internal and external.@@@More and more people want to come and meet us and invest in El Salvador.@@@Many Salvadorans abroad who spent years without being able to return due to insecurity are now investing in the country or have plans to return.@@@According to a study carried out in 2022 by the International Organization for Migration, from these very United Nations, more than 60 per cent of the many Salvadorans residing in the United States intend to return to El Salvador.@@@There is still a long way to go to achieve it, but we are on the way to achieving our goal of reversing the mass exodus of Salvadorans, a product of the wrong policies of the past and the civil war, and to fulfilling our dream of achieving reverse migration.@@@Let more Salvadorans return to El Salvador than leave.@@@United Nations studies are already predicting it.@@@In a few months, we will host Miss Universe, an event that will once again put us in the eyes of the world and attract more tourism and more investment.@@@In addition to all that, we are building more and better relationships with allied countries that want to support us in building our country and our dream.@@@I am not just saying this to brag, although I do feel proud of everything we have accomplished.@@@I am saying it because it is an example of what all countries can achieve when they begin to assert their sovereignty.@@@Look at us.@@@From being recognized for violence, today we are recognized for our landscapes, for our waves and, above all, for our bravery.@@@Today the world can see our full potential.@@@We have a country full of wonders to offer.@@@Those who visit us can have breakfast on the beach and surf world-class waves in a sea that has perfect water temperatures all year round.@@@They can have lunch in the mountains, where they can try the best coffee in the world, with our superb volcanoes and beautiful lakes as a background, and dine in the capital, with all the modernity, comfort and, now, security that many first-world cities would like to have.@@@And they can do all that in the same day.@@@But the best thing they will find is our friendly, hardworking people, who are always looking to do something new.@@@When you decide to visit our country, you will realize that we Salvadorans are proud to be Salvadorans.@@@That was not the case a few years ago.@@@El Salvador is being reborn, because we dared to challenge ourselves and decided that nothing and no one would tell us what to do.@@@We are still a long way from where we want to be, but we will continue to work hard and make our own decisions, so that we can achieve the greatness we long for.@@@We believe that the entire world also needs to be reborn, but that will be the decision of each nation.@@@We in El Salvador are setting the example and marking a path in case someone else wants to follow it.@@@The world that I see today is full of pain and mistrust, mysticism, cynicism and apathy.@@@There are interconnected, complex crises that have been created by our own self-centred ambitions.@@@Growing geopolitical rivalry is contributing to escalating tensions around the world, rather than leveraging multilateral determination to overcome the many crises that threaten us.@@@We are now living in an unpredictable world.@@@We must act to survive these interesting times.@@@Our collective effort is necessary to address the enormous challenges and reduce the risk associated with the unpredictable environment that we face today, not only as sovereign nations, but as the whole of humankind.@@@Instead of leveraging global cooperation to manage our shared challenges and associated risk, growing geopolitical rivalry is escalating those tensions.@@@Our Blue Pacific is at the centre of geopolitical tensions.@@@At the end of the Second World War, peace finally returned to the Pacific, but today we are facing renewed geopolitical competition with a similar but complex build-up.@@@For the Pacific, climate change has been identified as a threat to peace, security and our very existence.@@@The reality is that no country is exempt from the impact of climate change and no national can address it alone.@@@As we mobilize to address the impacts and associated challenges, we must at the same time come together to share our common wealth.@@@That is the only way we can ensure that no one is left behind.@@@We in the Pacific directly bear the brunt of climate change on our coastlines, our communities, our livelihoods, our security and, indeed, our very statehood and identity.@@@In addition, small island developing States are struggling to respond to global supply shocks, with soaring debt levels impacting progress in the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).@@@The inequality gap continues to widen.@@@This year marks the mid-point review of the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@Earlier this week, the outcome of the SDG Summit issued a call to action.@@@That was a rallying call.@@@The targets of the SDGs are now in danger.@@@That demands bold, ambitious and accelerated actions.@@@In that regard.@@@Fiji is committed to and will continue to support the Secretary-General’s report Our Common Agenda (A/75/982) in the acceleration of the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@We commend and fully support the initiative of the Secretary-General in convening the Summit of the Future next year.@@@It will be a pivotal opportunity to leverage global cooperation and address critical challenges in the lead-up to 2030.@@@In our commitment to achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, we presented our second voluntary national review on the Sustainable Development Goals in July.@@@It is clear from the review that this is a watershed moment.@@@We have only seven years left.@@@That underscores the need to forge stronger and robust partnerships to respond to the call to action.@@@The coronavirus disease pandemic conflated the impacts of recent natural disasters and worsened the burden on all sectors of the Fijian economy.@@@We experienced a significant economic downturn as tourism, the backbone of our economy, came to a virtual standstill.@@@Our economy is now on the recovery path, led by the tourism sector, which has rebounded to pre-pandemic levels.@@@Our challenges are interconnected.@@@They must be addressed with integrated responses through effective multilateralism.@@@International cooperation and solidarity are essential to protecting our collective interests through targeted engagement.@@@Peace and security are fundamental to sustainable development.@@@Fiji will continue to uphold global peace and security, as we have done for the past four and a half decades.@@@I am proud to be standing here, having commanded two of our peacekeeping battalions.@@@Currently, our peacekeepers are participating in six United Nations missions, contributing to the search for peace.@@@We are committed to the Secretary-General’s New Agenda for Peace, which outlines a vision for multilateral efforts based on international law for a world in transition.@@@The New Agenda for Peace echoes and is consistent with the Boe Declaration on Regional Security, issued by Pacific Forum leaders, which declared the Pacific to be a region of peace.@@@That concept of peace is the premise for our future.@@@I believe that it is time that we consider the Pacific as a zone of peace.@@@We have had discussions on the concept at the regional level and I am convinced that it will be the Blue Pacific’s contribution to world order — the zone of peace.@@@The Blue Pacific is the world’s largest ocean.@@@It is also an important carbon sink.@@@Therefore, it is important for humankind that it be protected and sustainably managed.@@@The large ocean States of the Pacific are guided by the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent in navigating challenges and leveraging collective efforts to create a prosperous and sustainable future for our peoples.@@@This year marks the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.@@@It is also my seventy-fifth year of life.@@@We are committed to our obligation to implement human rights covenants and conventions emanating from the Universal Declaration.@@@I am also pleased to confirm that the Government I lead is committed to implementing the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and International Labour Organization Convention 169, on the rights of tribal and indigenous peoples.@@@We join the international community in affirming the implementation of indigenous peoples’ rights and aspirations.@@@The Climate Ambition Summit, held earlier this week, called for enhanced commitment to climate action.@@@We must commit not only to reducing emissions, but also to supporting vulnerable communities and fostering climate resilience.@@@We look forward to the twenty-eighth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and in particular to the finalization of the Loss and Damage Fund modalities.@@@We remain hopeful that the pledges towards the $100 billion climate finance goal will be met this year.@@@Climate finance is inaccessible, in particular for small island developing States.@@@There is therefore an urgent need for reform of the global financial architecture if future targets are to be met.@@@Fiji welcomes the announcement by President Biden earlier this week of his commitment to contributing $11 billion a year to international climate finance to help lower-income countries implement their climate goals.@@@I also commend United States leadership in the reform 
of the World Bank, which is geared towards helping low- and middle-income countries to access finance.@@@Whilst the mid-term review of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 recognizes some progress in implementation, there is room for improvement in the pace of implementation.@@@In Fiji, we continue to strengthen our disaster risk reduction approach by building resilient infrastructure, strengthening early warning systems, enhancing community preparedness, improving disaster response capacities and promoting ecosystem-based approaches.@@@Fiji will continue to deploy humanitarian and disaster relief and rehabilitation to its neighbouring countries, including for bushfires, severe tropical cyclones, earthquakes and tsunamis.@@@We are also undertaking climate mobility adaptation strategies.@@@As of today, we have relocated 6 coastal communities out of the 42 communities that have been identified for urgent resettlement and relocation.@@@As a party to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.@@@Fiji continues to recognize the significance of ocean conservation and its sustainable use and management.@@@Earlier this week.@@@I joined other leaders in signing the agreement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction, with the intention of ratifying it as soon as practicable.@@@I am pleased to report that Fiji will ratify the World Trade Organization Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies, after its endorsement by the Fiji Parliament last week.@@@To combat plastic pollution.@@@Fiji is actively engaged in negotiations for the new treaty.@@@We urge countries to finalize the treaty by 2024, before it is too late.@@@For small island developing States, the triple burden of non-communicable diseases, mental health and the climate emergency are straining our health infrastructure and resources.@@@Health financing, infrastructure, supply chain management for medicines, consumables and medical equipment, workforce retention and deployment, and development are critical to Fiji and other small island developing States.@@@The World Health Organization (WHO) Voluntary Health Trust Fund for SIDS, established this year, will address the technical capacity-building needs of SIDS.@@@We encourage development partners to contribute to the Fund.@@@Fiji also supports the overarching WHO accord for pandemic prevention that is currently being negotiated.@@@Equity must be at the centre of our global health responses.@@@We welcome the progress made thus far on the multidimensional vulnerability index to support access to credit through concessional financing and debt relief.@@@Achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will require a new framework for development finance institutions that is responsive and relevant to addressing the needs of small island developing States.@@@The people of Fiji, on whose behalf I address the Assembly, have given me the responsibility to lead our large ocean State.@@@I cannot fail them.@@@We need genuine and durable partnerships that ensure our collective security, that ensure our ability to facilitate economic prosperity, and that ensure that we safeguard our resources.@@@It is time to tell it as it is.@@@It is time to be bold, to be blunt and to do what is necessary for our very survival.@@@We want a future where global solidarity and the collective well-being of humankind are the ultimate objective.@@@In the midst of the multifaceted crises that threaten our very existence, it becomes vital to demonstrate our resolve and the untapped reserves of courage and resilience within our innermost selves.@@@We all hold the power to be a catalyst for the change that we need.@@@I believe that, together, we can.@@@I congratulate President Francis on his election.@@@As a fellow islander, he is well acquainted with the challenges common to all small island developing States (SIDS), from economic resilience and climate change to financing and security.@@@We all look forward to working with him over the next year to meet those challenges.@@@We thank Secretary-General Guterres again for his tireless efforts and advocacy for a more secure, prosperous and sustainable world, which is our ultimate goal and what brings us together today.@@@The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is a universal call to action.@@@As a small island developing State.@@@Palau faces economic challenges related to our small population.@@@We are vulnerable to climate change.@@@We struggle with the high cost of imported foods and goods, face infrastructure challenges due to our remote location.@@@Those shared issues highlight the unique challenges faced by SIDS in our pursuit of sustainable development and a better life for our people.@@@Like other SIDS.@@@Palau is working to build a diverse and resilient economy.@@@We are looking to the digital world, which relies not on land mass but on our determination to succeed.@@@That new perspective is borne out of a harsh lesson learned when the punches started coming about seven years ago.@@@In 2016.@@@Palau’s economy, heavily reliant on tourism, had a significant downturn.@@@In one year, we lost 13 per cent of our tourism.@@@By 2019, the numbers had dropped a further 47 per cent.@@@In fact, when the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) hit in 2021, that number fell to a mere 3.400 visitors, representing a 98 per cent decrease from the 2015 numbers.@@@I share those figures to underscore our susceptibility to external influences and the profound impact they have on our national economy.@@@Already suffering from the drop in tourism.@@@Palau was hit hard by the worldwide delay of goods caused by the pandemic.@@@Factories shut down and logistical challenges led to delays in the delivery of equipment and supplies.@@@Prices soared.@@@Russia’s invasion of Ukraine further aggravated the situation, causing gas prices to skyrocket.@@@The economic downturn experienced by Palau underscores the interconnectedness of our global community.@@@If tourism challenges and COVID-19 were the one-two punch, the inflated cost of goods could have very well knocked us out.@@@Luckily for us, we had the help and support of partners.@@@The invasion of Ukraine by Russia, although geographically distant, had a ripple effect that led to the inflation of prices in Palau.@@@That situation raises the importance of security and how destabilizing conflict can be to world order.@@@There are Palauans today who survived a war that was not of their own making, only to suffer the ripple effects of another.@@@Current events serve as a stark reminder of the urgent need for peace and stability worldwide.@@@We unequivocally condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and call for an immediate cessation of hostilities.@@@Similarly, we urge the United Nations and all parties involved in the Taiwan Straits to exercise restraint and seek a peaceful resolution to reduce tensions.@@@The well-being and prosperity of nations and their economies are intrinsically linked to global peace and stability.@@@For the past two years, we have been striving to build a resilient economy amidst external pressures.@@@A significant challenge has been outmigration.@@@Since 1994, when we gained our independence, nearly half our population has left to seek new opportunities beyond our shores.@@@That brain drain has not only reduced local capacity but also hindered growth.@@@We are grateful to partner nations, including the United States.@@@Japan.@@@Taiwan.@@@Australia and others, that provide assistance and training to assist with capacity and upskill the local population as well.@@@We are also encouraged by discussions to promote economic investments that can potentially create job opportunities that can help discourage outmigration and promote economic growth.@@@Climate change is the most significant challenge to our progress towards achieving sustainable development.@@@The impacts are evident in our coastal 
areas, agricultural lands, marine resources, cultural heritage and, most important, our livelihoods.@@@Assistance in mitigating and adapting to those impacts is crucial to our continued progress and survival.@@@In my youth.@@@I would spearfish on the reef with my father, helping to provide for our family.@@@There was one remote island in Palau’s southern waters where we would go.@@@It was alive with birds, turtles, fish, and clams.@@@Recently.@@@I revisited that island with my children, witnessing turtles laying eggs.@@@The island had diminished in size by two-thirds due to sea-level rise.@@@Sadly, half of the turtle eggs laid that night were in the tidal zone and unlikely to survive.@@@That heart-wrenching reality mirrors the fate of our homes and cultures if we fail to take decisive action.@@@We urgently call on the Group of 20 (G-20) nations, responsible for 80 per cent of global carbon emissions, to uphold their commitments to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and to limit warming to 1.5°C.@@@That is crucial to mitigating such climate change impacts like disappearing islands and unhatched turtle eggs.@@@As major emitters.@@@G-20@@@nations have a crucial role to play in emission reduction and leading the path towards sustainable development.@@@We urge the United Nations to simplify access to multilateral funds for SIDS and other vulnerable communities, promoting a faster transition.@@@We call on the international community to work with SIDS to increase access to climate finance.@@@We believe that it is time that we change the metrics we use to determine how we access those funds by using a better, multi-vulnerability index.@@@However, we must ensure that commitments pledged here are acted upon and not forgotten.@@@We have a saying in Palau: Ng ko er a teribsel a daob —“Let us not be like the foam riding on the waves of the ocean, drifting without settling.”@@@That Palauan saying refers to meetings where much is said but afterwards no action is taken.@@@Despite those challenges, we acknowledge the progress that has been made.@@@The twenty-sixth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Glasgow and the twenty-seventh Conference in Sharm-al-Sheik were successful, leading to green domestic policies in some of the world’s largest economies.@@@We appreciate the support of nations opposing and placing a moratorium on deep-sea mining.@@@Proponents argue that seabed minerals aid renewable transition, but the reality is we lack knowledge about potential impacts on underwater ecosystems that devastating activity could have.@@@We know that disturbing the ocean bed could release stored carbon dioxide, directly setting back our efforts to combat climate change.@@@We advocate for a global deep- sea mining moratorium, adhering to the precautionary principle of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.@@@On a positive note, tomorrow Palau will sign the international legally binding instrument under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond areas of national jurisdiction.@@@Universal participation is crucial, especially on the part of developed countries that can provide implementation means and engage in areas beyond national jurisdiction activities.@@@This moment signifies global unity in protecting high seas biodiversity.@@@Palau also takes this opportunity to second United States President Joseph Biden’s call for Security Council reform.@@@We believe that such reform would introduce fresh perspectives and allow nations like Japan a permanent seat in the Council, which has seen little change since its establishment in 1945.@@@We also propose considering the abolishment of veto powers, which can obstruct effective United Nations action.@@@The upcoming Summit of the Future in 2024 and the eightieth anniversary of the United Nations in 2025 present fitting opportunities to demonstrate progress in the Security Council.@@@We also advocate for change regarding the Republic of China on Taiwan, which has been unjustly excluded from United Nations processes despite its remarkable leadership and innovative solutions.@@@Taiwan has collaborated with Palau on vital issues such as tourism, agriculture, ocean conservation, climate, gender equality, education and innovation.@@@We urge the United Nations to allow Taiwan’s meaningful participation in crucial specialized agencies and processes like the World Health Organization, the International Civil Aviation Organization and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.@@@Taiwan’s 23 million people have much to offer the world.@@@The Charter of the United Nations affirms the equal rights of all peoples and nations.@@@We urge the United Nations to uphold that vision by allowing Taiwan to participate and contribute.@@@Our world is under siege from war and climate change, threats that undermine sustainable development and have driven many into poverty.@@@The Ukraine crisis 
exemplifies this, with lives lost, property destroyed and essential supplies disrupted.@@@Those crises are not distant threats but harsh realities affecting millions, including those in the Pacific islands.@@@We must act now to improve life across our shared ocean and world.@@@The Palauan story of Tebang teaches us the power of unity.@@@Tebang and his friends went to the forest to fell a large tree, to be carved into a canoe.@@@Unfortunately, the log ended up in a taro swamp.@@@Unable to move it.@@@Tebang went home to consult his father, who gave him a chant.@@@He returned with all his friends, and together they chanted HkamuuF or “It can move!”@@@They began pulling in unison, which allowed the log to be pulled from the swamp to the shoreline to be carved into a canoe.@@@Just as Tebang and his friends moved the log, we too can move mountains if we speak and act together.@@@Our task may be daunting, but remember: “IkamuuF We can move towards a sustainable future where our grandchildren can breathe clean air, swim in pristine seas, live in peace and prosper.@@@So let us raise our voices together and chant our own “/kamuuF Let us move this world towards a better tomorrow.@@@Together, we are unstoppable.@@@Together, we can ensure a thriving planet for generations to come.@@@Let us seize this moment with unity and determination.@@@Let us unite for a better tomorrow, because together, we can move.@@@We are truly stronger together.@@@When the Assembly was established almost 80 years ago, the world was still reeling from the horrors of a catastrophic bloodletting that our nations resolved should never be repeated.@@@A decision — profound in wisdom, magnanimous in intent and bold in ambition — was made so that the General Assembly would become the main deliberative, policy making and representative organ of the United Nations.@@@That decision manifested no less than the very strength and courage of our convictions.@@@By giving equal voice to the sovereign nations of the world, the founders of the United Nations pursued a vision of a more democratic world, predicated on the dictates of equity and justice.@@@It was a vision that consigned to the past the predations of the strong over the weak, of the rich and powerful over the poor and the marginalized, and of the big Powers over the rest.@@@That vision, in my opinion, has been utterly shattered to pieces.@@@Today, we find that the major Powers and those that aspire to greater international status are increasingly casting the United Nations aside for smaller, supposedly more efficacious platforms.@@@As the Powers continue to pay lip service to the imperative of multilateralism, we see the emergence of multilateralism instead, effectively becoming fragmented configurations of power.@@@We are living in a deeply polarized world.@@@We are seeing major Power rivalry unfolding with consequences that will negatively impact nations, especially the smaller ones, in the regions of conflict.@@@The upshot is that we are confronted with a geopolitical and geostrategic dilemma.@@@While the major Powers continue to assure us that a binary choice is not being imposed, the reality for many is that it is the only choice offered.@@@Unchecked, that will ultimately lead once again to a world where the masses are unrepresented, where the few rule over the many, and the many resent the few.@@@The lofty ideals and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations call upon nations to resolve their disputes through peaceful means and to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity and sovereignty or political independence of any State.@@@We condemn unequivocally the Russian invasion of Ukraine.@@@The conflict in Ukraine, for example, underscores the imperative to make peace and settle differences amicably through negotiations.@@@Nevertheless, time is not on our side, and owing to the protracted failure to deal with the Russia-Ukraine crisis.@@@I urge a concerted multilateral effort led by the United Nations to resolve it.@@@We cannot choose our neighbours, but we can choose to live in peace with them.@@@And peace cannot happen without the cessation of hostilities by all parties.@@@It is imperative for all parties to return to dialogue and resolve their differences through the negotiation table.@@@The extent of the Ukraine conflict has radiated throughout the world as food prices have skyrocketed, leading to shortages and hunger, further malnutrition and despair.@@@As in other conflicts elsewhere, be it in the Middle East or South-East Asia, forced migrations take place, piling on the problems of refugees and statelessness.@@@In the Middle East, the politics of dispossession continue with a vengeance with more illegal settlements being built, stripping Palestinians of land that rightfully belongs to them.@@@That constitutes a gross violation of international law.@@@It also poses an insurmountable obstacle to a two-State solution, not to mention the continued killings.@@@There is also flagrant hypocrisy in dealing with the issue of Palestine.@@@The international community must speak up against the atrocities committed towards the Palestinians even as they so vehemently speak out against human rights violations, injustice and abusive regimes.@@@On Afghanistan.@@@Malaysia remains deeply concerned over the dire humanitarian situation in the country.@@@That is especially so given that the country is grappling with its third consecutive year of drought and a devastating locust infestation that has severely undermined wheat harvests.@@@On our part.@@@Malaysia is committed to continuing its existing people-to- people relations with Afghanistan, including through the provision of humanitarian aid.@@@However, we remain resolute and firm in our call on the authorities of Afghanistan to reverse their exclusionary and discriminatory policies against women and girls.@@@Denying their right to go to school is a violation of the teachings of Islam, not to mention the Charter of the United Nations and the multilateral framework of human rights.@@@They are also profoundly detrimental to the future of Afghanistan.@@@We are deeply horrified by the continued post-coup violence and instability in Myanmar.@@@The situation in that country is currently among South-East Asia’s biggest strategic and humanitarian challenges in recent years.@@@The barbarism and depravity inflicted upon the people of Myanmar are indefensible and go against the values and principles shared by the peoples of the region and globally.@@@The support of the international community, including the United Nations, is crucial to urge continuously and maintain the necessary pressure on the military authorities to reverse their course.@@@In as much as the principle of the centrality of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) dictates that the continued atrocities must end.@@@Malaysia calls on Myanmar to immediately implement the ASEAN five-point consensus towards achieving peace and stability in the country.@@@ASEAN is navigating the rivalry between major Powers in the Asia-Pacific.@@@Malaysia believes that any strategy undertaken should neither start nor exacerbate a race for dominance.@@@Instead, such strategies should contribute to peace and stability, security and prosperity in the region.@@@Scientists have confirmed that the world has just experienced its hottest summer in history.@@@We have heard Secretary-General Guterres gravely declare that climate breakdown has begun.@@@Even Malaysia is seeing an increase in the adverse impacts of climate change, with increasing temperatures, rising sea levels, intensified monsoons and erratic weather patterns disrupting livelihoods and degrading local ecosystems.@@@As such, we have not a moment to lose.@@@Malaysia is doing its part by developing low- carbon and renewable energy road maps to implement mitigating and adaptation strategies.@@@The newly launched National Energy Transition Roadmap should aid us in achieving our nationally determined contributions, as well as lighting the path towards our net zero aspirations.@@@Discussions on climate change in the absence of equity, justice and the necessary means to assist and empower countries to undertake greater climate action are an exercise in futility.@@@We also urge the developed countries to fulfil their commitment to mobilizing $100 billion a year to support the climate ambition endeavours of developing countries, while recognizing that trillions of dollars per annum will be needed in the near future.@@@The Sustainable Development Goals Report 2023 has confirmed that we are falling behind, with nearly a third of the targets either in a state of inertia or, worse, regressing.@@@The global economy is also projected to continue to be weighed down by geopolitical uncertainties, supply chain disruptions, increase in commodity prices and challenging financial conditions.@@@That has widened the gap between economic growth and income, leading to a continuous disparity.@@@As the growth in incomes fails to match economic growth, households become burdened with debt.@@@We now have 
the super-rich living side by side with the ultra-poor.@@@The contrast lies starkly in the things that matter: food on the table, shelter, access to quality education and health care.@@@Those factors cry out for drastic, systemic reform — a total reset of the global institutions that impact our lives — or else we will continue to face widening inequality setting apart nations and peoples.@@@We are concerned over the emergence of a new form of racism characterized by xenophobia, negative profiling and the stereotyping of Muslims.@@@That is manifested in an alarming trend of hatred, intolerance, and acts of violence against Muslims and their sanctities.@@@We are appalled by the legitimization of these acts under the feeble defence of human rights.@@@The burning of the Holy Qur’an is nothing but a clear Islamophobic act intended to incite hatred.@@@Inaction in the face of such blatant provocation to a religion is simply irresponsible and sends a dangerous message to humankind.@@@We must embody the values of acceptance, tolerance and mutual respect.@@@We must promote intercultural, inter-civilizational and inter-religious understanding and cooperation.@@@We must unite our faiths in common causes to promote understanding and goodwill among our peoples and strengthen peace and harmony among nations.@@@Those are indeed tall orders, but that is the very reason we are here.@@@I truly believe that no challenge, however formidable, is insurmountable if we secure the collective commitment of the global community, the States Members of this institution.@@@What we need is trust, the conviction to make the world a better place and the will to work together on a platform of consensus and solidarity.@@@Early this year.@@@I introduced Malaysia Madani, a vision built on the pillars of the core values that we believe are indispensable in any harmonious, thriving and peaceful society: compassion, respect, trust, innovation, prosperity and sustainability.@@@Those basic principles and moral values also apply in the context of our relations with other countries.@@@Whether it is the Group of Seven, the Group of 20, the Group of 77, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation or the world’s largest free trade area, there is no denying that multilateral collaboration is the sine qua non for any effective and sustainable resolution to the crises that beset the world.@@@In that regard, it bears stressing that Malaysia’s commitment to the United Nations and the multilateral system is born out of our strong conviction that all countries, no matter how big or small, rich or poor, strong or weak, have a common responsibility to create a better world for tomorrow.@@@The world and our future in it is what we envision and construct it to be.@@@Malaysia believes that we can achieve this through greater trust and strengthened multilateralism.@@@The United Nations can be the vessel to take us from despondency to a brighter future, from uncertainty to optimism, and from vulnerability to resilience.@@@I would like my opening words to be an expression of the Spanish people’s solidarity with the victims of the earthquake in Morocco and the floods in Libya.@@@Spain will continue to support those two friendly countries in mitigating the consequences of those terrible tragedies in every way possible.@@@On 10 September, a young Spanish aid worker lost her life in the Bakhmut region of Ukraine.@@@The vehicle in which she was travelling was hit by artillery fire, killing another aid worker and seriously injuring two others.@@@All four shared the same zeal — a zeal that ennobles the soul of every human being and transcends borders, and that was none other than helping those most in need.@@@That was not the only thing that they had in common.@@@Above all, it was their activism that brought them together.@@@They brought supplies and food to civilians.@@@They provided medical assistance, and they evacuated the injured.@@@Their example demands of us quiet, but also pressing reflection on the need to take a stand against injustice and to not remain silent when human rights and the most basic rules of peaceful coexistence among nations are being violated.@@@This Hall has been witness to many memorable addresses by leaders such as Salvador Allende.@@@Olof Palme and Nelson Mandela.@@@We should of course draw inspiration from their words.@@@But the urgency of the challenges requires us to do more than revel in rhetoric.@@@As has been said at this rostrum, it is time to take action because time is simply running out.@@@We are at a crossroads: change or let ourselves be driven by the course of events, progress or retreat, work together or look out for ourselves, build a lasting future or revive the past, or content ourselves with words or move on to action.@@@The first dilemma that I would like to mention in this address relates to the climate emergency.@@@We have just experienced the hottest months ever recorded.@@@Extreme weather events are becoming increasingly frequent, with devastating consequences for every continent.@@@According to the experts, we are entering uncharted territory.@@@It is no longer a case of trying to slow the rise in temperatures; it is a matter of mitigation and, as far as possible, adaptation to a situation that is already here.@@@Thanks to science, we know that we must limit the rise in temperature to 1.5°C; that global emissions cannot peak any later than the year 2025; and that we have no other choice than to expedite the roll-out of renewable energies, and to do so in a fair and equitable manner, in order to triple their generation capacity by the end of this decade.@@@Moreover, we must do that in a spirit of solidarity with the most vulnerable countries by driving the adaptation agenda forward and implementing the loss and damage agreement reached in Sharm El-Sheikh last year.@@@Tackling the climate emergency requires courage and determination.@@@We need to bring about an unprecedented technological and economic revolution, which will be possible only with broad, resolute and global support.@@@That support demands intelligence to overcome climate inaction’s main ally, which is none other than denialism.@@@That is possible if we transform the daunting challenge before us into an opportunity to create more and better jobs, make all sectors of our economies more sustainable and, in short, keep moving forward hand in hand with science.@@@On that path, my country.@@@Spain, speaks with deeds rather than words.@@@We have set more ambitious renewable energy and energy efficiency targets in the National Integrated Energy and Climate Plan.@@@We will contribute €225 million to the Green Climate Fund.@@@€20 million to the Adaptation Fund and more than €17 million to instruments that strengthen climate justice, particularly funds for the most vulnerable countries and the loss and damage fund.@@@Just today, on behalf of Spain, we signed the Treaty of the High Seas, which is another step in support of the balance of nature following the historic Kunming-Montreal agreement.@@@It is crucial that the upcoming twenty-eighth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in the United Arab Emirates, be a resounding success.@@@Spain is fully committed to achieving that.@@@The second area in which we face a difficult decision is the defence of democracy, fundamental rights, equality and social justice.@@@We are witnessing a profound crisis of apathy and distrust of democratic institutions.@@@There is a wave of extremism and reactionary thinking rising throughout the world, which is also present in Europe, propelled by movements that share the same strategy, namely, promising a return to a mythical past that in reality never existed; marginalizing and criminalizing disadvantaged minorities; rejecting equality and trivializing feminism; and questioning human, civil and social rights.@@@Ideas that we thought had been abandoned are returning and are flourishing in places where social discontent is the highest.@@@As a result, it is not easy to counter those who make lies, fear and manipulation their main weapon.@@@But I believe — and this is what I would also like to share — that there is reason for hope in the ultimate determination of many societies to uphold a legacy of achievements and progress that brooks no turning back.@@@Such a path demonstrates the bold and resolute stance of civil society as a whole in Spain, particularly in the area of gender equality, as has recently been evident in the field of sport, especially in women’s sport and women’s football.@@@Spain has declared that “enough is enough”, with all its implications, because every step forward that a woman takes is a step forward for us all, men and women, alongside them.@@@There is clearly a very long way to go, and there are many battles to be waged, if we are to achieve full equality among men and women, none more pressing than the eradication of male violence once and for all, the existence of which some people even dare to question against all reason.@@@In my view, there is no better antidote to reactionary extremism than feminism, which is without a doubt one of the leading causes of our century, which is the century of women.@@@That commitment to gender equality must also be reflected at the multilateral level and, more specifically, in the top leadership positions of multilateral institutions themselves.@@@It is therefore important that upcoming appointments in the United Nations system, including in the General Assembly, take the gender factor into account.@@@In these turbulent years, we have seen an increasing threat to democracy in many places of the world.@@@We witnessed it in Washington.@@@D.C., and Brasilia, and, unfortunately, now also in the Niger and Gabon.@@@Regrettably, we have learned not to take for granted as irreversible the rights and freedoms for which other generations valiantly fought.@@@The 26 July coup d’etat in the Niger has serious implications, since, together with Mauritania, the Niger was the only country in the Sahel with a democratically elected Government.@@@The region, which has been in decline for years, risks becoming a series of failed States that could spread instability to neighbouring regions already plagued by the threat of terrorism.@@@It is therefore crucial that we find a peaceful way out without resorting to military force.@@@In that regard.@@@I would like to reiterate our support for the mediation efforts of the Economic Community of West African States.@@@Spain will always be a committed partner in furthering the strengthening of democracy, not only in the context of fair elections, the essence of the democratic principle, but also in terms of the body of institutions that enable citizens to fully enjoy their fundamental rights, particularly as relates to wealth distribution and development.@@@In that respect, we are working closely with our Latin American partners, with whom we share values, principles and goals, so as to strengthen partnerships and share experiences.@@@A good example of that is the transitional justice work that Colombia has undertaken towards full peace.@@@It is a commendable achievement, which Spain wishes to continue to support in all that is necessary to conclude the current ongoing peace talks.@@@The constitutional reform in Chile is another example of a bold commitment to institutional reform, and that country can count on Spain’s support.@@@Furthermore.@@@Spain also reiterates its commitment to the necessary return to the path of democracy in Venezuela in order to restore hope to its people for a future of opportunities.@@@The third and last crossroads that I would like to mention in this address concerns the defence of multilateralism and a rules-based international order.@@@The United Nations system is the embodiment of a desire to jointly achieve global solutions to our shared challenges and resolve differences through diplomacy, dialogue and cooperation.@@@The challenge now is to 
demonstrate that the system works for all.@@@Otherwise, inequality will be fertile ground for the rhetoric of multilateralism’s enemies to thrive.@@@It is therefore crucial that we step up to support the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@We must boldly stand up to those who use manipulation and lies to challenge that great collective effort.@@@The summit held at the beginning of this week should serve to renew our commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).@@@Unfortunately, we are not on track to meet the 17 Sustainable Development Goals.@@@If we continue on that path, in 2030.@@@575 million people will still be living in extreme poverty and 84 million children will remain out of school.@@@At that rate, it will take 300 years to close the gender gap.@@@I see that as a morally unacceptable failure.@@@I reiterate that this is the time not for words, but for deeds.@@@We must increase our commitments to official development assistance.@@@Spain has just adopted a new cooperation act, with the commitment to allocate 0.7 per cent of its gross national income to development by 2030.@@@We will continue to prioritize key issues, contributing €120 million to the Sustainable Development Goals Fund and another €20 million to replenish the International Fund for Agricultural Development over the next three years.@@@But we must go further.@@@We must equip ourselves with adequate resources and tools to make progress on sustainable development between now and 2030.@@@It will not be easy to mobilize the financing required to tackle the climate emergency and make the long-term investments that vulnerable countries need in order to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@But it is essential to do so with approaches that reflect the current needs and realities and with the courage to stop measuring financing for sustainable development in billions of dollars, but instead measure it in trillions.@@@In that context.@@@Spain advocates strengthening existing mechanisms, ensuring that countries can access the necessary financing, regardless of their income level.@@@But we also support reforming those mechanisms and innovation by setting up new instruments.@@@We need to maximize and optimize the financing capacity of multilateral development banks and explore ways to make the international financial architecture more effective, more inclusive, more transparent and, ultimately, more democratic.@@@We need to adapt international taxation to the current reality and ensure that private investment is aligned with the SDGs.@@@I believe that the United Nations framework should be the main forum for such a discussion, since it is the only one that can bring together the voices of all countries on equal terms.@@@Spain wishes to actively contribute to this urgent debate.@@@I am therefore declaring our intention to host the fourth International Conference on Financing for Development in 2025, and we hope that it will have a truly transformative impact.@@@Coexistence, peacekeeping and safeguarding international security are not a mere aspiration.@@@The Preamble to the Charter of the United Nations serves as the guide to upholding that desire, a commitment that links our and future generations.@@@Peace is the essential prerequisite for economic development, as well as the expansion of human rights, which takes on particular significance as we mark the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.@@@Many conflicts are still raging; others have reached a deadlock.@@@I would therefore like to reiterate the Spanish Government’s resolute support for the work of the Secretary-General’s special envoys for the Middle East peace process.@@@Syria and Libya.@@@With regard to Western Sahara.@@@Spain supports a mutually acceptable political solution, within the framework of the United Nations Charter and the Security Council resolutions.@@@The work of the Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General for Western Sahara is crucial and has the full support of the Government of Spain.@@@Likewise, we will continue to support the Sahrawi population in camps, as we have always done, maintaining our role as the leading international donor of humanitarian aid in that context.@@@Meanwhile, on 31 December 2020.@@@Spain and the United Kingdom concluded a bilateral agreement on Gibraltar in the context of the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union.@@@Since then, we have worked tirelessly in order for that understanding to form the basis for that territory’s future relationship with the European Union, trusting that the European Union and the United Kingdom will be able to reach an agreement regarding Gibraltar as soon as possible.@@@For us, such an agreement must be completely in line with the United Nations position on that territory, with which Spain fully aligns itself.@@@It must also fully respect my country’s legal position regarding sovereignty and jurisdiction in relation to Gibraltar.@@@We wish to work 
for the development of a prosperous socioeconomic area that encompasses the whole of Gibraltar as well as the Campo de Gibraltar region.@@@At this point I would like to share some thoughts on the future of Europe from the perspective of the presidency of the Council of the European Union, which Spain currently holds.@@@The European Union was born out of a bid for peace on a continent that was devastated and traumatized following two world wars in barely three decades.@@@From the ashes of destruction emerged a firm resolve, namely, that never again would there be war.@@@From the memory of the tragedy was born the determination to shape a shared prosperity, which has provided the European continent with the longest period of peace in its history.@@@In an attempt to undermine the irrefutable success of that unifying project, some have sought to caricature it by portraying the European Union as a giant with feet of clay, incapable of standing up for itself with any real conviction.@@@Yet, when faced with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and contrary to Putin’s expectations.@@@Europe has decisively responded to Russia’s atrocities in a united way, making it clear that we do not accept that anyone should violate the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter.@@@From this rostrum.@@@I once again condemn Russia’s unjustified and illegal war of aggression against Ukraine.@@@As a show of our support.@@@I launched the Spanish European Union presidency right there in Kyiv on 1 July.@@@Spain will continue to stand by Ukraine for as long as it is necessary.@@@But we will also actively work to achieve a fair and lasting peace that restores Ukraine’s sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity and allows the Ukrainian people to freely determine their own fate.@@@I believe in a Europe that is at the vanguard of defending global public goods, democracy, labour and social protection and economic openness, a Europe that leads the fight against inequality and the protection of individual rights and public freedoms.@@@That Europe is already here, and it is moving resolutely forward thanks to two essential factors: first, a commitment to a collective agenda that is more supportive, fairer and more inclusive than the one that emerged from the 2008 financial crisis and, secondly, the unanimity and decisiveness with which it has responded to the critical events of these past four years.@@@That is the path along which the European ideal must continue to advance, whatever the challenges.@@@Europe must lead by example on the climate agenda by delivering on our pledge to reduce emissions, fulfilling international climate financing pledges and expediting the energy transition.@@@It must promote an exemplary migration policy given the hugely significant global problem, which looks likely to increase in scale and severity in the decades to come.@@@We need to control irregular immigration and provide channels for orderly, regular migration, which we clearly need in Europe.@@@Furthermore.@@@Europe has the responsibility to push globally for a more human-centric and rights-oriented digital transformation.@@@We need to lay the groundwork for the regulation of artificial intelligence, the vast challenges and possibilities of which do not outweigh its hidden risks.@@@In that regard.@@@Spain is committed to supporting the Secretary-General’s Envoy on Technology with resources and know-how in developing multilateral governance in that area.@@@We would like to host the headquarters of a future international artificial intelligence agency.@@@In short.@@@Europe needs to perform that role without shutting itself off.@@@Nothing would be more profoundly anti-European than an isolated European Union.@@@We must therefore strengthen partnerships with our transatlantic partners, such as the United States of America and Canada, as well as our Asian.@@@African and Latin American partners.@@@Spain has always placed a particular emphasis on boosting relations between the European Union and the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean through a new agenda that sets out a strategic relationship with the region.@@@I am confident that the European Union-Community of Latin American and Caribbean States summit will be a genuine turning point that has a lasting impact.@@@In conclusion, at the beginning of my address I spoke of a brave woman who lost her life in Bakhmut, in Ukraine, while transporting humanitarian aid.@@@Her name was Emma Igual.@@@She was 32 years old.@@@Emma was the granddaughter of a Holocaust survivor who lost almost all her family during the Nazi era.@@@She came to Spain from Austria and was adopted by a family from Barcelona.@@@The life of the grandmother and the senseless killing of her granddaughter.@@@Emma, were shaped by events that, in essence, led to the founding and purpose of this institution, namely, to save humanity from the 
scourge of war and to reaffirm faith in the dignity and value of the human being.@@@If there is a place in which the story and life of Emma deserve to be told, without a doubt it is here before the General Assembly of the United Nations.@@@Let her example, and the examples set every day by thousands of aid workers around the world, inspire us to do what this critical time requires of us at every crossroads that I mentioned, to let our actions and achievements speak for themselves and to turn our words into deeds.@@@In that way let us honour the memory of those who, like Emma, gave everything, nothing less, to defend the values that inspire this noble Organization.@@@It is an honour to address the General Assembly today on behalf of President Ferdinand Romualdez Marcos Jr, of the Philippines and to reaffirm my country’s solidarity with the United Nations.@@@As a founding Member of our Organization, our commitment to multilateralism, with the Charter of the United Nations as its bedrock, is unwavering.@@@The United Nations has bound our nations with the common purpose to uplift our shared humanity — through the ravages of Second World War, conflicts and regional and global pandemics — by establishing the universality of human rights and human dignity, and with a rules-based order underpinned by international law that guarantees the flourishing in peace of free and equal nations.@@@With the United Nations at the centre amid the tides of challenge and change, multilateralism must rise to the occasion.@@@The spirit of our Organization calls on us to respond decisively to existential threats 
such as global warming, degrading ecosystems, diseases and food insecurity, and to reclaim the power of dialogue and diplomacy as we manage new complexities of conflict and strategic competition.@@@We must configure our work to the realities of our time, placing people and communities at the heart of our agenda, refocusing consensus through differences and recognizing the agency of many voices — not only the powerful few — in shaping our shared future.@@@The theme of this year’s session of the Assembly frames a global conversation on solidarity and trust as essential enablers of global action.@@@Greater solidarity and trust also arise as outcomes of shared triumphs; they thrive more when multilateralism works and weaken when our global institutions fail to deliver dividends for the benefit of all.@@@The preservation of a rules-based global order is our collective responsibility.@@@The United Nations is underwritten by a rules-based order governed by international law and informed by the principles of equity and of justice.@@@Its present and future rest on the predictability and stability of international law, which safeguards the rights of all States.@@@If multilateralism is to endure, all States must adhere to the rule of law.@@@Guided by an independent foreign policy, the Philippines actively works with nations to promote a rules-based international order.@@@We advocate the peaceful settlement of disputes in accordance with international law.@@@That has always been our position with respect to the disputes in the West Philippine Sea, in as much as we are prepared to defend our sovereignty, sovereign rights and territorial integrity.@@@As President Marcos Jr, has declared, we are a friend to all and an enemy to none.@@@Our Constitution renounces war as an instrument of national policy, adopts the generally accepted principles of international law as part of the law of the land and adheres to a policy of peace, equality, justice, freedom, cooperation and amity with all nations.@@@We recognize the role of international legal bodies in fostering greater solidarity around the values that underpin the United Nations.@@@This year, the General Assembly adopted by consensus resolution 77/322 to celebrate the one hundred and twenty-fifth anniversary of the Permanent Court of Arbitration.@@@As an archipelagic State whose destiny is intimately linked to the oceans, the Philippines is a champion of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), and we are proud to have been among the first States to have signed this week the Agreement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas beyond National Jurisdiction, which opens new windows for cooperation in the responsible stewardship of the high seas.@@@The primacy of UNCLOS was affirmed by the 2016 arbitral award on the South China Sea, which definitively settled the status of historic rights and maritime entitlements in the South China Sea, declaring without legal effect claims that exceed entitlements beyond the geographic and substantive limits of UNCLOS.@@@For the past seven years, we have celebrated that award, which is now part of international law.@@@Adherence to international law contributes to keeping the Indo-Pacific region, with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) at the centre, free, open, stable and peaceful.@@@In line with that, we are guided by the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific.@@@During the Cold War, the Philippines shepherded the adoption of the 1982 Manila Declaration on the Peaceful Settlement of International Disputes, convinced that our world should not descend again into large-scale conflict when the possibility of nuclear catastrophe loomed.@@@Humankind remains in a state of danger because there are too many destructive and disruptive weapons now in existence.@@@With thousands of nuclear warheads still present and the fissile material cut-off treaty unrealized, heightened arms races and new method of warfare, including in the cyber and space domains, have transformed the strategic landscape of the twenty-first century.@@@More than ever, the rule of law must reign.@@@During his address to the Assembly last year.@@@President Marcos Jr, called for rules and norms for the responsible use of emerging technologies (see A/77/PV.5).@@@The Philippines is working with partners to establish rules to govern lethal autonomous weapons systems.@@@In that regard, we will host an Indo-Pacific meeting in December.@@@We advocate the peaceful uses of outer space, the elaboration of the principle of due regard in the space domain and greater responsibility among States to reduce space threats, including debris from rocket launches.@@@We call for United Nations partnerships that guarantee that new technologies are not weaponized or misused in any way to subvert democracy and freedom, challenge international humanitarian law, exploit the vulnerable or violate human rights and human dignity.@@@We are profoundly concerned about the excessive suffering caused across the globe by extreme weather events.@@@That phenomenon reminds us of three realities, namely, that climate change is evolving into a full crisis, that the fight against global warming and sea level rise is a race against time and that effective climate action requires stronger multilateral cooperation.@@@We need decisive, responsible, just and sustainable solutions that look after populations and protect those who have contributed the least to global warming but have the highest vulnerability by virtue of their geography.@@@That is the meaning of solidarity on climate action.@@@More than a decade ago, the Philippines pioneered the adoption of a resolution in the Human Rights Council that drew attention to the impact of climate change on human rights.@@@While we are heartened that that link is now acknowledged, much more remains to be done.@@@We join the call for industrialized countries to abide by their obligations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.@@@We look forward to the adoption of decisions by the twenty-eighth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change concerning the establishment of a loss and damage fund and other climate financing mechanisms.@@@We thank Vanuatu and the core group of States for rallying the United Nations to bring the question of State obligations relating to climate change to the International Court of Justice.@@@The Philippines will participate actively in the proceedings.@@@Moreover, we stand in solidarity with island States taking part in the proceedings of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea on obligations relating to climate change and the marine environment under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.@@@Cognizant that the future will see more climate-induced migration and displacement, as acknowledged in the Global Compact for Migration, the Philippines and the International Organization for Migration convened a ministerial round table on climate change and migration in the Asia-Pacific region earlier this week in New York.@@@With the Asia-Pacific Ministerial Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction to be held in Manila in 2024, the Philippines aims to effectively build a bridge between disaster risk resilience and the climate agenda.@@@We are in the home stretch for securing Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) outcomes globally.@@@The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is well- integrated in the Philippines’ mid- and long-term development plans, and we can unlock opportunities for the Philippines and developing countries, including middle-income countries, to advance South-South cooperation and achieve development goals worldwide.@@@As a middle-income country, we support initiatives to make international financial and development mechanisms better attuned to the needs of middle-income countries.@@@Our partnerships should bridge development divides.@@@Our collaboration for the future should make our societies more resilient, more cohesive and more humane, and as I stated at the SDG Summit earlier this week, if we work together, sustainable is attainable.@@@The continued reform of the United Nations development system is key to ensuring that the Organization delivers transformative development outcomes.@@@The United Nations and its specialized agencies and funds have the duty of providing efficient, coherent and accountable support to host States, with the consent of the latter and in accordance with their national development priorities.@@@Solidarity prepares the ground for international cooperation as we reinforce the global health security system, taking into account the lessons of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.@@@Together with like-minded States, the Philippines has called for equity in the provision of vaccines and resilient health services in the negotiations on the global pandemic treaty.@@@We must never again witness a global emergency on such a scale, in which those most in need will be provided for last.@@@The Philippines supports the World Health Organization Contingency Fund for Emergencies, the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access Facility and other mechanisms that harness the power of partnerships to address persistent health challenges and emergencies.@@@We affirm that health is primordial to our human development agenda, and we are all indebted to the Filipino health-care workers at the front lines of the pandemic throughout the world.@@@We honour the many who lost their lives in the service of our common humanity.@@@The pandemic compelled the international community, especially countries of destination, to recognize the contributions of migrants to their societies and to protect their rights.@@@The Global Compact is the road map for that.@@@This year marks the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.@@@Represented by the late General Carlos P. Romulo, a former President 
of the General Assembly, the Philippines was an active member of the first Commission on Human Rights, which drafted that seminal document.@@@Following the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Philippines assumed a leading role in the drafting of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the framing of such instruments as the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families.@@@To date, the Philippines is party to eight core human rights instruments.@@@Recognizing human rights as unfinished business in all parts of the world, we are a dedicated advocate for the human rights of vulnerable groups, especially women, children, indigenous peoples, migrants, persons with disabilities, refugees and older persons.@@@However, human rights is first and foremost about people.@@@In order to foster trust and engagement, the dialogue on human rights must be genuine, based on evidence and depoliticized.@@@When constructive and carried out in good faith and with full respect for the agency of States, collaboration on human rights can achieve concrete impacts.@@@I have echoed the call for solidarity in fostering and advancing a multilateral architecture that promotes the rule of law and meets the pressing challenges of our century.@@@Such an architecture demands that we invest wisely in sound, inclusive and far-sighted multilateral institutions.@@@The Philippines supports multilateral institutions that adhere to the highest standards of good governance, equity, inclusivity, transparency and accountability.@@@We will work in concert with other nations towards a twenty-first century multilateralism that includes and works for the benefit of all.@@@The Philippines has served as a pathfinder for consensus on such issues as climate change and human rights and on security cooperation.@@@We will remain a bridge-builder.@@@In keeping with our tradition as a peacemaker, we will sustain our contributions to United Nations peacekeeping operations and continue implementing Security Council resolutions on counterterrorism and peace-building, among other areas.@@@The Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao embodies the vision of the Philippines for people-focused peace-building.@@@The Philippines candidacy for a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for the 2027-2028 term manifests our strong desire to offer the best of the Philippines diplomatic tradition.@@@We count on the support of all Member States in that regard.@@@Fully living up to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the aspirations of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights are unfinished projects, and their realization is in our hands — that is our challenge.@@@Through solidarity, we can foster a constructive multilateralism that embraces that challenge with courage and perseveres in hope and common purpose.@@@Namibia congratulates the President on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session.@@@Allow me to use this opportunity to pledge to him the commitment of Namibia to supporting the priorities he has set out, namely, peace, prosperity, progress and sustainability.@@@Namibia would also like to thank his predecessor.@@@Mr. Csaba Korosi, for steering with diligence the work of the seventy-seventh session of the General Assembly.
Let me state that Namibia agrees with Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who a few months ago said.@@@“Unless we act now, the 2030 Agenda will become an epitaph for a world that might have been”.@@@Therefore, the theme of the current session.@@@“Rebuilding trust and reigniting global solidarity: accelerating action on the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals towards peace, prosperity, progress and sustainability for all”, is fitting.@@@With the onset of the coronavirus disease, the number of people living in extreme poverty rose for the first time in a generation.@@@That demonstrates the fact that, at the midpoint to the global Goals, we face the stark reality that we will miss our Goals and targets.@@@The seventy-eighth session serves as a clarion call to reset and work in the true spirit of partnership for better results on the ground.@@@Indeed, the world is in a state of flux, and progress is uneven.@@@Taking cognizance of the interconnectedness between all the goals and targets, we should accelerate investment in health care, renewable energy, education, clean water and sanitation.@@@The terrifying gap between the wealthy and the marginalized is not just a moral concern but also a threat to political stability and harmony.@@@We are therefore duty-bound to create an environment in which prosperity is shared and inclusive.@@@In our collective pursuit of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@Namibia looks forward with hope and optimism to the Summit of the Future, to be held next year, as an opportunity to prioritize meaningful reforms that can reinvigorate the global goals in order to give impetus to the broader system-wide United Nations reform agenda.@@@Namibia also welcomes UN 2.0 and the Quintet of Change, aimed at providing the United Nations family with cutting- edge capabilities in data, digital, innovation, foresight and expertise in order to deliver better and effective Member State support to accelerate development.@@@The health of a nation is the bedrock for all development activities.@@@Today the General Assembly will adopt a political declaration on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response.@@@Pandemics have long been formidable adversaries that disproportionately wreak havoc on the socioeconomic fabric of developing countries.@@@Those crises go beyond their immediate health implications, unravelling years of development progress, straining health-care systems and exacerbating existing socioeconomic disparities.@@@We need to change the status quo.@@@To do so, we must end vaccine apartheid.@@@We need to ensure equitable access to health products.@@@We need stronger commitments from wealthy nations on technology transfer, the removal of intellectual property barriers, and investments in manufacturing in order to enable vaccine production in the global South.@@@I always say that inclusivity spells harmony and exclusivity spells conflict.@@@The continued advocacy for gender equality is core in our collective journey towards a just and inclusive world.@@@Therefore, advocating for gender equality is not only a matter of fairness but also an essential step towards unlocking innovation, diversity and social cohesion.@@@We are indeed proud to be ranked eighth in the world by the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Report 2023 for progress in closing the gender gap.@@@In addition to having 44 per cent female representation in Parliament, we have women in the positions of Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister.@@@The current Deputy Prime Minister has been selected by the ruling party to be a candidate for the presidency.@@@Very soon after I leave the Office of President in one year’s time, she may be the President to come and stand here.@@@Two thirds of our key banking institutions are headed by women.@@@In the same vein, we believe in promoting inclusive and effective governance that ensures that our young people are integrated into decision-making structures to play their part in the future they have helped to shape.@@@Rapid advances in technology, quantum computing and artificial intelligence are transforming the global landscape, offering unprecedented challenges and opportunities for growth and development.@@@Therefore, developing countries should not be left behind in the digital revolution.@@@Access to technology can bridge gaps in education, health care and economic development, propelling nations towards progress.@@@We must navigate technological challenges and harness opportunities by fostering an environment that is conducive to technology transfer, technology adoption, skills development and collaboration.@@@As we march towards the twenty-eighth Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change for the final global stocktake, we are acutely aware that the energy transition is not only a necessity in combating climate change but also an opportunity for economic development.@@@Consistent with their pledges made at the United Nations Climate Change Conference held in Paris in 2015, developed nations must provide financial and technological support to enable developing countries to shift to cleaner energy sources without hampering development.@@@Three years ago, during the seventy-fifth session of the General Assembly.@@@Namibia boldly announced its intention to change its economic structure by leveraging innovative financial tools to mobilize sustainable climate financing in order to combat climate change.@@@One year later in Glasgow.@@@Scotland, on the margins of COP 26, we announced the development of large-scale green hydrogen projects that would provide the world with the clean molecules needed to decarbonize hard- to-abate sectors.@@@Today we have more than five such projects under development and are looking to deploy more than $20 billion in order to develop our world-class renewable energy potential to give our future generations a fighting chance against a warming planet.@@@Developing a new synthetic fuels industry in Namibia is not just an opportunity to fight climate change; indeed, it also offers an unparalleled opportunity for green industrialization.@@@Namibia has now attracted new industries that are looking to make use of the cheap clean electricity and molecules to be produced in Namibia.@@@One such pioneering example is Project Oshivela by Uy Iron, which plans to use Namibian-produced green hydrogen to deliver the first industrial production of iron at net-zero emissions.@@@During the first phase of the project in 2024, an annual output of 15.000 tons of direct reduced iron is planned.@@@Project Oshivela will be one of the biggest primary production sites of green iron worldwide and is expected to sequestrate 27.000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year — equivalent to 50 per cent of the carbon dioxide emissions of Namibia’s entire power industry today.@@@In order to transport the clean molecules to their final destination, shipping — which is yet another hard- to-abate sector — will also need to deploy innovative solutions.@@@That is why Namibia is now developing green shipping corridors with the Maersk Mc-Kinney Moller Center for Zero-Carbon Shipping as we look to map and fund the development of carbon-neutral maritime value chains through the production, transportation, storage and consumption of clean fuels and carbon-free products made in Namibia and traded with the world.@@@We are working with Compagnie Maritime Beige, a Belgian shipping company, on plans to build a clean ammonia-bunkering facility in Walvis Bay, at a cost of more than €2.2 billion, in partnership with Namibia’s own Olthaver and List Group.@@@On 28 September this year, that partnership — named Cleanergy — is expected to reveal plans to construct its first Namibian green hydrogen multimodal service station.@@@I always say that we do not make peace with our friends; we make peace with our enemies.@@@Punitive measures imposed for more than half a century on the Republic of Cuba have brought untold hardships that have disenfranchised the Cuban people.@@@The embargo against the Cuban people remains unjust, and it must therefore be lifted.@@@Namibia appeals to the United States of America to remove the Republic of Cuba from the list of State sponsors of terrorism, as there is no evidence to support such a classification.@@@Selective punitive measures against Zimbabwe and Venezuela must also be lifted, as those measures constitute the greatest obstacle to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@The United Nations Charter remains an important source of inspiration, reflecting the commonly agreed values of diplomacy and peaceful coexistence.@@@We regard the Charter-enshrined right to self-determination for all peoples as essential.@@@That rings true for the people of Western Sahara.@@@While our right to self- determination has been upheld, the people of Western Sahara continue to remain under occupation.@@@We recall how Morocco supported our right to self-determination, and we now call on it to do the same for the people of Western Sahara.@@@Similarly, the people of Palestine yearn to transition from the inhumane conditions of oppressive rule.@@@Namibia is therefore pleased by the decision of the General Assembly to submit to the International Court of Justice a request for an advisory opinion on the legal consequences arising from the ongoing violation by Israel of the right of the Palestinian people to self- determination.@@@The challenges we face today are not insurmountable.@@@By holding hands and by renewing our commitment to multilateralism, we can reverse the worst effects of the unprecedented global challenges of global warming, global inequality, pandemics and conflicts.@@@By holding hands, we have it within us to act now and build the world that we want.@@@In that world, no one should feel left out.@@@We gather this year under ever-more daunting challenges.@@@Our window to address climate change is rapidly narrowing.@@@Progress in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is stagnating; in part, it is even being reversed.@@@There have never been more conflicts since the establishment of the United Nations.@@@The number of displaced persons is at record levels, and food insecurity has doubled since 2020.@@@Children are subject to more suffering than ever, and the urgently needed political consensus on key agendas is becoming more challenging.@@@The ability of the United Nations to function as the peace organization for our world is increasingly paralysed.@@@It is our joint responsibility to safeguard the international order for future generations.@@@In doing so, we have an opportunity to make the United Nations stronger, more equitable and more resilient.@@@Together with Member States, we are ready to tackle that task, with a sense of deep responsibility, as well as with courage and confidence in our ability to succeed.@@@There is a common thread to the various challenges that we are facing — the rule of law, which means that relations among States are governed by the law, that such law is the result of international agreements, that it applies to everyone and that there are consequences if it is violated.@@@That was the spirit that guided those who gathered in San Francisco in 1945 to agree on the Charter of the United Nations — the most successful and most impactful treaty ever adopted.@@@At its very heart, the United Nations is a peace organization.@@@It has risen from the ashes of two devastating world wars, and it makes a powerful promise to future generations that the United Nations Charter addresses: that we, gathered in this Assembly, will not allow unlawful war-making to bring devastation, human suffering and instability to the peoples that we represent.@@@As leaders, we have to ask self-critically: are we trying hard enough to put those promises into action?@@@Illegal warfare is the biggest challenge to this Organization.@@@There is no doubt that the unprovoked and, at its core, colonizing war that Russia has been waging against its neighbour.@@@Ukraine, a founding Member of the United Nations, is the most egregious, blatant and manifest violation of the prohibition of the illegal use of force since the creation of the United Nations.@@@For us to stand up together against that act of aggression means, most importantly, standing up for the international order.@@@That order is certainly the only security guarantee, especially for us, a small State, but also for the international community.@@@This Assembly is the bedrock of genuine multilateralism, based on the principle of sovereign equality.@@@As such, it has admirably lived up to the challenge that it was handed by the Security Council, paralysed by the use of the veto.@@@Together, we have called for the complete withdrawal of all Russian troops from Ukrainian territory.@@@Together, we defined the parameters for a just peace that we all want to 
see as soon as possible and, together, we made the legal determination that the actions by Russia against Ukraine amount to an act of aggression.@@@We have yet to take the next obvious step together: to ensure criminal accountability for that act of aggression for the individuals who ordered it, in line with international law.@@@We will continue our conversations with all present to enable us to achieve that.@@@That serves the goal of a just peace for Ukraine in accordance with the terms defined by us in this Assembly, but it will also have a catalytic effect of a far wider reach.@@@In ensuring criminal accountability for the most manifest violations of the United Nations Charter, we will also protect ourselves, in particular the small States among us, and our own sovereignty and territorial integrity.@@@Our international order is founded on the prohibition of the illegal use of force.@@@For that prohibition to be effective, it must be backed up by accountability and by the rule of law.@@@That, of course, is the task of the International Criminal Court, established 25 years ago, with competence over the most serious crimes under international law, the crime of aggression among them.@@@We must give the Court the competence to exercise full jurisdiction as quickly as possible so that it can fulfil its task with respect to the illegal use of force.@@@Aggression is a fundamental challenge to all of us who signed up to the United Nations Charter.@@@At its core, the United Nations is, and must continue to be, a peace organization.@@@For billions of individuals, this building embodies the promise that we will respond collectively to those that openly undermine peace and security.@@@That is why Liechtenstein joined this Organization more than three decades ago.@@@That is the pledge made to future generations in San Francisco, and it is the expectation that our people have.@@@The United Nations has evolved tremendously since its creation.@@@It has been the crucial force in advancing international law.@@@Its role as a provider of humanitarian assistance has become irreplaceable.@@@Its agencies and programmes carry out functions of enormous importance to individuals around the globe.@@@Yet its core mission is, and remains, the maintenance of peace and security, and that is the role that we are challenged to safeguard.@@@It is a difficult task.@@@It is a fact that the Security Council is often unable to act.@@@The deep political divisions among the permanent members are likely a reality for years to come.@@@The pernicious effects of the veto are being mitigated, but they persist, often with a devastating effect for the people affected.@@@Next year’s Summit of the Future is an essential collective test for all of us.@@@We must demonstrate our ability to find ways to ensure collective action when the Security Council fails in its tasks.@@@This Assembly will therefore have to play a central role in a new agenda for peace.@@@We can do more to bring the Security Council’s practice into line with the law to which we all subscribed when joining the United Nations.@@@We are proud to have presented to this Assembly the veto initiative, which ensures accountability and an institutional balance.@@@We should now focus on ensuring that those that are parties to a dispute do not participate in the decision-making on those disputes.@@@That is simply the law set out in the United Nations Charter, and its application has been neglected so far.@@@In recent years, climate change has occupied an increasingly central place in our discussions.@@@This Hall has seen summit meeting after summit meeting on that issue.@@@This year again, we are urgently reminded of the limited window that we have to address the climate crisis.@@@From weather extremes to sea level rise, all regions of the world are affected by climate change.@@@But those that have done the least to cause the crisis in the first place are the ones most affected.@@@We certainly are in the fight of our lives, as Secretary-General Guterres has said.@@@However, as we gather here, we are not on track to win that fight.@@@We hope to see significant progress at the twenty-eighth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change meeting, to be held in Abu Dhabi later this year.@@@But that alone will not be enough.@@@For climate change as well, the law must guide us.@@@That is why we have strongly supported the request for an advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on the question of climate change.@@@We are confident that the Court will help us to have clarity regarding the complex legal questions concerning climate change, and thus assist in our common fight against that most existential threat.@@@That initiative, led by Vanuatu, was yet another example of leadership by small States, a testament to genuine and effective multilateralism.@@@Small States like ourselves — and we are indeed a majority in this Assembly — need the United Nations.@@@But the United Nations also needs us, and now more so than ever.@@@It is we small States that automatically look beyond our national interests.@@@We understand that our success does not have to come at the cost of someone else’s loss.@@@We look for partnerships as a matter of course and as a way 
to success, and we work for the rule of law as a matter of enlightened self-interest.@@@At a time of competitive alliance-building, our ability and willingness to forge common ground are indispensable to the future success of the United Nations.@@@We can, and we will, play an important role in shaping the Summit of the Future.@@@The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development remains one of the most successful expressions of common ground from the past decade.@@@It plays an evermore important role in shaping Government policies, and it is deeply embedded in the consciousness of our people.@@@The SDGs may well be the most widely known agreement that the United Nations has reached in the past decades.@@@And yet, halfway through the implementation process, the picture is rather bleak.@@@The number of people living in extreme poverty is higher than before the coronavirus disease pandemic.@@@Hunger levels are back to those of 15 years ago.@@@At the current pace, full gender equality is not just decades away, but in fact centuries.@@@The lack of progress across our countries is mirrored in the difficulty to find political consensus on the way forward.@@@That negative trend needs to be reversed now.@@@The 2030 Agenda is the only global road map that we have to overcome the multiple crises that we face today.@@@Liechtenstein’s strong commitment to the SDGs is also reflected in its second voluntary national review, which I was honoured to present earlier this year.@@@Our official development assistance spending has been increased by 22 per cent in comparison to that of 2018.@@@That is meant to help to reverse the negative trends in the fields of poverty reduction, food security and access to education, as well as climate protection.@@@All Government bills are now evaluated against the Sustainable Development Goals.@@@Our commitment to the 2030 Agenda is a genuine expression of multilateralism, of which we need to see more.@@@Gender equality is a central part of that agenda.@@@We will not forget the countless women who suffer from violence and oppression worldwide.@@@We will continue to call out situations of systematic gender persecution, from Afghanistan to Iran.@@@We will continue to call for the empowerment of women and to support the bravery of women who stand up to demand political change, from Belarus to Myanmar.@@@We need women’s voices and active role in our national politics and in international leadership positions, in particular in peace operations.@@@The international community faces major challenges that will shape the future of us all.@@@As highlighted at the beginning, by signing the United Nations Charter, we have given future generations the promise that they will all have a prosperous future.@@@We can no longer afford to remain inactive and divided on key issues.@@@Therefore, we have to face difficult questions and different interests.@@@Even if solving such problems is not easy, we must never lose sight of the very main purpose of the United Nations, which is to ensure global peace.@@@That requires the contribution of all States, large and small.@@@The rule of law, democracy, social justice, tolerance and the ability to engage in dialogue are fundamental conditions for peace.@@@In the spirit of San Francisco.@@@Liechtenstein will continue to advocate strongly for those values within the international community.@@@It is indeed a particular honour and pleasure to speak on behalf of the citizens of the Republic of North Macedonia here in the heart of the United Nations at the general debate of the General Assembly.@@@At the outset, allow me to wish every success to Mr. Dennis Francis.@@@President of the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session.@@@Every year at this time, the eyes of the world turn towards the largest gathering at which the political leaders of nations elaborate on their visions for the future.@@@This year, the focus on all of us is perhaps greater than ever before because the lowest common denominator of the emotional state of humankind today is fear — fear of wars, famine, poverty, environmental disasters; fear for the future of our next of kin.@@@It is an undeniable fact that international order has been shaken to its core in various parts of the world.@@@The aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine continues with unabated and tireless ferocity, in flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations and of the principles of international law.@@@This is the biggest security crisis since the Second World War, with global consequences that are felt, more or less, on all continents.@@@With each passing day, the suffering of the Ukrainian people becomes greater, material goods are destroyed and the danger of escalation grows ever more imminent.@@@We most strongly condemn the aggression against Ukraine, as has been done by a great number of Members of our Organization.@@@We stand for the unconditional withdrawal of Russian occupying troops and respect for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders.@@@The Charter of this world Assembly is crystal clear in that regard — all open issues anywhere in the world must be resolved by peaceful means, with negotiations and dialogue and by renouncing the use of force.@@@The war in Ukraine is the most blatant but, unfortunately, not the only example of a threat against world peace and security.@@@The planetary security architecture, the basis of which is the Organization, is 
especially shaken when a State, a permanent member of the Security Council, illegally attacks another State Member of that same Organization.@@@It was no accident that the Secretary-General recently warned that the risk of a nuclear disaster is today at the highest level since the end of the Cold War.@@@That alert, coming from the highest level of the Organization, should be a wake-up call for all reasonable political leaders and for a global mobilization to preserve peace, which is undoubtedly the greatest value of humanity.@@@It is high time to silence the drums of war, to respect the Charter of the United Nations, guided by respect for the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of States as the fundamental principles and the main raison d’etre of the world Organization.@@@Peace is the fundament of everything.@@@However, the world is facing challenges of various kinds and addressing them requires not only peace among States, but also mutual trust and cooperation.@@@It is certain that trust, built throughout decades and mostly in this building, has been seriously undermined and that we will need time, effort and, above all, political will to reinstate it.@@@Independent of all differences among us — be they political, economic or cultural — we must act together in the interest of the peace, stability and prosperity of current and future generations.@@@The alternatives to dialogue among nations are frightening, and every delay will again lead us to the same threat, with the difference that the price to be paid then will be much higher.@@@The war in Ukraine creates a state of general unpredictability and a constant loop of crises, especially in food and energy supply.@@@The shortage of food supplies endangers the poorest and threatens to provoke humanitarian disasters with unprecedented magnitude in many parts of the world.@@@We give our full support to the efforts of the Secretary-General to restore the agreement for export of Ukrainian grain via the Black Sea, because we find it completely unacceptable to use food and energy as weapons for the realization of military or political objectives.@@@In parallel with the efforts to achieve the peaceful resolution of conflicts, it is necessary to redouble our efforts to realize the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.@@@The Sustainable Development Goals Summit held a few days ago on the sidelines of this year’s general debate is a step in the right direction, but it is crucial to turn words into actions.@@@It is beyond understanding that, in the third decade of the twenty- first century, millions of people are left with their basic human needs unmet.@@@What will our authority as political leaders be when we discuss democracy, human rights and prosperity, while at the same time millions of people do not have access to drinking water, food or education?@@@Global solidarity is not a novelty idea or a concept that needs special elaboration.@@@I myself come from Skopje, the capital of North Macedonia, which, exactly 60 years ago, was struck by a devastating earthquake.@@@Skopje rose from the ashes, among other things, thanks to global solidarity.@@@We learned the hard way how precious a hand extended in times of trouble is.@@@The devastating earthquake in Turkey in February brought us back to the very essence of humanism: vulnerability when faced with natural disasters, but also the primordial need of humans to help the weak and the suffering.@@@None of us knows what tomorrow will bring, but we do know that we will face all challenges far more efficiently if we use the mechanisms we have already built.@@@Along those lines, it is necessary to address the issue of climate change far more resolutely.@@@Those changes do not acknowledge or recognize borders; therefore, an efficient response absolutely requires joint action.@@@The region of South-East Europe, where I come from, is facing phenomena unknown to date: so-called supercell storms verging on tornadoes, which are a direct consequence of climate change.@@@Global warming, as the Secretary-General has said, is now becoming global boiling.@@@There is no doubt whatsoever that the world finds itself before an existential challenge, and a successful counter-response is possible only if we rally around a single, global platform.@@@The necessary instruments, such as the Climate Solidarity Pact, whereby developed economies provide financial and technical support to those in development have already been set; an equitable transition towards a green economy is possible, but only through their adequate implementation.@@@According to the Climate Action Acceleration Agenda, developed countries should not only achieve a level of zero net emissions by 2040, but also keep their promises to the countries in development by doubling the resources for adaptation and funding of the Green Climate Fund.@@@The greatest threats of the present — geopolitical turbulence, wars, terrorism, climate change and 
massive migration waves — are arising at a time when international organizations and the entire multilateral system are going through an identity or a functionality crisis, and most often, both.@@@The only real answer can be renewed and reinforced multilateralism that will value the individual needs of every country, but will also offer a clear vision of the big picture, of the things uniting us and of the greater good.@@@There is no better place for that joint endeavour than the United Nations.@@@One urgent need of humankind today is to restore predictability, early warning and prevention in international relations.@@@It is certain that a prerequisite to that are internal reforms of the United Nations system, with respect for the principle of greater representation and inclusiveness, in order to reflect the reality of the world today.@@@Moreover, it is necessary to establish mechanisms for better functionality while also reducing the options for paralysing the work of the Organization.@@@In that context, we offer our full support to the ministerial meeting convened in preparation for the Summit of the Future, to be held in 2024.@@@Of course, the need remains to solve old problems while addressing new challenges, although some, like fake news and cyberthreats, have already become part of our lives.@@@Some others, although of newer date, such as artificial intelligence, are already causing major changes in our lives.@@@There should be no doubt in our minds that without a joint pact for the future, no country or group of countries will have the potential to offer or implement responses to those challenges alone.@@@Since day one of our independence, more than 30 years ago, my country has been manifesting, in the best possible way, its attachment to the principles of peace, profound regional cooperation and the resolution of open issues by means of dialogue.@@@In 1991, we started a process of internal democratic maturation by affirming the rights of ethnic communities to the highest degree possible and fostering a culture of dialogue when resolving internal issues, but also in the relations with our neighbours.@@@We accepted compromise as a way of solving problems, not as an expression of weakness but, on the contrary, as an expression of self-confidence in our ability to protect our own interests without damaging the interests of others.@@@Respecting the principles that we believe in, we continue to make an active contribution to peace, stability, democratic values, sustainable development and economic prosperity.@@@This year, we hold the chairpersonship of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the largest regional security organization, at a time of unprecedented challenges.@@@Even in such conditions, we strive to maintain the relevance of the Organization, led by the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter and the Helsinki Final Act.@@@We remain among the biggest promoters of regional cooperation in South-East Europe, working at the same time on the fulfilment of the criteria for membership of the European Union, not later than 2030.@@@There is no doubt in our mind that strengthening the democratic institutions, in continuity and with the guaranteed equity of all citizens is the only possible way to a greater cohesion in a multiethnic society.@@@At the beginning of my statement.@@@I mentioned that fear of the future is perhaps the predominant feeling today.@@@However, that must not be accepted as normal.@@@We political leaders gathered here today have a responsibility to substitute that feeling of fear with one of hope and faith in a more just world.@@@A precondition to that is to achieve, as soon as possible, a renewed agreement for respecting the fundamental values and humanistic ideals for which the Organization was established seventy-eight years ago.@@@The President of the Republic of Nicaragua.@@@Comandante Daniel Ortega Saavedra, and Vice-President Rosario Murillo Zambrana send the following message to the General Assembly and the world.@@@“The people of Nicaragua salute the peoples represented in the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session, with our heads held high, as always, because we have managed to survive and overcome all the tragedies and catastrophes imposed by a history of domination, cruelty, intervention, occupation and interference in all aspects of our 
life, including our electoral processes, subverted by the empires and their economic and military might, with which they have tried to destroy us and dominate us.@@@“We are living at a time of the extinction of the imperialist, colonialist model of looting and genocide, whose greed has impacted nature and our world — a world of many patrimonies, languages and steadfast ways of life.@@@In these times of decision and conviction of the need for substantive change in order to recover all our rights and values in the face of the overwhelming criminal greed of colonialism and imperialism in all their manifestations.@@@Nicaragua continues to engage in all battles for genuine freedom, for light and for truth that cannot be concealed.@@@“We are the immense and invincible force of a courageous new world of peoples who do not let themselves be cut off from hope or faith, and who, with our growing spiritual strength, demand respectful cooperation, solidarity and human fraternity, such that everything can change and be transformed and we can live peacefully and securely, working and prospering in our own sacred lands, in shared destiny and prosperity.@@@“This world that has now stood up; that has started to make its way, claiming its own voice and identity, its ancestral and current knowledge; this world of a culture of peace has spoken at this seventy-eighth session of the General Assembly, shall continue, with increasing self-assurance and certainty, to sow, cultivate and harvest the indispensable transformations, even in these very United Nations, whose nature has been distorted and transformed, unfortunately, into a body servile to and dependent on the Powers that be.@@@“The new world that belongs to us all demands respect.@@@It demands peace.@@@It insists upon peace.@@@It demands justice for everyone.@@@It demands remembrance, history, reparation and non-repetition.@@@That is why, from this rostrum, we demand that the United Nations enforce the mandate of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which in 1986 sentenced the United States of America to indemnify Nicaragua, at least in part, for the costs of the destruction, permanent aggression, pain and suffering endured by hundreds of thousands of families during the insane and vengeful war imposed on our country and our people, in what was called the “counterrevolution”.@@@“That, of course, does not restore lives; it does not heal the broken hearts of so many families and individuals, but at least it rebuilds, for all Nicaraguans, the economic, social, productive, cultural infrastructure that those responsible shattered with their grotesque intervention, but which, as always and every time, was defeated by the honour, integrity and glory of Nicaragua’s spirit, by the grace of God.@@@“Sandino lives.@@@Sandino lives in each of those victories over nefarious and diabolical imperialism, and Sandino is in this Hall today, demanding that all of us comply with and enforce the law and international law to indemnify the Nicaraguan people with what they deserve in all justice and truth, after having forcefully asserted the right to peace and life, claiming what belongs to us — sovereignty, freedom and harmony — to make our way with our own destinies.@@@We demand that the United Nations speak up and order the Government of the United States of America to comply with the historic judgment that condemned and obliged it to recognize Nicaragua, and to abide by it in all its commendable provisions.@@@“Nicaragua, with the dignity and heroism of our struggles, races, peoples, cultures and balanced life, demands that closure and joins in the call of all the peoples and countries that have spoken from this rostrum to denounce the aggressive, interventionist, arbitrary, unjust policies whose coercive, unilateral measures are not only illegal and illegitimate, but constitute a destabilizing, destructive, warlike modality that imposes changes of Government through coups d’etat, attempts to incite coups and acts of vandalism known these days as “colour revolutions”, causing grief to so many families among so many peoples.@@@“We stand in permanent solidarity with the peoples and countries that experience the uncivilized barbarism that recapitulates the tides and echoes of the imperialist, colonialist, fascist models that have caused the deaths of millions of human beings, imposing regimes of terror and deprivation, with shameful waves and unprecedented tsunamis of migration.@@@Those tragedies trace the desperation 
of injustice and the neocolonial project to silence, dominate and exclude so as to continue plundering the wealth of the world’s peoples.@@@Entire countries have been destroyed in that brutal scorched-earth policy, which seeks to satisfy the beastly appetites of the Earth’s imperialists.@@@Entire countries have been occupied and their peoples sacrificed and massacred under the same atrocious policies and actions, in violation of all rights, which only reinforces what we know and denounce again here as hate crimes.@@@“We express our permanent and combative solidarity with the Palestinian people, the Syrian people, the Sahrawi people, the Eritrean people and people in all those places where they have sought to create fascist and neo-Nazi enclaves.@@@We express our permanent and combative solidarity with all the struggling peoples of Africa.@@@Asia and Latin America.@@@We are peoples and countries that resist and fight the blockades, the economic warfare and the systematic and permanent intervention in the social, cultural, economic and political life of all our institutions as we witness more and more violations of all rights.@@@“We express our combative solidarity with the people of Cuba, of Marti, of Fidel, of Raul and of Miguel Diaz-Canel over 62 years of murderous blockade.@@@We express our combative solidarity with the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, where Chavez lives on, the struggle goes on and Nicolas has defeated all destructive assaults.@@@‘We express our combative solidarity with the peoples and Governments of our Central American region that do not falter in the struggle for security and peace so as to confront and conquer the hell of poverty.@@@To Honduras and its brave President Xiomara Castro Sarmiento — Honduras, our fraternal neighbour, where Morazan and Sandino prevail — we offer our familial, fraternal embrace in unflagging solidarity.@@@“We express our combative solidarity with Bolivia, the great people of Tupac Katari, who are moving onward amidst the same old threats; with the people of Argentina and their sovereign right over the Malvinas Islands; and with Puerto Rico, brave and unstoppable in its struggle for independence.@@@“Our strength is with the People’s Republic of China, the Power that today is showing the world and the human family how solidarity, respectful cooperation, generous brotherhood and sisterhood are practiced and lived among older brothers and sisters, younger brothers and sisters, but all as one big family with a common destiny, as we fight to overcome the actions of dispossession, economic stagnation and poverty imposed on so many people.@@@‘We express our active and combative solidarity with the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea in its historical battles for sovereignty and rights.@@@To the people of Belarus, always dignified and in solidarity, we offer our respect and recognition.@@@“We express our solidarity and combative force with the heroic struggles waged by the Russian Federation for peace and security, for a world that we must all defend from the growing threats of empires and their neo-Nazi policies, their fascist emblems and slogans, which seek to return us to the unwonted perversion of wars of expansion and domination, and which have left millions of dead and families destroyed all over the world.@@@Our support for the Russian Federation is an unwavering support and an inescapable human alliance for the security, dialogue and harmony that are essential and irreplaceable for the human community.@@@“We express our solidarity and support with the Islamic Republic of Iran, another example of sharing and coexisting with peoples ravaged by imperial greed.@@@Despite the incessant, excessive and infernal arrogance of those who think they are superior, we reaffirm that they do not separate us and together we travel along paths of courage and dignity.@@@“We demand from this place respect for the United Nations system in order to restore its founding values, in this other world where we learn, keep ourselves abreast and continue, yes, to defend just, sovereign, self-defined models based on the maxim “Respect for the rights of others is peace”.@@@As Eternal Comandante Hugo Chavez Frias told the General Assembly in 2005, the United Nations must be re-founded.@@@That was taken up again by Nicaragua’s Foreign Minister of Dignity.@@@Father Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann, who also served as President of the General Assembly, when in 2008 he raised the urgency of re-founding the United Nations to serve the world’s peoples.@@@“The United Nations has just held a meeting of Heads of State and Government of the Group of 77 and China in Cuba, which reached agreements of fundamental importance for the world—agreements that must be taken into account and fulfilled so that, with a consciousness of freedom and of the brotherhood and sisterhood of the human family, we continue to break the chains of slavery and dependence, of submission and subordination, of servile obedience that the selfish, ambitious and perfidious colonial and imperial interests intend, even at this point in history, to continue imposing on us.@@@“We regard with hope the recent meeting and enlargement of the BRICS grouping, which today with Brazil.@@@Russia.@@@India.@@@China and South Africa, in addition to Argentina.@@@Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates.@@@Egypt.@@@Ethiopia and Iran, represent new forces and strength in the struggles for our economic and financial sovereignty as free and capable peoples.@@@“In the face of all the advances in science, techniques and technologies, including those portentously called “artificial intelligence” — as if they were not the result of human intelligence — Nicaragua demands the full participation of the peoples who have made those advances of the conquistadors possible with our blood and resources.@@@We demand what is ours — the right to fully enjoy this development, improving the conditions of work, study and life of our peoples, with all their rights.@@@In addition to inclusion.@@@Nicaragua also proposes the rational and beneficial use of those resources of humankind, which in the hands of the same malevolent actors as always, constitute weapons of mass destruction against countries, peoples and communities.@@@“‘Always together and always moving forward’”, as Sandino would say, with proposals based on respect, consideration, fraternity and a nation for everyone.@@@Nicaragua joins the intense search for, and struggle to protect our inheritance of natural resources, our cultures, our languages and ways of life and our original communities, working daily and tirelessly for peace, which is not only a right, but an urgent necessity for the survival of humankind — that is, for the life we all deserve.@@@The aggressions that they arrogantly and haughtily call “sanctions” do not define or intimidate us, nor do they disable us, nor do they bend us, nor do they lead us to sell out or surrender.@@@We do not know the word “surrender”.@@@I repeat — the aggressions that they arrogantly and haughtily call “sanctions” do not define or intimidate us, nor do they disable us, nor do they bend us, nor do they lead us to sell out or surrender.@@@We do not know the word “surrender”.@@@“Life is made up of daily struggles to assert what belongs to us — a world free of wars, of chemical or nuclear weapons, of looting, ignorance, fraud, of new deceptions and brazen thefts, including the assault on our talents; a world free of offences, because war, looting, the poverty they generate, misery, pandemics, the lack of health care, education, housing and the lack of favourable conditions for life all constitute an offensive, disparaging, humiliating, cruel, degrading and immense prison where human security is denied, promoting seas of exoduses bereft of dignity and cutting off hope, joy, culture and life for the majority of the planet.@@@“What belongs to us is a world free of brutality and aggression; a world free of arrogance; a world free of supreme ignorance; a world free of hatred, evil and misery; a world free of sadness and emotional poison; a world free of the deformations, apathy and depression intentionally created by drugs, which have become another form of terrorism, among so many other perversions and provocations that plague us.@@@“What belongs to us is a world free of impositions; a world of vigour, courage and values; a world committed to a simple, powerful, forceful common good — love, which is stronger than hatred and conquers everything and is capable of everything; love, which we so sorely need to build trust so as definitively install new horizons and prodigious futures.@@@We want a world of spiritual beings who are also human, who are not perfect but who can and should close ranks to recover the goodness and strength of this planet that we share.@@@“Above and beyond all the forms of terrorism imposed upon us, there is the spirit, the flame, the insignia and the axiom of our human condition.@@@That is what we are fighting for.@@@That is why we win.@@@That is why we will overcome.@@@We are forever moving forward.”@@@It is my honour to address the General Assembly on behalf of the Arab Republic of Egypt and to demonstrate its voice and vision, as a representative of a noble country that has made civilizational contributions throughout history and plays an essential role in promoting regional and international peace and stability.@@@Egypt was one of the first countries to join the United Nations and contributed to establishing the goals and principles upon which the Organization was founded.@@@For decades.@@@Egypt has been fully committed to the Charter of the United Nations, the promotion of international peace and prosperity and the achievement of sustainable development.@@@However, our world today faces a persistent question: how effective is the multilateral system in grappling with current challenges?@@@Many discussions have been held regarding the development of this international Organization, especially after developing countries, including Egypt, found themselves grappling with cascading and interlocking crises in which they have no stake and without adequate support from the international organizations created to support their legitimate development aspirations and achieve global economic stability.@@@Having said that.@@@I would like to share with the General Assembly the Egyptian vision, which sheds light on a number of priorities seeking to restore trust in and the efficiency of multilateral action.@@@First, in a world mainly characterized by interdependence and globalization, no one is secure unless everyone is secure, and no region is stable unless all regions are stable.@@@Our collective security lies in our joint action and in the effective application of the principles of the Charter, rather than selectivity and double standards.@@@The challenges that are facing our world, given their complexity, interrelatedness and diversity, such as conflicts, food insecurity, pervasive terrorism and the inability of the international system to find sustained solutions for them, emphasize that we are still far from realizing the purposes and principles of the Charter.@@@The serious repercussions of the conflict in Ukraine have proved that we cannot guarantee the stability and security of any party without the other, and that settling disputes is the responsibility of all States and not the responsibility of only influential parties.@@@Thus.@@@Egypt has taken active steps with her Arab and African neighbours, including by creating the Arab Ministerial Contact Group on the Crisis in Ukraine and participating in the African leaders’ initiative, to put an end to the bloodshed and to find a peaceful settlement for the Russian-Ukrainian crisis.@@@Secondly, the international multilateral system in the post-Second-World-War era has revealed a structural deficiency in the way we address political, economic, social and security global crises.@@@That deficiency mainly entailed the monopoly by major Powers of the ability to make international decisions and their disregard for the aspirations of hundreds of millions of peoples and communities.@@@In that regard.@@@Egypt and the African countries insist on the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration, with a view to undoing the historic injustice done to our continent by expanding the African representation in the Security Council and securing two permanent seats for Africa with full prerogatives.@@@Egypt has also supported the joint action mechanisms among developing countries and was at the forefront of efforts to found the groupings of those countries.@@@We look forward to playing an active role through our new membership in the BRICS group — Brazil.@@@Russia.@@@India.@@@China and South Africa — advocating for the interests and aspirations of 30 per cent of the global economy in the countries of the South that have the human wealth of young people to offer.@@@Thirdly, we are in dire need of restoring trust in the economic tools of the global system, with a view to enabling it to address the urgent development aspirations of peoples.@@@The best way to prevent conflicts is through comprehensive and sustainable development.@@@That makes it incumbent upon us to uphold the role of international organizations in supporting developing countries in facing ongoing international crises and promoting resilience against international future crises.@@@In that regard, it is essential that the international community synergize its efforts, take constructive steps to reform the current global financial structure and develop the current international financial system in such a way as to enable developing countries to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).@@@That requires establishing effective and innovative financing tools and promoting existing financing tools, including special drawing rights of the International Monetary Fund.@@@That also calls on us to look into the best ways of allocating them, in addition to modifying the practices of multilateral development banks in order to realize three goals: increasing the amount of funds; providing funds from different sources and tools such as concessional loans and grants; and improving developing countries’ access to those development banks for achieving development in line with the national priorities of those countries.@@@It is high time to reform the World Trade Organization and to consolidate its centrality in maximizing the returns of the rules-based multilateral trading system.@@@If we wish to accelerate the achievement of the SDGs, then we should take immediate steps to prevent global debt crises that not only exacerbate the weak economies of poor countries and increase 
challenges for developing economies but will cause a greater global economic crisis.@@@We must, therefore, take immediate steps to address that crisis by way of creating sustainable and comprehensive mechanisms to address the debts of low- and middle-income countries.@@@We must also address the increase in the debt burden and complexity of its global structure while changing patterns of indebtedness, promoting cooperation with development partners for debt exchange and establishing development projects.@@@That will eventually transform the challenges of debt into an opportunity for a just transition to a green economy.@@@Fourthly, the world is facing the existential threat of climate change.@@@Climate disasters such as devastating floods, deadly hurricanes or continuous drought have become part of our daily life.@@@International reports stress that the world is not on track to address the climate challenge, especially with respect to adequate financing for developing countries to support the implementation of their national pledges.@@@In that regard, given Egypt’s conviction of the importance of moving from planning to implementation, we succeeded, at the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP27) in Sharm el-Sheikh, in mobilizing international consensus to achieve climate justice.@@@We reached balanced decisions there, based on the agreed responsibilities and principles as per the Convention and the Paris Agreement.@@@Moreover, as an international community, we achieved historic progress by securing funds for developing countries to confront climate-change-related losses and damage and established a track towards a just transformation in development.@@@We also focused on the expanded use of renewable energy.@@@As President of COP27, we note that current efforts are not up to the existing challenge.@@@We also note that certain countries have reneged on their responsibilities, while others have even reneged on their pledges in terms of implementing agreed pledges.@@@Some countries have imposed protective measures and fees under the pretext of climate change.@@@Therefore, to achieve success at COP28 in the sisterly United Arab Emirates.@@@I would like to stress that our success relies upon implementing the pledges and existing agreements, especially by establishing a fund that provides financing for developing countries to face losses and damage and the financing necessary to achieve the goal of the 1.5°C limit.@@@Fifthly, our vision for developing this international system should take into consideration newer challenges such as the scarcity of natural resources, including drinking water, which was the lifeline of nearly 1 billion people at the beginning of last century.@@@Today we need an adequate amount of drinking water for approximately 8 billion people.@@@That is why we welcome the outcomes of the historic United Nations 2023 Water Conference.@@@In that regard.@@@I would like to highlight my country’s acute water scarcity.@@@Egypt is at the top list of arid countries that receive less rain than others in the world.@@@Egypt’s population exceeds 105 million people.@@@That has led to a sharp decrease in the per capita quota of water and an annual water deficit of more than 50 per cent.@@@That compels us to reuse the limited amount of available water more than once and import proxy water in the form of food imports to the tune of nearly $15 billion annually.@@@Egypt depends on the Nile River for 98 per cent of its water and is very vulnerable to any unsustainable use of the river’s water.@@@Here.@@@I would like to stress our unwavering position, which is based on international law.@@@We reject any unilateral measures regarding the management of transboundary water — for example, the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, which was built without consultation, adequate prior analysis or study of the impacts on the riparian States.@@@Ethiopia has gone further by unilaterally filling and operating that dam, thus explicitly violating the principles of international law, the 2015 Declaration of Principles on the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam and the 2021 Security Council presidential statement (S/PRST/2021/18).@@@Notwithstanding those unilateral practices on the part of our brothers in Ethiopia.@@@Egypt is keen to engage seriously in the current negotiations, which have been ongoing for more than one decade, with a view to reaching a binding agreement on the rules concerning the filling and operating of the Dam that takes into account the interests of all involved.@@@We continue to work sincerely with Ethiopia to reach an agreement that takes into consideration the interests of Egypt, the Sudan and Ethiopia.@@@It would be wrong to believe that we would accept a de facto situation concerning more than 100 million Egyptians.@@@Sixthly, one of the pillars of efforts to reform this international system is enabling it to promote human rights at the political, economic, social and cultural levels, far from politicization and double standards.@@@There is an attempt to impose certain concepts that do not respect cultural and social peculiarities.@@@I wonder: how is one system of values morally superior to others?@@@We warn against the phenomena of racism, xenophobia.@@@Islamophobia and its manifestations, including increased violence and hatred against Muslim communities.@@@Most notable among those manifestations was the recent burning of the Holy Quran, as that is a violation of freedom of religion and faith.@@@Laws, policies and programmes must be established to prevent the recurrence of such incidents.@@@We commend the recent Danish initiative in that regard.@@@We also believe in the established principles and the responsibility of the State and its institutions and of communities to promote human rights.@@@At the national level.@@@Egypt has made strides in promoting the rights of its citizens, most notably by launching the national human rights strategy, the strategy for the empowerment of Egyptian women and the strategy to combat violence against women.@@@Moreover.@@@Egypt has made tireless efforts to empower youth and persons with disabilities.@@@Egypt also gives priority to the principle of citizenship, the fight against discrimination and the protection of religious freedoms.@@@Seventh, the United Nations was created to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war and to create an Organization based on noble principles.@@@Despite that, the world has, over the past 78 years, witnessed wars and conflicts that have claimed the lives of millions of innocent people.@@@However, that should not make us lose faith in those principles.@@@We must acknowledge the failure in implementing them and in applying policies that contradict those principles.@@@Since we believe in them.@@@Egypt has sought for half a century to be a pillar of stability, security and development.@@@It was the first to make peace in the Middle East.@@@Currently, we are concerned about the deteriorating situation in the Palestinian territories due to the practices of the occupying forces, which endanger the situation, following the recent summits held in Aqaba and Sharm el-Sheikh.@@@Egypt stresses its position in support of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people to establish an independent State based on the 4 June 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital, in line with resolutions of international legitimacy.@@@We call on all peace-loving Powers to seize the opportunities available to salvage the two-State solution and achieve a just and comprehensive peace.@@@Egypt is also working towards establishing peace in the Sudan.@@@Libya.@@@Syria and Yemen, according to the principles of international law and resolutions of international legitimacy.@@@Egypt supports counterterrorism efforts on our continent.@@@Africa, through a comprehensive approach in line with the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy.@@@We intend to intensify our efforts during our co-chairmanship of the Global Counterterrorism Forum.@@@Cairo has launched a summit for the countries neighbouring the Sudan, with a view to coordinating their efforts to settle the current crisis and to mitigate the humanitarian repercussions thereof.@@@We are also working towards a lasting ceasefire with full respect for the Sudan’s sovereignty and the preservation of State institutions.@@@The Sudan’s neighbouring countries continue their efforts to reach a sustainable political solution.@@@Egypt supports a Libyan political solution that is in accordance with the principles of national ownership and moves the country out of the transitional period, with the holding of presidential and parliamentary elections as soon as possible.@@@Egypt also stresses the importance of the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of all foreign forces and mercenaries from Libya within a time-bound period.@@@Egypt reiterates its categorical rejection of any bypassing of the legislative role of the Libyan Parliament.@@@We have reservations regarding any alternative solutions that eliminate the role of Libyan legislators.@@@Egypt adheres to the mandate of the legislative authority pursuant to the constitutional declaration and the 2015 Libyan political agreement of Skhirat in order to lead the Libyan dialogue towards ending the transitional phase in the country.@@@In conclusion, our vision is to restore trust in this multilateral Organization by upholding the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the rules of the international law, and maximizing the role of international organizations, chief among which is the United Nations.@@@It is my pleasure at the outset to express my congratulations to His Excellency Ambassador Dennis Francis on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session and to wish him every success.@@@I should like also to thank his predecessor.@@@His Excellency Mr. Csaba Korosi, for the outstanding manner in which he steered the work of the General Assembly at its previous session.@@@Furthermore.@@@I wish to commend the valuable efforts made by His Excellency the Secretary-General.@@@Mr. Antonio Guterres, to strengthen the role played by the United Nations to achieve its objectives.@@@Our world today is experiencing various acute interlinked crises whose negative effects are affecting everyone, although to varying degrees.@@@Our fates are interconnected, and we therefore need to accelerate the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030 pursuant to our collective commitment to that end.@@@There is no doubt that the pace and the degree of inclusivity of that implementation have so far been below our expectations due to the diversity of current challenges.@@@Globally speaking, the progress made so far, in particular in developing countries, is slowing down and experiencing difficulties.@@@That is reflected in the worsening levels of poverty and unemployment, the acute public-health and food crises and inflation, which could lead to economic recession and greater violence, terrorism and destructive armed conflicts, all of that accompanied by environmental degradation of our planet.@@@However, as grim as that picture is, we remain hopeful about the implementation of the SDGs, which depends on our collective capacity to chart new courses for multilateral cooperation and rectify the imbalance in the development assistance system so as to create more effective mechanisms for providing the funding needed to finance sustainable development.@@@The seventy-eighth session of the General Assembly is of utmost importance, as it allows us to carry out a midterm review of the implementation of the SDGs and to discuss means to accelerate the process.@@@We in the Islamic Republic of Mauritania have made the implementation of the SDGs the focus of our development efforts, as reflected in our accelerated growth and prosperity strategy, which is the framework for our public action for development.@@@Thanks to our considerable efforts and despite the unfavourable regional and international circumstances, we were able to improve many SDG-related indicators in my country.@@@We have fought poverty, vulnerability and exclusion.@@@We have created a broad network for social protection so as to strengthen the resilience of our most vulnerable citizens, increase their purchasing power and expand medical and social coverage so as to progressively achieve universal health coverage.@@@We further undertook structural reforms in order to build a diversified economy that is more resilient and better able to create jobs and add value.@@@We have also strengthened economic, financial and monetary governance in my country by increasing the productivity of sectors such as agriculture, fisheries and animal husbandry so as to achieve food security and self-sufficiency.@@@Thanks to those reforms, economic growth in Mauritania reached 6.4 per cent last year.@@@Access to basic services also improved, and access to health-care services has broadened.@@@The percentage of the population with access to drinking water reached 72.33 per cent and with access to electricity 91.84 per cent in urban areas and 53 per cent on average throughout the country.@@@The share of renewable energy was 34 per cent in 2020, and we are aiming for 50 per cent by 2030.@@@Energy diversification has broadened in Mauritania thanks to our recently launched programme for the development of green hydrogen energy, which provides us with an alternative and sustainable source of clean energy.@@@That will help us to achieve the objective of an 11 per cent drop in carbon emissions.@@@The twenty-eighth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, set to take place in the United Arab Emirates, is for us a source of great hope.@@@We call on industrialized States to honour the commitments that they undertook in the area of greenhouse-gas emissions and those that they made during the Paris summit.@@@Our efforts in the area of energy transition are accompanied by a continued fight against desertification and other forms of climate change, with a view to restoring the balance of our ecosystems.@@@We are doing so in the context of the Great Green Wall initiative and the Permanent Interstate Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel, thereby strengthening the green economy.@@@We also are investing in our human capital.@@@We have implemented various youth training programmes to make it easier for young people to enter the labour market and to protect them against extremism and fundamentalism.@@@We have also launched programmes aimed at the empowerment of women and at strengthening their participation in the country’s political and public life.@@@Numerous promising reforms are also under way in the area of education so as to create a republican schooling system that gives all our children a high- quality education and equal opportunities.@@@Furthermore, we are actively working on strengthening the rule of law, good governance, social cohesion and individual and collective freedom.@@@We are ensuring the promotion of human rights and the rights of women and children, and we are fighting both contemporary and old forms of slavery.@@@We have seen positive results in all of those areas, acknowledged by our partners and specialized international bodies.@@@In all aspects of our public policy, we rely on dialogue and openness with all parties.@@@We undertook an in-depth reform of our judicial system to strengthen the independence of our judiciary and to guarantee the separation of powers.@@@Those reforms have strengthened our rule of law, democratic system and transparency.@@@That would have been impossible without the security and stability that reign throughout the country, despite the fact that the regional and international environments are currently particularly unstable.@@@Our integrated security strategy was also praised by all stakeholders.@@@We have contributed to the stability and security of the subregion through the Group of Five for the Sahel, which we are currently chairing.@@@We are also contributing to the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic and are hosting more than 100.000 of our Malian brothers who found refuge in Mauritania in the wake of the instability in their country.@@@Our efforts to achieve regional and international peace and stability are part and parcel of our foreign policy, which is based on good-neighbourliness, mutual respect, constructive cooperation, dialogue, negotiations, adherence to international treaties and support for just causes.@@@In that regard.@@@I would like to reaffirm the right of the Palestinian people to create an independent State with East Jerusalem as its capital, in keeping with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and the Arab Peace Initiative.@@@We also support solutions aimed at preserving territorial integrity, stability and security in Libya.@@@Yemen and Syria.@@@We call for the deployment of all possible efforts to effectively and sustainably put an end to the hostilities in the Republic of the Sudan and to reach a comprehensive political solution in that brotherly country.@@@We also stand with the Government of Somalia in its efforts to attain security and stability.@@@We reiterate our firm position on the conflict in Western Sahara.@@@We support the efforts being made by the United Nations as well as all Security Council resolutions aimed at finding a lasting solution that is acceptable to all.@@@We strongly condemn the phenomenon of Islamophobia, which distorts Islam and sows division and hatred between Muslims and the West in particular.@@@We would like to express our concern as regards the continued war in Ukraine.@@@We call for a negotiated solution that takes into account the concerns of various parties, with respect for international law and the Charter of the United Nations.@@@We reject all forms of power grab through non-constitutional means, and call on sisterly Sahel countries that experienced military coups to rapidly return to the constitutional order.@@@We are well aware that a great deal remains to be done in order to attain the SDGs.@@@We in Mauritania need financial resources that are far greater than what we can mobilize domestically.@@@Our situation is similar to that of most developing States and African States in particular.@@@That is why the easing of the debt burden of those countries, heightening the level of investment and upholding the commitments undertaken by partners could have helped us to collectively achieve better results.@@@That is why we call for a resolution to the issue of debt by reforming the development debt system and increasing support for the least developed countries, which are the most vulnerable, through multilateral cooperation, which should be strengthened.@@@Our Organization is the institutional embodiment of our common destiny and of the need to cooperate and ensure solidarity so as to meet common challenges while upholding our shared values.@@@We therefore need to work together so as to continue reforming the Organization.@@@We must work until its approach to international crises becomes more balanced, fairer and more considerate of the needs of the least developed countries.@@@That would strengthen the trust that everyone should have in the United Nations and in its effectiveness so as to bring about international peace and security and achieve the SDGs.@@@Today marks one year since I last appeared before the General Assembly (see A/77/PV.5) as the first female President of the Republic of Honduras, an event that emerged from the resistance in the streets and the fight against the coup d’etat that defeated the democratically elected president.@@@Jose Manuel Zelaya Rosales.@@@My Government’s progress and results have already been recognized by the international community and financial organizations: greater economic growth, public finances salvaged through the elimination of corrupt trusts, a single treasury, fiscal discipline, the timely payment of the burdensome debt and decreased inflation and country risk.@@@Together with the National Congress, we repealed the Secrets Law, an instrument of corruption of the previous regime.@@@We repealed the Employment and Economic Development Zone Law, that divided the territory into 17 pieces and gave them to 25 economic groups.@@@In terms of security, we have already achieved a significant reduction in extortion, homicides and violence through the Solution Against Crime programme, the intervention of detention centres and the state of emergency.@@@To my gratuitous detractors.@@@I should also point out for the record that the greatest increase in the budget of the social sectors has been ordered, with a view to reducing poverty and promoting health, education and school meals for all children in primary school.@@@We have also brought back the historic free tuition programme, fuel subsidies and free energy for the poorest, implemented massive bonuses for agricultural production, repaired 12.000 abandoned schools, ensured productive roads in all the municipalities of Honduras, repaired the road network and begun the construction of eight new hospitals.@@@In 2022, the previous President of Honduras was accused by the United States of conspiracy, of organizing the trafficking of thousands of tons of drugs for a decade, and of leading a criminal organization that included various figures from the underworld and State authorities, such as mayors, ministers, deputies, generals and police chiefs, some of whom have already been sentenced.@@@Those assailants who took the State hostage now conspire against my Government.@@@They are organized in an alliance of corrupt politicians and supposed civil society with the aim of stopping the proposed structural changes that the people ordered me to carry out at the polls.@@@They are the same people who murdered Morazan.@@@Today they oppose the approval of the Tax Justice Law and are boycotting the election of the new Attorney General to perpetuate the impunity to which they are accustomed and to hinder the arrival of the international commission to combat corruption and impunity.@@@It is impossible to understand the magnitude of the tragedy suffered by the majority of the Honduran people and the constant caravans of emigrants that arrive in the United States if we deny the 13 years of 
dictatorship overseen by the international community, which multiplied the country’s debt by six and saw the country reach a 74 per cent poverty rate — the highest in the history of Honduras.@@@The Honduran people, in their noble aspiration for justice, have vehemently mandated that I combat and dismantle the narco-State and the public-private corruption that looted and destroyed institutions, corrupted the popular will with electoral fraud and imposed State terrorism with death squads.@@@Popular support has been demonstrated in the recent mobilizations of popular resistance at the national level, with hundreds of thousands of grateful men and women who have expressed their support for our fight for the return to the rule of law and the restitution of dignity to the Honduran people and the presidency of the Republic.@@@On Monday.@@@18 September, upon my arrival in New York, after participating in the Group of 77 and China summit in Havana.@@@Cuba, in line with the commitment subscribed in my plan of Government and in accordance with the memorandum of understanding signed with the United Nations in 2022.@@@I gave the Secretary-General the official proposal for an agreement to establish the International Commission Against Corruption and Impunity for Honduras, which is impartial, autonomous and independent with the capacity to investigate and prosecute cases of high-impact corruption networks and financial crimes.@@@That is the only way to clean up a State where public institutions, the pirates of the political class and public-private partnerships have been infiltrated by organized crime.@@@Next year I will assume the pro tempore presidency of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) and the Central American Integration System (SICA).@@@That includes all the great homeland dreamed up by the liberators and those of us who fought for the unity of South America, the Caribbean.@@@Central America and Mexico.@@@Today I propose to open spaces for dialogue among us to formulate proposals to solve the challenges facing our region.@@@We are not only one of the most unequal and poorest regions, but also one of the regions with the lowest economic growth and technological backwardness, which affects our ability to address the threats we are facing.@@@Only by supporting each other will we be able to move forward.@@@We must not forget our brothers and sisters in Haiti.@@@The humanitarian crisis of an oppressed and revolutionary nation deserves our full support and solidarity.@@@At the third summit of the European Union and CELAC, held in July.@@@I clearly stated Honduras’ views on international issues, which, as I have stated in the General Assembly, require an urgent solution.@@@And as for SICA and Central America.@@@I would like to state how important it is to strengthen the integration process, which has seen sluggish development over the past 30 years.@@@We must express therefore a genuine political will that allows us to advance the customs union, social and environmental policies and the safe transit of people and their goods.@@@Today the great economic interests are confronting each other in the war in Ukraine.@@@In the end, the most affected are always the poorest countries and peoples of the world, who are suffering from inflation, food shortages and high fuel prices.@@@The military industrial complex consumes the majority of the budgets of developed countries with trillions and trillions of dollars, but that is in contrast with the indifference and inability to contribute to humankind and to the protection of nature.@@@The world of Bretton Woods has hit rock bottom, and we must now recognize that at the current pace we will not achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and secure sufficient financing for climate adaptation.@@@It is not an issue of taking steps, but of proposing changes to the economic system that require a deep commitment to humankind and nature.@@@There is no such invisible hand.@@@There is no spillover.@@@Practice teaches us that the application of global capitalism and the neoliberal model creates only misery, inequality and a crazy individualism of consumer societies in the face of enormous deprivation for billions of people.@@@The war in Ukraine must come to an end.@@@All humankind must to find a way to achieve peace.@@@We cannot live with the permanent threat of a conflict that will put an end to our planet.@@@It is important to put an end to the practice of sanctions, piracy and the confiscation of the assets of one nation by another.@@@We cannot talk about a civilized world when we live with the risk of being embargoed and having our reserves frozen in foreign banks, as is currently happening to Venezuela, whose assets have been confiscated, violating all the norms of international law.@@@The General Assembly every year demands the end of the blockade against Cuba, owing to it being an arbitrary and obsolete measure that is contrary to international law, violates the principle of respect for the self-determination of peoples and sacrifices a noble people who, despite the limitations imposed on them, continue to contribute to the world’s solidarity.@@@We condemn the long and cruel blockade against Cuba and Venezuela.@@@We also demand the removal of Cuba from the list of terrorist countries, as that is a distorted, bogus and capricious measure.@@@Similarly, the unjust measures and sanctions against Nicaragua must be eliminated, because they are barriers that prevent us from normalizing our relations with that fraternal country.@@@I believe in a multipolar world, where exchange and cooperation for development is based on the principles of independence, sovereignty and non-interference.@@@On the basis of those principles, a couple of months ago.@@@I officially opened relations with the People’s Republic of China.@@@Similarly, we have reached out to financial organizations and new initiatives for us, such as the Andean Development Corporation, of which we are already a member, and the administration of the New Development Bank of the BRICS group of countries — Brazil.@@@Russia.@@@India.@@@China and South Africa.@@@I would like to reiterate, as I did at the CELAC-@@@European Union summit, the vehement call for the freedom of Julian Assange, a faithful defender of free expression, a principle that we must all defend.@@@In defence of the indigenous peoples who fight for the land and the rivers.@@@I am proud as a woman to convey the message of our comrade and martyr Berta Caceres.@@@Wake up humankind.@@@Time is running out.
