Permit me to extend my heartfelt congratulations to the President on his assumption of the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session. My delegation and I stand unwaveringly by his side, committed to fortifying the bedrock of global unity during his tenure. I offer my profound respect and gratitude to his predecessor. Mr. Csaba Korosi of Hungary, whose deft stewardship of the seventy-seventh session is a guiding beacon for all. The dedication of the Secretary-General. Mr. Antonio Guterres, in weaving together the strands of global consensus in order to combat poverty and planetary crises and champion the Sustainable Development Goals is a testament to his leadership.
The soul of Sierra Leone, echoing the spirit of Pan-Africanism, resonates with the clarion call of this year’s theme to rebuild trust and reignite global solidarity. A testament to our enduring democratic spirit was showcased on 24 June when, in free, fair and peaceful multi-tier elections, the Sierra Leonean people elected their leaders across various tiers of governance. My re-election as President for a second and final term serves not merely as an endorsement of my leadership but also a solemn testament to my Government’s commitment to fashioning a Sierra Leone that thrives as a united, peaceful and dynamic bastion of hope and opportunity — a nation in which our aspirations for abundant jobs, food security, quality education and equitable health care are not mere dreams but manifest realities, and in which justice and opportunity are not the prerogatives of a few but the birth right of all.
In the face of global upheavals, from the pandemic to the geopolitical tensions exemplified by the war in Ukraine and the ensuing food crisis, my first term stood as a beacon of our commitment to democratic freedoms and human rights. We rooted out the unpleasant legacies of the past, repealing antiquated laws such as the seditious libel statute that had lingered for half a century. We consigned the death penalty to the annals of history and charted bold advances against the scourge of corruption.
Our devotion to education was unambiguous. More than 800.000 new learners were introduced under our auspices, and we significantly augmented domestic educational funding, ensuring that it constituted an average of 22 per cent of our national budget. We championed an ethos of radical inclusion, providing unfettered and tuition-free access to quality primary and secondary school education for all.
In our unwavering commitment to dismantling the barriers of gender inequality, my Administration declared a state of emergency for the heinous crimes of rape and sexual and gender-based violence. Sierra Leone urged the global community for solidarity with respect to access to justice and remedies for the survivors of sexual violence and the recognition of 18 November by the General Assembly as the World Day for the Prevention of and Healing from Child Sexual Exploitation. Abuse and Violence.
Our Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment Act of 2022 shows our commitment to equality. With that Act. I proudly inscribed our nation’s pledge to reserve a minimum of 30 per cent of seats in elected and appointed offices for women, while ensuring equal employment opportunities, lengthening maternity leave and compelling our financial institutions to chart pathways that strengthen women’s access to the financial resources that they rightfully deserve.
As I step into my second term, my Government has carved out five pillars that guide our national development trajectory to spur sustainable development and social progress.
First, food security, intertwined with investment in agriculture, is poised not just to feed our nation but to fuel job creation, propel economic growth and alleviate the weight of poverty.
Secondly, our human capital development is meticulously crafted for the modern era, with a special lens focused on gender equality.
Thirdly, our youth employment scheme promises our younger generation that their energy, passion and ambition will find fertile ground in Sierra Leone.
Fourthly, our cutting-edge technology and infrastructure programme was conceptualized to pave sustainable pathways of economic ascent.
Fifthly, a thorough revamp of our public service architecture refines its essence for the utmost efficiency, professionalism and service delivery.
Seventy-eight years ago, the United Nations was born of the profound understanding that peace, development and human rights are inextricably intertwined. Each element nourishes the other, creating an equilibrium that is essential for global harmony. As we stand at this juncture, let us remember the noble ambitions enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations — to foster international cooperation and confront and surmount challenges, be they economic, social, cultural or humanitarian in nature. It is in unity and shared purpose that the promise of a brighter, just and peaceful world is realized.
The resonant theme of the current session of the General Assembly therefore opens a horizon of possibilities, beckoning us to harmoniously forge ahead in the shared pursuit of “accelerating action on the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals towards peace, prosperity, progress and enduring sustainability for all”. Our world faces formidable challenges — widespread poverty, persistent hunger, the looming shadow of climate change and the unsettling presence of sustained and emerging conflicts. To honour our 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development commitments, the States Members of the United Nations must rekindle the fires of trust and galvanize a renaissance of global solidarity.
Trust requires the harmonious amalgamation of our collective wisdom and resources. Solidarity mandates our unwavering cohesion, even when navigating different or opposing philosophical terrains. In pursuing the 2030 Agenda, we must resolve to leave no one behind. We must fervently champion inclusivity, recognizing the intrinsic value of every individual, irrespective of their circumstances.
Progress has been made, but we acknowledge that the road ahead is challenging. However, that challenge also presents an opportunity for innovation, collaboration and reimagining our global priorities.
On peace and security in the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) region, we view with deep concern the rising tides of insecurity and the subtle erosion of democratic governance and ideals in the West African subregion and the Sahel. Sierra Leone raises its voice alongside our ECOWAS allies, expressing unequivocal dissent towards any extraconstitutional changes of Government. Such challenges to the very bedrock of our democracy threaten the stability of individual nations and the fabric of our collective African identity.
While we stand united, it is not simply a call to maintain things as they are. Real stability and lasting peace do not come from resisting threats or building defences. Instead, they arise from genuine, open conversations. True dialogue requires that everyone at the negotiating table be ready to seek and find common ground.
While we emphasize the importance of dialogue, we cannot ignore a crucial reality — the ongoing threats to our continent’s constitutional stability are signs of deeper problems. Every action that undermines the rule of law is connected to underlying issues. Those range from past and present injustices to the burdens of poverty and widespread unemployment and the dangers of discrimination. Our duty is clear — we must lift our people from poverty. We should focus on creating jobs and supporting industries that benefit our countries and our continent.
I would now like to talk about national electoral reform. As vehicles of democratic transformation, elections fortify governance and enable peaceful transitions. After our nation’s multi-tier elections on 24 June, we stand resolved to strengthen our democratic foundations. Recognizing the significance of deepening our democracy. I have instituted a National Electoral Systems Review Committee to address historical challenges in our electoral process.
Since our first multi-tier elections were conducted after the civil war ended in 2002, the electoral process has been plagued with persistent challenges, including contestations of declared presidential election results by the constitutionally mandated Electoral Commissioner. To address those historical challenges and consolidate our democratic gains, a comprehensive review of the electoral system is necessary in order to reform Sierra Leone’s electoral landscape.
The National Electoral Systems Review Committee will comprise the Government, civil society, political parties, professional organizations and development partners. It holds the mantle of evaluating existing frameworks, institutional arrangements and observer mission reports. Its mandate extends to proposing vital reforms fortifying Sierra Leone’s electoral integrity. Those actions encapsulate our commitment to forging a fertile environment for dialogue, affirming democratic governance and fostering enduring peace.
It is regrettable to note the decision of certain Member States to introduce unilateral coercive measures, including visa restrictions, on Sierra Leonean citizens following the recent multi-tier national elections. We observe that such unilateral measures, which are in contravention of international law, have sometimes been the response to electoral outcomes in other African nations to exert political pressure.
As members of the international rules-based community. African States strive for sovereignty and meaningful cooperation based on mutual respect and understanding. In democratic processes, every democracy faces unique challenges. However, the essence of sovereignty, as contained in the United Nations Charter, is the ability of Member States to address and resolve internal matters independently and without external pressure.
In our engagement on the international stage, we hope for understanding and mutual respect, especially on important issues like national elections. Constructive dialogue and open channels of communication should be the pillars of our global interactions and not punitive unilateral coercive measures that do not further entrench democracy but instead strain relations between nations.
Sierra Leone remains steadfast in its commitment to free, fair and credible elections, alongside our dedication to the rule of law. We believe that democratic progress is a journey and that its pace varies from one nation to another. We respect the individual paths countries have taken in their quest for democracy and anticipate the same level of understanding and respect for ours. We aspire to nurture relationships rooted in solidarity, cooperation and mutual respect, all directed towards a shared global future.
With regard to our Security Council tenure, as Sierra Leone takes its non-permanent seat on the Council for the 2024-2025 term, after a hiatus of 53 years, we are deeply aware of our shared duty to uphold international peace and security. The profound nexus between peace, development and human rights will be the beacon guiding our priorities. We stand poised, resolute and committed to forging a world where those ideals are not mere aspirations, but enduring realities for all.
Sierra Leone fully subscribes to the ideals of multilateralism as a tool for global peace and security. Our vision is to serve as the vital conduit linking the ECOWAS community, the African Union and the nations under consideration with the Security Council. As we yearn for tranquillity and justice, we pledge our commitment to collaborate with the five permanent 
members of the Security Council as one of the 10 elected members and three African representatives.
On Security Council reform. Sierra Leone recognizes the pressing issue of the Security Council’s legitimacy, equitable representation and transparency. In a world reshaped by geopolitical realities, true global peace and security hinge upon the reform and rejuvenation of the Security Council and the General Assembly.
Joined by fellow United Nations Member States. Sierra Leone committed at the 2005 World Summit to support Security Council reform as an essential element of our overall effort to reform the United Nations in order to make it more broadly representative, efficient and transparent and thus to enhance further its effectiveness and the legitimacy and implementation of its decisions.
While the discourse has seen forward movement, the historical injustices endured by the African continent remain unresolved in the intergovernmental negotiations. Africa glaringly stands alone as the only region without permanent representation within the Security Council and is conspicuously unrepresented in its non-permanent category.
The Security Council remains trapped in the era of 1945, when much of Africa was still in the regrettable grip of colonialism. We must not allow this colonial ethos to persist three quarters of a century later.
Africa’s demand for two permanent seats — complete with commensurate rights, including the veto, if maintained — and five non-permanent seats are issues of equity, justice and our right to have an equal say in decision-making on issues that affect the African region. Our conviction is steadfast. Security Council reform should squarely confront this longstanding inequity and imbalance, addressing Africa’s unique circumstances.
As the Coordinator of the African Union Committee of Ten Heads of State and Government on the reform of the Security Council. Sierra Leone will continue to advocate and garner support among Member States and other interest groups for the Common African Position, as enshrined in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration. We will also engage in reviewing the working methods of the Council in order to instil transparency, accountability, democracy and, ultimately, renewed legitimacy.
With regard to climate change, our collective pursuit of sustainable development confronts the triple planetary crises of pollution, climate change and biodiversity loss. Despite contributing minimally to these crises. Sierra Leone remains intensely vulnerable to their repercussions, a reality compounded by our limited capacity to cope. Our national adaptation plan, launched in 2018, stands as an embodiment of our commitment. Designed to halve our vulnerability by 2030, it underscores risk awareness, regulatory enhancements, institutional empowerment and gender- responsive adaptation strategies.
Sierra Leone seeks equitable and timely access to climate financing. We request unfettered access to leverage new climate change adaptation and mitigation technologies and shared knowledge. Our salvation from the escalating climate change crisis lies in collective wisdom and concerted efforts.
With regard to global solidarity, in today’s complex world, the urgent need to rebuild trust and strengthen global unity stands out. We must adopt a cooperative approach, set aside individualistic actions and promote shared progress based on common values. As we deal with disputes of sovereignty and self-determination across the world, we must also resolve to do so through dialogue, exhausting all avenues for peaceful resolution.
In conclusion, in this evolving multipolar world, where conflicts ripple across borders and power dynamics are in flux, we must recognize our shared interests and intertwined destinies. The multifaceted crises challenging our global community demand unified action, for our collective strength is determined by our most vulnerable segments.
The choices we make today have far-reaching implications for tomorrow. We stand at a crossroads: one path leads to mere rhetorical commitments to equity and solidarity, while the other beckons us to act with conviction, driven by the profound belief in equity and justice — economic, social and political justice. Let us choose wisely, for the fate of generations to come hinges on the decisions we make now.
